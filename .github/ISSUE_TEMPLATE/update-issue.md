Before submitting an issue be sure you have read and understand the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Updates to the website must be approved by a member of the Conventions Committee and Standard Names Committee, the Governance Panel, or someone to whom they have delegated this responsibility.
Updates should reflect decisions that have already been made by the Governance Panel or one of the Committees.
They can be merged immediately after approval.

In special cases the governance committee may temporarily nominate people to self-approve updates on a specific topic.
Such a nomination must have a clearly defined scope and expiration point.
Examples of reasons for such limited-scope self-approval nominations include keeping meeting pages up-to-date with links and meeting materials or recording the minutes of meetings.
