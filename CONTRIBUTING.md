# Contributing to the netCDF-CF Conventions website

Dear CF community member,

Thank you for taking the time to consider making a contribution to the [website of the cf-conventions](cf-website).

This set of guidelines provides an overview of the process for making changes to the website.
Separate guidelines apply for [changing the CF Conventions or proposing standard names](contribute-conventions).
If you have a general question about CF matters, please raise them as issues in the [discuss repository](discuss).

When raising an issue, please use the appropriate issue template.
The template explains the approval process for issues of that type and automatically adds the correct label to the issue you create.
Consider associating that issue to a pull request that implements the proposed change.
Each issue template notes that the approval of one or more members of the following bodies is necessary for the proposed change to be merged:
- The [CF Information Management and Support Team](info-mgmt),
- The [Conventions Committee and Standard Names Committee](committee), or
- The [Governance Panel](gov-panel)

When closing an issue, the moderator should note in the final comment any users who have contributed significantly enough to warrant addition to the [CF Conventions Contributors List](https://cfconventions.org/conventions_contributors.html).
