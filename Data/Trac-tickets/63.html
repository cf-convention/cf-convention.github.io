GRIDSPEC to aggregate block-structured and time dependent data

Current conventions support logical rectangular data stored in a single file. The proposed extension will allow users to aggregate data stored in multiple files, whether the data represent different time slices or are associated with different logically rectangular grids as in the case of the cubed sphere mosaic for instance. 
</p>
<h1 id="a4.InitialStatementofTechnicalProposal">4. Initial Statement of Technical Proposal</h1>
<p>
GRIDSPEC comprises of two parts: M-SPEC for representing the grid connectivity in mosaics and F-SPEC for time and mosaic data aggregation. 
</p>
<p>
For M-SPEC, a mosaic file contains the list of files where grid information can be extracted with inter-tile connectivity information provided as a map between the set of indices on one tile to indices on the neighbouring tile. This covers both surfacial and volumetric coupling. The former arises for instance when two three-dimensional grids share a surface while the latter arises when the grids are overlapping. 
</p>
<p>
The F-SPEC describes the format of the host file, which acts as a single entry point to the aggregation. Variable data scattered among many files appear as one logical entity when viewed through the host file. Brittleness, in other words the fragility of the aggregation resulting from inadvertent file corruption, file movement and other file operations, is minimized by consolidating all the file names in the host file, which can be straightforwardly re-generated by scanning directories and inspecting the global attributes of the files residing therein. 
</p>
<h1 id="a5.Benefits">5. Benefits</h1>
<p>
Data producers will be able to store data in multiple files while allowing data consumers to access the data as if all the data were stored in a single file. 
</p>
<p>
A number of codes are moving away from longitude-latitude grids because of the singularity of such grids at the pole, which can cause severe limitations in the maximum time steps than models can take. M-SPEC will allow atmospheric and ocean models to store data on their native grids, without having to incur inaccuracies due to lon-lat regridding. 
</p>

Because of the length of this proposal, a separate <a class="ext-link" href="https://ice.txcorp.com/trac/modave/wiki/CFProposalGridspec"><span class="icon">​</span>web page</a> was created to explain in more details our proposed enhancements.

Dear Alex
</p>
<p>
Thank you for making this proposal and for the email discussions we have already had about it, which have cleared up several questions I had. I'd like to raise a few remaining issues.
</p>
<ol><li>I think the attribute name <tt>cf_type_name</tt> for identifying the purpose of variables containing gridspec information is unnecessarily general. Unless you foresee a very closely related application for this attribute, I would suggest you use something less general and hence more informative, such as <tt>gridspec_type_name</tt>.
</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Please could you clarify whether spaces are allowed or not surrounding <tt>:</tt> in the contact lists? As you know, I would favour allowing space but ignoring it, in order to reduce the number of syntax errors which may occur. I don't think it would make much difference to legibility or parsing.
</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>I think that it should be allowed to contain the grid and/or data from more than one tile in a given file. (In general I think we should be as flexible as possible regarding how things are distributed among files; files are only containers for variables and, as Steve Hankin has pointed out, files are fictional when data is not being served directly from a file store.) To enable that, the <tt>tile_name</tt> would have to be allowed as a variable attribute as an alternative to a global attribute.
</li></ol><ol start="4"><li>I do not see the need to separate static from time-dependent variables. It is easy to tell whether a variable is time-dependent, by examining its coordinates.
</li></ol><p>
Best wishes

      <p>
This comment is to follow up on the discussion of the merits of "cf_type_name" versus "gridspec_type_name".  In a separate discussion of the CF Discrete Geometries conventions a very similar need has arisen for an attribute that captures the role that a variable plays within a (complex) CF dataset.  Similar issues have also arisen in the CF satellite conventions and the conventions for unstructured grids (meshes).
</p>
<p>
John Caron has suggested the simpler attribute name, "cf_role" in the context of the Discrete Geometries discussions.  If CF includes a well-managed controlled vocabulary of string values for this attribute, it can satisfy the needs of all of these different conventions, leading to a CF standard that is arguably leaner, cleaner and more easily extensible without the risk of attribute name collisions. 
</p>
<p>
In the case of gridspec I propose that "cf_role" be used in place of "gridspec_type"name" leading to the following controlled vocabulary entries:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
o cf_role = "gridspec_coordinate_names"
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
o cf_role = "gridspec_tile_contacts"
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
o cf_role = "gridspec_contact_map"
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
o cf_role = "gridspec_mosaic_filename"
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
o cf_role = "gridspec_static_data_filename"
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
o cf_role = "gridspec_time_data_filename"

<blockquote>
<p>
o cf_role = "gridspec_tile_names"

I'm still not entirely happy about this, but I do appreciate the arguments in favour of it, so I accept the majority view. My concern is that we must be careful not to use a <tt>cf_role</tt> as a general-purpose dustbin/trashcan attribute in future when we could define something more specific and informative instead.

You would use other metadata, such as <tt>standard_name</tt>. CF explicitly does not standardise variable names (section 2.5). You aren't doing that either, but by depending on the names of variables in this way, gridspec is assigning more meaning to them than CF generally does, though your convention here is rather like the Unidata convention for identifying coordinate variables. I think this restriction is OK, but it could be stated up-front in F-SPEC that the tiles must be in separate files and that variables in those files which contribute to the same logical variable must have the same name. You probably state that - but maybe not prominently enough?

Since this can be inferred by examining dimensions and coordinates, it's a restriction which could be avoided. However, I accept you are not trying to solve the most general problem.

<p>
Thanks Jonathan. I agree, that was not clearly expressed. We had 
</p>
<p>
Restriction:
</p>
<ul><li>Time steps must be partitioned into data files in a consistent manner across all tiles.
</li><li>Variables must be partitioned into data files in a consistent manner across all tiles. 
</li></ul><p>
Now we have:
</p>
<p>
Restriction:
</p>
<ul><li>Time steps must be partitioned into data files in a consistent manner across all files. The same partitioning in time is assumed for all tiles and for all time dependent variables.
</li><li>Variables must be partitioned into data files in a consistent manner across all files. The variable names used in the different tile data files and time data files must be the same as there is no other mechanism to identify a collection of variables as belonging to the same logical entity. 
</li></ul><p>
The above restrictions allow one to represent the aggregation in array form suitable for rapid access and time slice indexing.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again for the feedback.

Best,

<p>
Now for the nitpicking:
</p>
<ol><li>attribute naming (esp 10.2.2)

I think prefixing all attribute names (global and variable) consistently (eg with "gridspec_") would be good. Then you dont need to prefix attribute values (eg file_type values).

</li></ol><p>
You use "structured grid" without defining i think. is this a synonym for "logical rectangular grid" ?

</li></ol><p>
"coordinates must be supplied as D-Dimensional objects where D is the number of space dimensions". perhaps "variables" is better than "objects" ? Also, this seems to imply one needs (x,y,z) but a common case is (x,y) x z. 
</p>
<ol start="4"><li>(10.5) Restrictions, 5th paragraph
</li></ol><p>
"multiples of 90 deg in index space" doesnt make much sense to me. indices are just numbers, not sure what "90 deg" refers to.
</p>
<ol start="5"><li>(10.5) encoding of contact ranges
</li></ol><p>
Encoding a series of numbers in ascii seems like a bad idea. why not use 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
int contact_range(ncontacts, 4) or something?
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6"><li>(10.5) encoding of contact ranges
</li></ol><p>
Is it needed to allow ranges to go negetive? If not, why not just one encoding, presumably the positive one?
I dont have any real problem with [start, end+1), but i would think [start, end] might be more natural.
</p>
<ol start="7"><li>(10.6.1) file name dependent on OS

I would highly recomend not allowing OS dependencies in your encoding if possible. I would suggest standardizing on "/".

</li></ol><p>
You probably should give an example of reletive file resolution. How does one tell if its absolute or reletive file path? Can CFlib supply a routine which does this, perhaps also converting between canonical and OS form?
</p>
<p>
It would be very helpful to have sample files to look at also.

<p>
Very good point. I think in this case it is sufficient to concentrate on the (x, y) part of the grid since the vertical axis acts as an independent dimension. I will need to add something regarding this case. In the mean time I added the definition of mixed rectilinear-curvilinear grid.

<p>
Thanks, clarified. 
</p>
<p>
Two tiles that share a contact must have parallel index axes. This means that contacts can only involve foldings that are multiples of 90 deg. in index space, or equivalently rotation matrices whose elements are either 0, -1, or 1. For instance, the <tt>i</tt> index on one tile can map to the <tt>j</tt> index on the neighboring tile but not to a mixture of <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> indices. See section 10.5.2 for an example of rotation in index space that is not a multiple of 90 deg.

It could be more natural in the sense that the reverse iterator [end, start] would appear symmetric to [start, end]. Let put this to the vote.

Hi John,
</p>
<p>
Following your recommendation, the syntax for expressing ranges has been changed so that the end indices are now inclusive, ie containing the last valid index.  The change has been propagated to the wiki and to LibCF. Thanks for your suggestion.
</p>

Hi John,

I would highly recomend not allowing OS dependencies in your encoding if possible. I would suggest standardizing on "/".

<p>
The need for '/' exists only in the host file, the only file allowed to refer explicitly to a file name. The host file is not meant to be ported to another platform. F-SPEC allows for a cheap (re-)generation of the host file, should the files be transferred to another platform. 
</p>
<p>
Only in the cases where a file system is made globally accessible through NFS or some other mechanism would it make sense to write the data in the host file in portable way across Unix-Windows. In such a case, it should be sufficient to run the application from a cygwin window to convert '/' to '\'.
</p>
<p>
The issue of converting '/' automatically to '\' on Windows sounds easy but there are subtle issues related to file path portability that cannot be addressed simply. What to do with "C:\" or the case sensitivity of some file systems (incl. Mac OS X) ? What if the host file lists Foo.nc and foo.nc? Perfectly valid on unix bt perhaps not on Windows. 
</p>
<p>
For the above reasons, we prefer to leave the responsibility to encode correct the file paths to the application that generates the host file for the time being.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your suggestions. 
</p>
<p>
Best,
</p>

There haven't been any further objections or comments for more than three weeks, so the moderator of the ticket (Balaji) could declare this change to be accepted according to the rules.
