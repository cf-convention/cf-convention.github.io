      Description
    </h3>
    <div class="searchable">
      <p>
In this ticket we do not propose any change to the CF standard. This ticket concerns an abstract model for data and metadata corresponding to the existing standard (version 1.5). As a netCDF convention, up to now the CF standard has not included a data model. However, the design of CF implies a data model to some extent. Following the discussion at the GO-ESSP meeting, we now propose that the data model should be made explicit, as an independent element of CF, separate from the CF standards and conformance documents, to be updated for successive CF versions in line with those documents. We consider that defining an explicit data model will contribute to the CF goal to help in "building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities."
</p>
<p>
We have drafted a <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/cfdm.html"><span class="icon">​</span>document</a> that describes the data model, with an associated <a class="ext-link" href="http://cf-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cf/docs/cf_data_model_UML_v0.2.pdf"><span class="icon">​</span>UML diagram</a> to illustrate it. The description follows from the one discussed earlier this year on the CF email list, which pointed out the need for a diagram. The proposed data model avoids prescribing more than is needed for interpreting CF as it stands, in order to avoid inconsistency with future developments of CF.
</p>
<p>
The document describes both the proposed CF data model and how it is implemented in netCDF. These are distinct purposes. The same data model could be implemented in other non-netCDF-like file formats, and that would require the description of the model and implementation to be separated. We have not done that in this version of the document because we think that it would make it harder to understand at this stage.
</p>
<p>
Following discussions on the email list and at GO-ESSP, we are aware that this attempt to describe the CF data model overlaps with other work on data models, especially the Unidata CDM. It will be useful to discuss the relationship between these. The proposed CF data model corresponds less closely to netCDF storage concepts than the CDM does, and in that sense it is more abstract.
</p>
<p>
We have also developed a minimal <a class="ext-link" href="http://code.google.com/p/cf-python"><span class="icon">​</span>implementation</a> of the data model in Python, including documentation. (Note: since putting this up, we've discovered that there is an existing package called cfpython, which is not related to CF. That is confusing, so we might have to change the name of ours.) The software reads and writes CF-netCDF files, and contains the data and metadata in memory in objects called spaces in a way which is consistent with the data model. It is possible to select a subset of the spaces according to their properties, to extract subspaces by specifying ranges of coordinates or indices along the dimensions, and to modify the metadata. We describe this implementation as "minimal" because it doesn't provide any processing or graphical functions, and it doesn't extend to the level of the scientific feature types of the CDM, for instance. This software might be useful:
</p>
<ul><li>To illustrate the data model.
</li></ul><ul><li>As a reference implementation of CF. In all versions of CF so far published, all changes have been introduced and are marked as provisional, because of the requirement of two demonstrated implementations of new features before changes are accepted as permanent. This software could provide one implementation. The CF checker could be another. (The cf-python software attempts to interpret netCDF files by reference to the CF convention, but does not require or check complete compliance.)
</li></ul><ul><li>As a basis for data processing and graphical software in Python based on CF concepts. For this purpose, the API is the essence. Other code could be written which offered the same API to the CF data model. All Python code using the same API to the minimal CF data model would be interoperable at that level.
</li></ul><p>
To be clear, we are not proposing this Python code as an element of CF. It could be useful to people dealing with CF-netCDF data, but this proposal is really about the CF data model, which we are proposing as an element of CF. The first of the above points is therefore the most important to this proposal.
</p>
<p>
We hope that people will consider this proposal. We will welcome comments on this ticket on both the data model and the Python API. (However, comments on the code itself would probably be better made by email, unless they are matters of principle.)
</p>
<p>
We are grateful to Bryan Lawrence and Dominic Lowe for very thoughtful discussions.

One quick comment about the description of attributes:
</p>
<p>
"Other properties, which are metadata that do not refer to the dimensions, and serve to describe the data the space contains. Properties may be of any data type (numeric, character or string) and can be scalars or arrays. They are attributes in the netCDF file, but we use the term "property" instead because not all CF-netCDF attributes are properties in this sense."
</p>
<p>
The spec recommends that information that's multidimensional should be stored as a variable, not an attribute; I think the statement "not all CF-netCDF attributes are properties in this sense" could be amended to say "not all CF-netCDF attributes are properties in this sense, and not all such properties are stored as attributes in CF-netCDF."

I understand your point, but I can't think of any CF property to which it would apply. I think that all the CF metadata which is not stored in netCDF attributes is described under some other heading of the data model e.g. coordinates and transforms. The "properties" are just the ones which are left, and I think they're all CF-netCDF attributes, unless we've missed something?

Jonathan, David,
</p>
<p>
I wonder if there is an opportunity here to unify, where appropriate, some of the terminology with that used in similar geospatial conceptual models (e.g. CDM, OGC). The draft document uses a handful of new terms which do not seem to be part of the CF vernacular - at least not the one with which I'm familiar from e.g. the CF mailing list. (To be fair, you do state in the opening paragraph that you are desribing an abstract data model for CF because one currently does not exist. So to that extent the use of some new terms is perhaps unavoidable.)
</p>
<p>
An example is the concept that you call <em>dimension coordinate</em>. This would seem to equate roughly with the well-known CF-netCDF concept (or construct) called <em>coordinate variable</em>, and indeed the latter term is used in the definition of dimension coordinates. Would using the existing concept name (or else CoordinateAxis, the CDM analogue) make more sense here, or are they envisaged as distinct concepts/entities?
</p>
<p>
Similarly, under the description of a space construct you say: <em>"The data array would be missing if the space construct serves only to define a coordinate system, which we call a grid"</em>. In which case, why not refer to this concept as just that, a <em>coordinate system</em> rather than as a grid? IMO, coordinate system is the correct term here. It's also the term used in the CDM. As a sub-species of coordinate system, the term 'grid' has, I think, more specific connotations in the eyes/minds of the majority of spatial data users.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I wonder if would be helpful to readers if each concept/construct was illustrated with CDL examples, in much the same way as is done for the current CF specification. If you felt that this would interrupt the flow of the document then one might consider i) inserting hyperlinks to examples, or ii) producing a separate "Illustrated CF Data Model" which included inline examples.
</p>
<p>

Phil

<p>
We use ancillary variables to describe properties like accuracy &amp; provenance; these can't be stored as attributes because they're two dimensional. Maybe this kind of property doesn't belong in the description of the data model, but it should also not be ruled out by the document.  
</p>
<p>
Maybe I'm not interpreting the phrase "properties, which are metadata that do not refer to the dimensions" correctly?

Yes, this is allowed for in the data model, but they're not "properties" in the terms of this document. They are mentioned in the section about the space construct. One of the things it can contain is
</p>

<p>
A list of ancillary spaces. This corresponds to the CF-netCDF <tt>ancillary_variables</tt> attribute, which identifies other spaces that provide metadata.

That is, they are different spaces (data variables) altogether, but the relationship between the spaces is noted in this way. Is that OK?

Thanks for your comment. I agree, we should not avoid unnecessary differences of terminology! We did not use the same terminology as CF-netCDF in all cases in order to avoid confusion, but it might be that this is not a sufficient reason. Specifically:
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
An example is the concept that you call <em>dimension coordinate</em>. This would seem to equate roughly with the well-known CF-netCDF concept (or construct) called <em>coordinate variable</em>, and indeed the latter term is used in the definition of dimension coordinates. Would using the existing concept name (or else CoordinateAxis, the CDM analogue) make more sense here, or are they envisaged as distinct concepts/entities?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We did not call it just a <em>coordinate construct</em> because of the perennial difficulty in CF-netCDF that <em>coordinate variable</em> (a Unidata term) and <em>auxiliary coordinate variable</em> (a CF term) are distinct concepts. An auxiliary coordinate variable is not a special kind of coordinate variable, in CF-netCDF terms. That is confusing, I think. To avoid it, we oppose <em>dimension coordinate construct</em> and <em>auxiliary coordinate construct</em>. In this CF data model, they are two different kinds of coordinate construct. They have a lot in common - more than they do in CF-netCDF in fact. Instead of the word <em>dimension</em> we could have used <em>axis</em>, but that is confusing too, now that we have decided that the CF-netCDF <tt>axis</tt> attribute can be applied to auxiliary coordinate variables!
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
under the description of a space construct you say: <em>"The data array would be missing if the space construct serves only to define a coordinate system, which we call a grid"</em>.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think a <em>coordinate system</em> refers to, for instance, lat-lon, or a Mercator projection, or vertical hybrid-pressure. In the space, there might be several such coordinate systems. We need a term that refers to a collection of them, along with transforms and cell measures, that is all the things which describe the space itself, but not the data in it. I agree, <em>grid</em> is not a great term for this. Suggestions welcomed.

<p>
The implementation in netCDF is very complicated. That might make the data model description approach the length of the current CF-netCDF standard. But maybe it would help if we linked the relevant sections of the standard? We did not want to put much about netCDF specifically in this document, since the idea is try to describe the model independently of its implementation. The reason for that is to help thinking about how to hold it in memory, or in other file formats.

Hi Jonathan, David:
</p>
<p>
I think it is very important to have another independent implementation of CF, and Python is an obvious choice. So Im hoping that the Python programmers will look at your API carefully and start using it etc. We need to try out our ideas in code before we standardize them, and this seems like a great advance in that regard.
</p>
<p>
I will try to understand and comment on the data model component, and add some comparisons to the CDM.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Replying to <a class="new ticket" href="./68.html" title="enhancement: CF data model and reference implementation in Python (new)">jonathan</a>:
</p>
<p>
We thought that it may be useful to compare the proposed CF data model with the OGC CF-netCDF data model being written up by Ben Domenico and Stefano Nativi. This is definitely not meant to be a beauty contest (the two models have different purposes, anyway), rather to help a discussion on the usefulness of an abstract, core CF data model and whether or not what we have proposed is correct.
</p>
<p>
The draft CF data model is as decribed in Trac ticket <a class="new ticket" href="./68.html" title="enhancement: CF data model and reference implementation in Python (new)">#68</a>, except we have an <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~david/cf_data_model_UML_v0.3.pdf"><span class="icon">​</span>amended UML diagram</a> with a more correct positioning of the Transform construct. The text desciption has not needed to be changed.
</p>
<p>
The OGC CF-netCDF data model is described in OGC's <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~david/CF-netCDF-ExtensionFor-netCDF_Data_Model_10-Nov-2011.pdf"><span class="icon">​</span>CF-netCDF Data Model extension specification (version 2.1.1)</a>. The relevant UML diagrams are figures 3 and 4 on pages 13 and 14.
</p>
<p>
The OGC model includes CF version 1.6 extensions, whilst the proposed CF data model is describing strictly CF version 1.5, so items such as discrete sampling geometries are not considered here.

All the best,

<p>
<strong>A comparison of the draft CF model and the OGC CF-netCDF model</strong>
</p>
<p>
Overall, and, unsurprisingly, the draft CF model and the OGC CF-netCDF model are largely similar.
</p>
<p>
An apparent difference is that the OGC CF-netCDF model specifically includes references to the common spatiotemporal coordinate systems (i.e. those whose axes are a subset of T, Z, Y and X), whereas the draft CF model is minimal in that it makes no reference to the nature of its components. However, the existence of spatiotemporal axes is not mandatory in either model so there is no real difference here.
</p>
<p>
The only fundamental areas in which the two models diverge is in their treatment of cell measures, grid mapping and formula terms. These differences may be characterised by the OGC CF-netCDF model staying close to the netCDF representation and the draft CF model aiming to be an abstraction of the netCDF representation. These features are dealt with as follows:
</p>
<h4 id="Cellmeasure">Cell measure</h4>
<ul><li>In the draft CF model this belongs to the grid in exactly the same way as an auxiliary coordinate does. It is a property of the grid in the same manner as an auxiliary coordinate is.
</li></ul><ul><li>In the OGC CF-netCDF model, a cell measure variable has, and depends on, a coordinate's boundary object and does not appear to be as strongly connected to the coordinate system.
</li></ul><h4 id="Gridmappingandformulaterms">Grid mapping and formula terms</h4>
<ul><li>In the draft CF model, these are grouped together as transforms which either specify parameters which define the coordinate system (such as the assumed radius of the earth); or which specify a function of existing coordinates from which an auxiliary coordinate can be computed (like a formula terms object). In both cases, the transform belongs to the space but also belongs to the relevant coordinates. In the latter case, the resulting 'virtual' auxiliary coordinate may, therefore, be brought into existence with a transform object in place of its data array. The expectation is that the data array would be created from the transform's formula on demand.
</li></ul><ul><li>The OGC CF-netCDF model retains the CF separation of horizontal and vertical transformations (grid mapping and formula terms respectively); and also their CF-netCDF place in the data model (contained respectively by the coordinate system and the vertical dimensionless coordinate).
</li></ul><blockquote>
<p>
Neither is incorrect, of course, but noting that grid mappings and formula terms are essentially the same type of object, and that they may belong to both the coordinate system and to a coordinate (or to coordinates) is an inference from CF which conforms with how these constructs are used in real life and hopefully adds to our understanding.
</p>

Hello,
</p>
<p>
I'd like to announce that there is a new version of the CF data model's python reference implementation software - version 0.9.3 of <a class="ext-link" href="http://code.google.com/p/cf-python/"><span class="icon">​</span>cf-python</a>.

There has been no change to the data model, rather this new version of the software is a more logical and correct view of the data model. All details are on the cf-python web site (linked above).

I feel it is important to agree these details before we try to address all of the fine detail of the model, as the scope and implications are likely to affect the nature of the feedback.

I think that this split is a good idea - if we can agree that there is a need for a CF data model, then we ought to find it easier (and be more motivated) on deciding what it should be, using the model proposed in this ticket as a starting point.

One more quick question! In the document, the statement "The data array would be missing if the field construct serves only to define a coordinate system, which we call a space" seems to me to limit the use of empty variables to the special case of defining a coordinate system.
</p>
<p>
Following the NODC NetCDF templates (more or less) I've been using an empty "container variable" to describe instruments; my instrument variable has ancillary variables  (each with the  depth dimension) containing serial numbers, manufacturers, model names etc. 
</p>
<p>
Does this data model limit the use of empty variables, or am I reading the statement  too literally?
</p>
<p>
Thanks - Nan

Hello Nan,
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the question. I don't believe that it was our intention to limit the use of variables without data arrays.
</p>
<p>
It would, however, be very useful to see the CDL of your example, as I fear that I don't yet undertstand it - is the instrument variable 'data' or 'metadata'? Are the ancillary variables (of serial numbers, manufacturer, etc.) in some sense auxiliary coordinates? (not independent questions!). I'm sure the full CDL of would clear it up for me.
</p>
<p>
All the best,
</p>

David

This clearly something to be mindful of. In my mind, if the various (three?) models were hierarchical in that they were genuine subsets of each other, then that would seem quite safe. I don't know if this currently the case.

<p>
I know what you mean. I still have problems with the different arrow heads! However, it was a good tool for distilling our ideas whilst composing the model, and I think is is certainly at the simpler end of such diagrams. A couple of things spring to mind, one simple, one more profound: i) a key describing the connection types and ii) omitting the abstract 'Variable' box at the bottom of the diagram (including instead its features (such as a data array) within each relevant construct's box (dimension coordinate, etc.)). The 'Variable' box is a natural element to include when you've got your head in OO programming mode, but perhaps adds unnecessary complexity to the minimal model?

<p>
The aim of the data model to me is that it should be that it is necessary <em>and</em> sufficient, so any extensions in an API should be conveniences rather than truly novel relationships and IO in arbitrary data formats should be possible. If this were not the case, I would argue that the data model is missing a meaningful and useful connection which should be considered for inclusion. Perhaps this view is too idealistic?

Dear Karl,
</p>
<p>
A few first-thought responses to most of your detailed data model comments as given the attached pdf. I hope that I have interpreted your points correctly.
</p>
<h3 id="Controlledvocabulariescomments789">Controlled vocabularies (comments 7, 8, 9)</h3>
<p>
I think that these are already covered in the conventions document: 7.2 <em>Cell measures</em> and appendices D <em>Dimensionless Vertical Coordinates</em> and F <em>Grid Mappings</em>. In the last two cases, the both the standard names (e.g. <tt>atmosphere_ln_pressure_coordinate</tt>) and grid mapping names (e.g. <tt>albers_conical_equal_area</tt>) and are controlled Transform names, and their associated parameters (e.g. <tt>lev</tt> and <tt>longitude_of_central_meridian</tt> respectively) are similary specified.
</p>
<h3 id="Gridmappingscomment10">Grid mappings (comment 10)</h3>
<p>
Yes, the usual case is surely to transform to, rather than from, unrotated lat/lon coordinates. Now that multiple grid mappings will be allowed in a CF-netCDF data variable (<a class="ext-link" href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov./70"><span class="icon">​</span>ticket #70</a>), I don't think that we want to restrict the data model in this way, either. 
</p>
<h3 id="Missingdataindicatorcomment12">Missing data indicator (comment 12)</h3>
<p>
I disagree that a named attribute should be part of the model, if I understand the comment correctly. Rephrasing/strengthening the original wording ('The data model supports the idea of missing data') would probably help.
</p>
<h3 id="Globalattributescomment11">Global attributes (comment 11)</h3>
<p>
Perhaps any rules of precedence between netCDF global and netCDF data variables should be omitted from the model altogether, rather being the domain of an API?
</p>
<h3 id="Theexistenceofcoordinatearrayscomments4and5">The existence of coordinate arrays (comments 4 and 5)</h3>
<p>
I think that the reference to the existing netCDF implemention is confusing things here (and elsewhere?). The intention was to highlight the identity  of 'a netCDF dimension which has no identically named with no netCDF coordinate variable' to 'a CF data model <em>dimension construct</em> which has no coordinate array', and that such a dimension construct is required in the data model as the dimension of an <em>auxiliary coordinate construct</em> which accommodates a CF-netCDF string-valued scalar coordinate variable. I reckon that the original text was technically correct - but obfuscated (like this reply!), perhaps? 
</p>
<p>
Many thanks, again, and all the best,
</p>

<p>
I think that liaising with other initiatives could also be part of the terms of reference.  Responsibility for the relationship between the CF data model and the CF specification is already in the suggested terms.

This could be extended, but I think it is worth considering whether it is the responsibility of other projects wanting to benefit from CF to interact with it to maintain the standardisation and guard against future issues arising.

I think UML is a pretty widely used modelling language and I'd be slightly concerned about maintaining multiple different types of figure whilst keeping consistency between them.
</p>
<p>
I think that UML is a good option for this, but I am happy to consider other options, but I would counsel against multiple versions in different forms as raising more issues than it solves.

<p>
I think this is a pretty fine description.  The object model defines semantics and relationships, which can be implemented in many ways, depending on the constraints of the implementation approach.

I consider this data model a good step forward in describing the structure of the data within CF. It is relevant to our ESMF team because working with Tech-X we have developed an initial python interface to a set of powerful parallel regridding capabilities and see potential for contributing to both data model development and a reference python implementation.
</p>
<p>
The ESMF team has developed parallel regridding capabilities which work with the CF <a class="ext-link" href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov./63"><span class="icon">​</span>GridSpec</a> convention for describing logically rectangular grids and with the upcoming UGrid convention for describing unstructured grids.  For example, see <a class="ext-link" href="http://earthsystemmodeling.org/esmf_releases/non_public/ESMF_5_3_0/ESMF_refdoc/node3.html#SECTION03020000000000000000"><span class="icon">​</span>here</a>  for a stand-alone application for generating regrid weights from CF (and non-CF) grid files. We also have the capability to read in grids from files in these formats and allow the user to interpolate between data on the grids within a user application in Fortran (or more limited, in C). We have a working prototype of a python interface to these regrid capabilities (<a class="ext-link" href="http://earthsystemmodeling.org/users/python_doc/html/index.html"><span class="icon">​</span>ESMP</a>) which we are currently extending to support the <a class="ext-link" href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov./63"><span class="icon">​</span>GridSpec</a> and UGrid grid formats.
</p>
<p>
We are interested in how this work could be used as or support a reference implementation of the data model for regridding problems.  A powerful feature of the ESMF strategy, relevant for the CF community, is that it has a general underlying representation of grids that enables regridding among unstructured meshes, logically rectangular grids, and potentially observational data structures. We are interested in understanding and helping to inform development of more complex representations and implementations of grids as the data model progresses.

Dear Bob
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your support. There is a discussion in ticket 88 about whether to adopt a data model in principle, which I think you are agreeing with. I hope that ticket will be concluded soon in the affirmative, and if so we will return to discussing what the data model should be, in this ticket. You are right that it will have to be developed further to support ugrid and Gridspec-M, and it may need some extensions for the discrete sampling geometry feature types of CF 1.6. At the moment, the draft is for CF 1.5.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes

Dear all
</p>
<p>
Ticket 88 has been accepted; that is, we've decided to adopt a data model for CF. Therefore we can resume discussing what it should be. I have updated the <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/cfdm.html"><span class="icon">​</span>draft data model</a> which David and I prepared as part of this ticket, so that it now includes the motivation for the data model, from ticket 88, as a preamble. This document is a proposal for the data model of CF 1.5, which is the first one we have to agree.
</p>
<p>
Cheers

Thanks for the question. I don't believe that it was our intention to limit the use of variables without data arrays.
</p>
<p>
It would, however, be very useful to see the CDL of your example, as I fear that I don't yet undertstand it - is the instrument variable 'data' or 'metadata'? Are the ancillary variables (of serial numbers, manufacturer, etc.) in some sense auxiliary coordinates? (not independent questions!). I'm sure the full CDL of would clear it up for me.

Dear Nan,
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the examples -  I get it. Your examples are entirely consistent with the conceptual model, we just need to tighten up the wording.
</p>
<p>
The text <em>The data array would be missing if the field construct serves only to define a coordinate system, which we call a space</em> could be replaced with something very roughly along the lines of:
</p>
<p>
"A field construct may have no coordinate system (i.e. a 0-d coordinate system) if it has no dimension constructs; or may serve only to define a coordinate system if it has no data array nor metadata usually associated with a data array (e.g. ancillary variables)"
</p>
<p>
This text is clunky, I know, but I hope the intent is clear.
</p>
<p>
All the best,
</p>
<p>
David

Dear Nan
</p>
<p>
I too agree that we don't want the data model to exclude constructions which are not part of CF but not inconsistent with CF, like your instrument variable. Actually I would say there isn't a problem, because I don't think you intend the instrument variable to be a CF field at all. It would look like a data variable to the CF-checker, though, I guess, because the checker doesn't know about your <tt>instrument</tt> attribute.
</p>
<p>
I wonder why you do it with this extra pointing via <tt>instrument</tt>? Couldn't you make the instrument variables themselves ancillaries of the data variable?
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
double TEMP(TIME, DEPTH) ;

    TEMP:standard_name = "sea_water_temperature" ;
    TEMP:coordinates = "TIME DEPTH LATITUDE LONGITUDE" ;

char INST_MFGR(DEPTH, strlen1) ;

    INST_MFGR:long_name = "instrument manufacturer" ;

Referencing the <a class="wiki" href="/trac/wiki/PotentialDataModelTypes">PotentialDataModelTypes</a> wiki, I would like to open discussion on some issues:

<p>
Firstly: the definition of an abstract Coordinate type.

<p>
This has been suggested as a container for common properties of DimensionCoordinate and AuxiliaryCoordinate types.

Is it a sensible construct to have?

Does it add value?

<blockquote>
<p>
I think it does, which I why I propose its inclusion, there appear to be common aspects shared by DimensionCoordinate and AuxiliaryCoordinate which can be defined in one and only one place, e.g.:
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Their indexing relationship to their containing ScalarField/Field
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
The constraint on size/shape from their reference to the ScalarField/Field
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
    
</p>
<p>
Secondly: the definitions of ScalarField and Field:
</p>

<p>
The proposed Field definition includes explicit description of the other types this type may contain.  The ScalarField makes no comment on types it may contain, merely stating

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Should type definitions be explicit about what they may reference or is this the role of the 'Relation' section (as yet not defined)?

Other points I would like to open discussion on:

<p>
CellMeasures:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The type is defined with the name CellMeasures, but the definition and the example suggest the type should be called CellMeasure.  The description suggests this is a singular entity, like Dimension, which a Field may have multiple different instances of.  Does this seem valid?
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
How does a CellMeasure differ from an AuxiliaryCoordinate? The way they link to a <a class="missing wiki">Field/ScalarField?</a> appears very similar, the main difference appears to be in how they might be used. Is this sufficient justification for an explicit type?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
CellMethod/CellMethods
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the proposed definitions, CellMethods, defines a singular type which is an ordered list of similar entries.  The other, Cellmethod, defines a type which implements a single qualification; a ScalarField might have multiple instances of this type.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Is one of these approaches more helpful than the other?

Dear Mark
</p>
<p>
Thanks for promoting discussion of this. All the issues you raise relate to differences between what David and I proposed in this ticket and in <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/cfdm.html"><span class="icon">​</span>our accompanying description of the model</a> on the one hand, and on the other hand the similar but slightly different constructs that you've described in <a class="ext-link" href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/wiki/PotentialDataModelTypes"><span class="icon">​</span>https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/wiki/PotentialDataModelTypes</a>. I would say that there is the same general answer in all cases, that in our proposal David and I attempt to interpret what the CF standard says, with the minimum of constructs. That's not the same thing as defining the objects which might be used in a software implementation. You might have more classes in that case. cf-python and our UML diagram do have more. However, the ones listed in the document are what we propose as implementation-neutral essentials.
</p>
<p>
<strong>abstract Coordinate type</strong>, of which dimension coordinates and auxiliary coordinates are particular cases. I don't think the CF standard implies this abstraction. It always talks of (Unidata) coordinate variables or auxiliary coordinate variables; when conventions apply to both, it mentions both. I agree of course that there is a similarity between these, and it's very likely it would be convenient to have an abstract class for it in software due to shared functionality, but you don't need this type to describe the CF standard or CF-netCDF data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>ScalarField and Field</strong>. The difference is small between these, and I may have missed your point. One difference might be that you see ScalarField as containing the numerical sizes of the dimensions of the field, whereas David and I suggest that the Field contains Dimensions, and the Dimensions know what their sizes are. We wrote it that way because it resembles netCDF. For instance, tas(lon,lat) knows that its dimensions are lon and lat, but the numerical sizes of lon and lat are in the definitions of the dimensions, not the definition of tas. Another difference you might be pointing to is whether the field <em>contains</em> the other things (coordinates, metadata) or not. I think it does, and your example appears to indicate that the ScalarField does contain metadata such as units. Yes, I think the Field does contain all the other things. This is because in CF-netCDF the data variable is the central point of reference, to which all the other information is related. That other information would not have a purpose in a CF-netCDF variable if no data variable referred to it, and this feels like a relationship of containment to us.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CellMeasure</strong>. I had put CellMeasures by mistake and have corrected it now; in the data model description we have CellMeasure, as you say - thanks. The purposes of cell measures and auxiliary coordinates are distinct in the CF standard. Coordinates locate the data in the space, and cell measures provide metrics for the space. However their form is similar, and you might treat them together in software for some purposes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CellMethods or CellMethod</strong>. We adopted CellMethods because the order of the methods may be significant, as recorded in the CF-netCDF <tt>cell_methods</tt> attribute. If CellMethods was not a construct, the order of methods would have to be remembered in some other component of the Field, but that doesn't resemble the CF convention so closely, we thought.
</p>
<p>
We could also discuss the Transform construct of our data model. This is the biggest departure in our proposal from CF-netCDF. We are not proposing to change the CF standard, but we suggest that logically you can see the mechanisms for dimensionless vertical coordinates and grid mappings fulfilling the same function, the former for vertical coordinates, the latter (so far) for horizontal coordinates. We propose Transform as a single construct which serves both purposes; it's not an abstract layer which has two constructs as particular instances, but it does the job of both of them.
</p>
<p>
Our argument is that it's simpler to view it like this in the data model, and the distinction that is made in CF-netCDF files is just a matter of the file format. If we design a standard to encode CF data in some other file format, perhaps we would not make the distinction between dimensionless vertical coordinates and grid mappings. An analogous situation is that in our proposed data model we say that 1D coordinate variables with dimension of size 1 and scalar coordinate variables are logically the same in the data model. The distinction is just a matter of convenience in writing the CF-netCDF file.

I agree with this statement of objective. I do not think that the ideas I am posting about are focussed on defining object/class definitions for a particular implementation; they are absolutely aimed at the implementation neutral model.

I feel these are differences in the interpretation of the core concepts of CF.

<p>
I think these are helpful clarification statements and may well be an important part of why CellMeasure and AuxiliaryCoordinate are considered seperate types.
</p>
<p>
To further investigate this particular question, we could ask the general question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If form is similar but purpose is distinct, should two types be distinct, or should they be related to each other?

<p>
This is an interesting point.  I think that the ScalarField/Field knows the numerical sizes of all the dimensions, as an array of data values, with a particular size is part of the Field.  
</p>
<p>
As such I think that in the model, this information is held by the field and provided, in relevant subsets to the types of coordiante and cell measure as necessary.  This is why I consider the Dimension not to be the most useful type;; I would rather have DimensionCoordiante which is constrained to match its size to a dimension of the Field.
</p>
<p>
You raise numerous other interesting points which I will have to come back to.

Dear Mark,
</p>
<p>
Interesting points - thanks - but on the issue of dimensions I still take the other view and I'll try to explain why.
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
<strong>CellMeasure</strong>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree - it should be CellMeasure, in much the same way as we have AuxiliaryCoordinate (without an 's').
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
To further investigate this particular question, we could ask the general question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If form is similar but purpose is distinct, should two types be distinct, or should they be related to each other?
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
As far as a data model goes, I think purpose wins, that is I don't think constructs should be in some way related solely because their implmented forms might be similar.
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
This is an interesting point.  I think that the ScalarField/Field knows the numerical sizes of all the dimensions, as an array of data values, with a particular size is part of the Field.  
</p>
<p>
As such I think that in the model, this information is held by the field and provided, in relevant subsets to the types of coordiante and cell measure as necessary.  This is why I consider the Dimension not to be the most useful type;; I would rather have DimensionCoordiante which is constrained to match its size to a dimension of the Field.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My take on this is that I think that you need a Dimension construct rather than a DimensionCoordinate construct, because a dimension needs an <em>identity</em>, as well as a size. You can't rely on the Field's data array to facilitate links between dimensions and coordinates since i) the dimension order of the array is arbitrary, ii) a Field's data array may not span all of the dimensions of its space (in CF-netCDF terms this would be the case if a data variable has as associated scalar coordinate variable) and iii) a Field may not even have a data array (in which case it serves just to define a space).
</p>
<p>
Also, a dimension may not even have an associated coordinate array, in which case I feel that DimensionCoordinate is not an appropiate name. For a dimension which does have a coordinate array, the dimension and the array have a 1-1 correspondence, and so need not be of different types.
</p>
<p>
I must admit to being confused by the name "ScalarField", as it can hold multidimensional data. I presume (?) that the name distinguishes it from a collection of one or more Fields, but I think that this is an implementation issue, and the atomic "Field" is more appropriate to the data model.
</p>
<p>
All the best,
</p>
<p>
David

I think that 'i' is not a major issue for a DimensionCoordinate, it merely puts the responsibility for managing the links between the Field and the DimensionCoordiantes firmly on the relevant relation.  This feels manageable to me.

<p>
I am not convinced by this.  I think the dimensionality of a field is the dimensionality of its data array dimensions, some of which may be length 1.  A scalar coordinate variable in a !NetCDF file is either a DimensionCoordiante or an AuxiliaryCoordiante, I do not think we have a ScalarCoordiante type.

<p>
A Field may increase its dimensionality by merging with another Field, length 1 DimensionCoordiantes may increase in size and length 1 AuxiliaryCoordinates may be transformed to DimensionCoordinates by this process.

<p>
Point 'iii' is particularly interesting, I am considering this one more. Is it really a valid Field if it has 'no data' as opposed to an array of missing data?

<p>
In this case, as in all others, I would suggest the dimension is an emergent property of the Field, not an entity in its own right.
</p>
<p>
I feel dimensions are an artifact of the !NetCDF encoding and not inherent to the CF data model.  Their names are arbitrary and used to provide relations in the file, I do not think they have any conceptual meaning, so I would not include them in the model.

Hello Jonathan

<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
<strong>abstract Coordinate type</strong>, of which dimension coordinates and auxiliary coordinates are particular cases. I don't think the CF standard implies this abstraction. It always talks of (Unidata) coordinate variables or auxiliary coordinate variables; when conventions apply to both, it mentions both. I agree of course that there is a similarity between these, and it's very likely it would be convenient to have an abstract class for it in software due to shared functionality, but you don't need this type to describe the CF standard or CF-netCDF data.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree that the CF standard always talks of (Unidata) coordinate variables or auxiliary coordinate variables but my view is that this is entirely consistent with the presence of an abstract type within the model.  I also view this abstract type as fulfiling a particular and useful function.
</p>
<p>
The fact that the CF Convention does not mention an abstract type is because it is an implementation and, as such, does not have a tangible encoding for this abstract construct.
</p>
<p>
I do not view this construct as 'convenient ... in software' but inherent to the concepts in CF, so I would like to see it in the data model.  I believe it fulfils the key purpose: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The abstract Coordinate type's primary purpose is to maintain the consistency between DimensionCoordinates and AuxiliaryCoordiantes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Implementations may choose whether or not to use this concept in some explicit but uninstantiated form or whether to bypass it and simply provide implementations of the tangible types; the latter being the approach taken by the CF conventions for !NetCDF files.
</p>
<p>
I think it is important that the model maintains this consistency, in part, to facilitate the type transformation of instances of DimensionCoordiantes and AuxiliaryCoordiantes; transformations in both directions are common for many datasets, I believe.  For example, <a class="new ticket" href="./78.html" title="enhancement: CF aggregation rules (new)">#78</a> aims to explicitly describe such processes.

I didn't mean to suggest that we need ScalarCoordinate type (I don't think we do) - I hoped merely to  create a CF-netCDF analogy to a particular sort of Field so people would know what I was on about!

Their names may be arbitrary, but the fact that they have identities and sizes is important and meaningful. The statement "This box on the table has 3 dimensions: height(size 10, going up) x width(size 20, going to my left) x length(size 30, going away from me)" sets the scene, I think, even though we don't  yet know anything more about the dimensions than how big they are and which is which. If we added "The height is in centimetres and is marked into ten equal sections" then we have merely added some metadata (i.e. an array and its units) to the fundamentals already laid down. Maybe the box contains one 20x30 flat piece of paper ... :)

<p>
Whilst Jonathan and I originally considered it, the aggregation rules of <a class="new ticket" href="./78.html" title="enhancement: CF aggregation rules (new)">#78</a> explicitly prohibit transforming dimension coordinates into auxiliary coordinates, and vice versa:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"<em>A pair of matching coordinate constructs is a coordinate construct from each field of the  same type (dimension or auxiliary) ...</em>"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
One reason for this being, if I recall, that these things have been defined as they for a reason, and so transforming them is unsafe.
</p>
<p>
If we agree that dimensions and auxiliary coordinates are different enough to need their own type, then in the spirit of a minimilist data model, a construct which has their shared behaviours but is otherwise unused is, perhaps, not required.

Sorry - scratch that bit. Dimenions unused by the data array must have size 1 (as opposed to size 10 in my example). Maybe that'll teach me to take an analogy too far!

<p>
I am with Mark on this.  Dimensions are not required distinct from their DimensionCoordinate.  Consider an alternative world where each NetCDF variable was defined on it's own set of dimensions (i.e. there was no concept of shared dimensions).  We could then relate a variable to it's coordinate values using attributes.  E.g.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">variables:
  double var1(time=100, lat=145, lon=192) ;
    var1:time_variable = 'time' ;
    var1:lat_variable = 'latitude' ;
    var:lon_variable = 'longitude' ;
  double time(t=100) ;
  double latitude(y=145) ;
  double longitude(x=192) ;
</pre><p>
In this case var1 is still related to coordinate axes time, latitude and longitude although there exists no distinct dimension concepts within the format.

<p>
This sounds like a fundamental dissagreement over what is the space of a Field.  Surely a 2-d slice is a Field in 2-d space.  If we want to describe how that 2-d space is embedded in a 3-d space that requires extra constructs.  Maybe a CellMeasure or something similar?  If this is already represented in Cf it isn't apparent to me.

<p>
In my view form needs to be considered relative to the meta-model we are using (either informally or formally).  In the end a model can be reduced to some underlying meta-model.  E.g. UML or set logic or the NetCDF abstract data model.  Maybe we need to reach concensus on what that meta-model is first?  I get the impression that John and David are working on a NetCDF meta-model -- that is not to say the actual encoding, but the concepts underneath: dimension, variable, attribute.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure what Mark's meta-model assumptions are yet.  I think the definitions at the top of the <a class="wiki" href="/trac/wiki/PotentialDataModelTypes">PotentialDataModelTypes</a> wiki page could be clarified in that regard but this is probably best left to another thread.

<p>
I am not convinced by this. I think the dimensionality of a field is the dimensionality of its data array dimensions, some of which may be length 1. A scalar coordinate variable in a !NetCDF file is either a DimensionCoordiante or an AuxiliaryCoordiante, I do not think we have a ScalarCoordiante type.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think that it's needlessly proscriptive to insist that a Field's data array spans all of its size 1 dimensions. Whether or not the data array spans them or not is arbitrary and so shouldn't be insisted upon. Conceptually, the idea of, say, a 2-d slice from a 3-d space (e.g. a surface air temperature field) is very natural and so should, I think, be expressible in the data model At the same time, it is just as reasonable to want to view this field in 3 dimensions, so that should, of course, be allowed, too.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This sounds like a fundamental dissagreement over what is the space of a Field.  Surely a 2-d slice is a Field in 2-d space.  If we want to describe how that 2-d space is embedded in a 3-d space that requires extra constructs.  Maybe a CellMeasure or something similar?  If this is already represented in Cf it isn't apparent to me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I wanted to chime in here about the idea of allowing a Field to be a slice of the total space. In <a class="ext-link" href="http://earthsystemmodeling.org"><span class="icon">​</span>ESMF</a> we allow an ESMF Field to be a subset of the total space defined by the associated ESMF Grid which defines its coordinates, dimension and distribution. We do this by allowing the user to specify a gridToFieldMap when the Field is created. The gridToFieldMap specifies which dimension of the Field each dimension of the Grid is associated with. Maybe something similar could be used here. For example, if you wanted to specify that a Field was a slice of another Field you could have an attribute (e.g. slice_map) which points to the Field and specifies which dimensions it maps to. 
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">variables:
  double fieldA(size1, size2, slze3) ;

   double slice_of_fieldA(size1,size3)
    slice_of_field:slice_map="field:1,3"
</pre><p>
 
However, you might want to know the index values in the other dimensions at which you're making the slice. For example. in the above what level of dimension 2 were you taking the 2D slice at to give you slice_of_fieldA? In that case you might want to make the map the length of all the dimensions of the field and use a symbol to indicate which dimensions are from the original field say '*' and put in the numbers to indicate the levels. 
</p>
<p>
For example, if slice_of_fieldA is at the 10 level of dimension 2 it would look like:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">variables:
  double fieldA(size1, size2, slze3) ;

   double slice_of_fieldA(size1,size3)
    slice_of_field:slice_map="field:*,10,*"
</pre><p>
It seems to me that an attribute which specifies a relationship between Fields like slice_map should be in the other properties components of the Field, since those are per Field, whereas I believe the CellMeasures are per data value in the Field.

Dear all
</p>
<p>
<strong>What we are doing</strong>. Stephen correctly says that the data model that David and I are proposing is not a description of the actual encoding in CF-netCDF, but tries to identify underlying concepts. It's an interpretation of CF-netCDF, and in principle it could be implemented in other file formats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Abstract coordinate type</strong>. I agree with Mark that an abstract coordinate type (of which Dimensions and AuxiliaryCoordinates are special cases) is consistent with the CF convention, but I agree with David that it is not required. As David says, our proposed model is a minimalist one, and since this construct is not necessary to describe CF metadata, it is not included. This minimalist approach is the same one as we use in the development of the CF-netCDF standard; we don't introduce ideas and mechanisms unless we have a definite need for them. Similarity of form is not a reason for introducing an abstract type. We have already discussed the point that the CellMeasure and AuxiliaryCoordinate constructs are similar in form, but they are distinct in function, and it would not be helpful to regard them as special cases of a more abstract construct in the <em>data model</em>, although it might well be sensible to <em>implement</em> them as subclasses of a general class.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Relation of Dimensions to Fields</strong>. CF-netCDF follows the Unidata convention of associating coordinate variable and data variables implicitly via the identity of dimensions:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
  double var1(time,lat,lon);
  double time(time) ;
  double lat(lat) ;
  double lon(lon) ;

</pre><p>
Stephen describes an alternative convention in which each netCDF variable is defined with its own set of dimensions:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
  double var1(time, lat, lon) ;
    var1:time_variable = 'time' ;
    var1:lat_variable = 'latitude' ;
    var1:lon_variable = 'longitude' ;
  double time(t) ;
  double latitude(y) ;
  double longitude(x) ;

</pre><p>
In this convention, <tt>time</tt> and <tt>t</tt> are numerically equal, and likewise <tt>lat</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, <tt>lon</tt> and <tt>x</tt>. This convention looks more complicated and involves redundancy, but I agree that it <em>could</em> be done this way, in which dimensions belong to their variables and there are explicit statements of how they are related. However, it's not CF! Our proposed data model describes a Dimension as being part of a Field because that seemed to us to be a good description of the CF-netCDF convention. The Dimension does not need to exist unless the Field exists. Similarly, the coordinate array does not need to exist unless the Dimension exists, so the coordinate array is part of our Dimension construct. It is optional part, however, because it possible to have a dimension of a data variable which does not have a 1D coordinate variable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2D slide of 3D Field</strong>. I would say that if a slice is taken of a 3D Field, we still have a 3D Field, but one of the Dimensions has been reduced to size 1. Like David, I would say that the Field still has this Dimension, even if we drop it from the data variable, which might now be 2D. This is consistent with the CF-netCDF standard, because the size-1 dimension might be deleted, and the size-1 coordinate variable replaced with a scalar coordinate variable (listed in the <tt>coordinates</tt> attribute). Our data model follows the CF-netCDF standard in regarding size-1 coordinate variables and scalar coordinate variables as equivalent. We think this implies that the data variable does not have to include the size-1 dimensions. An important reason why size-1 dimensions have this special status is that it makes no difference to the contents of the data array whether and where they are included in the list of dimensions; you can always change the shape of it by inserting or deleting size-1 dimensions at any position.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Field without data</strong>. We recognise this possibility in our proposed data model even though it is actually not possible in CF-netCDF, since it's the data variable which identifies the dimensions and scalar coordinate variables. However a Field without data, which we call a space (but we don't recognise this as a construct in the model), could be useful in applications, for instance you might use it to specify the grid you want to a regridding application.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for this interesting discussion. Cheers

<strong>Relation of Dimensions to Fields</strong>.  My example of the alternative dimension convention was intended to illustrate that it is possible to relate a variable to it's coordinate variables without the use of shared dimensions; thus supporting my case that dimension constructs are not inherent to the CF data model.  I agree the convention isn't as convenient as the way CF actually does it.  (As an aside it is quite close to the way it's represented in NetCDF4's HDF5 encoding where there isn't really shared dimensions).
</p>
<p>
<strong>2D slice of 3D Field</strong>.  If bounds are defined I can see how a slice would retain the same dimensionality as its source Field.  However, once you squash the unit dimension I don't see how this can be true.  I read jonathan's point as saying a slice <em>F1</em> of shape [1,80,160] taken from a Field <em>F2</em> of shape [200,80,160] is equivalent to the same slice with the first dimension squashed, say slice <em>F3</em> of shape [80,160], and both <em>F1</em> and <em>F3</em> are 3D Fields (i.e. rank=3).  It appears <em>F3</em> somehow remembers the rank of the original field <em>F2</em>.

Dear Stephen
</p>
<p>
<strong>Relation of Dimensions to Fields</strong>. This is intriguing but I suspect I haven't grasped your point yet. I agree that it is <em>possible</em> to relate a data variable to its coordinate variables without the use of shared dimensions. However the way it is done in HDF and the netCDF method you suggested are not how it is done in CF, as you say. Therefore I don't think these implementations tell us about the CF data model. The CF data model is an abstraction of how CF-netCDF describes data. In my interpretation, the data variable is central to CF-netCDF, and correspondingly we have the Field as the central concept in the data model. In CF-netCDF, the data variable has netCDF dimensions; thus in the data model the Field construct contains Dimension constructs.
</p>
<p>
The question we were discussing with Mark was where the information about the size of the dimensions resides. David and I think that the size of a dimension is the property of a Dimension, not the property of a Field. Thus, a Field has certain Dimensions, and each of these Dimensions has a size. Take your array of shape (200,80,160). I would say that this array has three dimensions, its first dimension has a size of 200, and this dimension could also have a coordinate array (which must have size 200 because it belongs to this dimension). To me this seems a more natural model of the data than the alternative of saying that there exists a data array whose first dimension has size 200, and there exists a coordinate array of size 200, and there is a mechanism which explicitly records that these are related. This is less natural because the coordinate array would not be required at all if the data array did not exist or did not have this dimension.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2D slide of 3D field</strong>. When you take a slice of shape (1,80,160) from a Field of shape (200,80,160) you do not delete the first dimension of the space, but you <em>can</em> delete the first dimension of the data array. The data array can be squashed to (80,160) without changing its contents. For example, suppose the 3D field is (pressure,lat,lon), and suppose we take the single level at pressure=500 mbar. The pressure dimension now has size one. There is a size-1 coordinate variable of 500 mbar. In CF-netCDF there are two alternative and equivalent ways to encode this:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
  pressure=1; // dimension
  float temperature(pressure,lat,lon);
  float pressure(pressure);
  float lat(lat);
  float lon(lon);

  float temperature(lat,lon);
    temperature:coordinates="pressure";
  float pressure; // scalar coordinate variable
  float lat(lat);
  float lon(lon);

</pre><p>
I argue that, in the data model, the Field has a pressure Dimension in both cases, with size 1, and with a coordinate value. However the data array does not need this size-1 dimension. As a further step, you could explicitly <em>delete</em> the size-1 pressure dimension. Then the Field is reduced to 2D.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What we are doing</strong>. Constructing the data model is a sort of reverse engineering. The object code is the CF convention. The source code, which we are trying to reconstruct, is the abstract ideas that motivated the convention. However, this process is not really a reconstruction, but a construction, since the data model was not previously defined. In fact, the authors of the convention may have had slightly different ideas in mind. So long as those different ideas didn't lead to different agreed conventions, the data model was truly agnostic about the choices involved. We could decide now on a particular interpretation of CF in unclear cases, but we don't have to. If we really can't decide what CF means on a particular issue, it may be wiser to leave it undefined until a new proposal for changing the conventions makes a decision more necessary.
</p>

Best wishes

In my view the way NetCDF dimensions are shared between variables is "a mechanism which explicitly records that [variable dimensions] are related" .   I think the disagreement over where dimension-size resides indicates there is redundancy in the proposed model.  Eg. we can say

<ol><li>The size of a Field's dimension is the length of it's associated coordinate variable array
</li><li>Two Fields share a dimension if they are associated with the same coordinate variable

Neither of these statements rely on the existence of a separate dimension construct.

Perhaps we should try to answer this question first:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Is a coordinate array mandatory for every dimension of the field's space?</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think that the answer is 'no', i.e. a dimension of the field might be defined purely in index-space. In this case I don't think that the dimension is a coordinate (because index-space has no physical meaning) yet the field still needs to know the size of the dimension.
</p>
<p>
As I understand it, the current CF conventions do not force every dimension to have a coordinate array. <a class="ext-link" href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.6/cf-conventions.html#geographic-regions"><span class="icon">​</span>Section 6.1.1 Geographic Regions</a> is an example of this. In this example the dimension does, as it happens, have a 1-d auxiliary <tt>region</tt> coordinate associated with it, but the auxiliary coordinate does not fulfil the 'coordinate array for the dimension' role.

All the best,

<p>
That's quite right, and in CF 1.6 (our data model is for 1.5) this possibility has been made explicit in the new section 4.5 <em>Discrete Axis</em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The spatiotemporal coordinates described in sections 4.1-4.4 are continuous variables, and other geophysical quantities may likewise serve as continuous coordinate variables, for instance density, temperature or radiation wavelength. By contrast, for some purposes there is a need for an axis of a data variable which indicates either an ordered list or an unordered collection, and does not correspond to any continuous coordinate variable. Consequently such an axis may be called “discrete”. A discrete axis has a dimension but might not have a coordinate variable. Instead, there might be one or more auxiliary coordinate variables with this dimension (see preamble to section 5). Following sections define various applications of discrete axes, for instance section 6.1.1 “Geographical regions”, section 7.3.3 “Statistics applying to portions of cells”, section 9.3 “Representation of collections of features in data variables”.

In <a class="ext-link" href="http://earthsystemmodeling.org"><span class="icon">​</span>ESMF</a> we allow an ESMF Field to be a subset of the total space defined by the associated ESMF Grid which defines its coordinates, dimension and distribution. We do this by allowing the user to specify a gridToFieldMap when the Field is created. The gridToFieldMap specifies which dimension of the Field each dimension of the Grid is associated with. Maybe something similar could be used here. For example, if you wanted to specify that a Field was a slice of another Field you could have an attribute (e.g. slice_map) which points to the Field and specifies which dimensions it maps to.

<p>
This is an interesting concept, which seems to me to be providing a mechanism for many datasets to share the same collection of coordinates.  This additional capability enables this sharing to occur in cases where one dataset is a coherent subset of another. 
</p>
<p>
However, the wording of the CF Conventions strongly imply that each data variable is an independent entity, and that sharing of coordinates is an encoding artifact, with no semantic meaning.  the description of how global variables may be overridden individually by data variables is one example of this perspective.
</p>
<p>
As such, I don't think this concept is consistent with the CF model.  I like the advantages that come of mandating that each Field must be a self contained, self describing instance.  
</p>
<p>
It is then the metadata which must be used to compare and relate variables, not interrelated characteristics, like subsetted dimensions; this feels more interoperable to me.
</p>
<p>
Whilst I can see it's use in a number of implementation cases, I think it is implementation specific; I don't support this approach for the CF data model.

On the <strong>Relation of Dimensions to Fields</strong>: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I think that dimensions are properties of Fields, I do not think that they have an identity or any explicit independent characteristics.  As such, I do not think that the 'Dimension' construct is a useful concept for the data model, in fact I think it is somewhat confusing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
I would rather see a Field with emergent properties of 'dimensionality' and 'shape' derived from the data of the Field.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is no controlled terminology for dimension naming in the CF Conventions and no semantics implied by dimension constructs in CF !NetCDF files.  I suggest this supports my perspective. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Where a dimension of a Field has a one dimensional numerical monatonic coordinate related to that dimension, this coordinate may have a special type, indicating it as the primary characterisation mechanism for the dimension, with a Field constraint that each dimension may only have one or zero of these DimensionCoordinate instances per dimension.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
I believe that this perspective minimally captures the semantics of the CF conventions for !NetCDF files whilst preserving the implementation agnostic nature of the data model.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
I also do not believe the data model should support data free Fields, unless there is a strong justification to do so; as pointed out, these are not able to be encoded as CF !NetCDF Files (although a 'missing data Field' is).

You could use it to share coordinates as you describe, but I was thinking of it more as useful metadata for describing the relation ship between two Fields when one is a slice of the other. From the previous discussion it looks like when you take a slice of Field you lose the information about what level you took the slice at. Maybe there's an existing CF way of indicating this that I haven't seen? Though, I guess this is probably drifting away from the topic at hand.
</p>
<p>
I agree that dimensions in CF are probably best represented as properties of Fields, rather than independent entities. The 'dimension' construct is useful, but since the goal is to capture CF conventions as closely as possible without added entities it seems unnecessary.

What is a slice of a 3D Field?
</p>
<p>
When the cell bounds have extent in the reduced dimension, its probably more natural to consider it a reduced 3D field. If no extent (eg a point sample) then 2D might be more natural. 
</p>
<p>
If you think of it as a 2D field, in the language of topology, its a "2D manifold embedded in a 3D space". This is especially useful when you think of it as a sampling of a continuous function, and/or you visualize it in coordinate space.

I think John's approach of expressing the CF-model in mathematical terms is the only way we are going to get a clear data model.  I'm definitely not quibbling with the existence of dimensions when expressed in these terms.  The advantage of mathematical terminology is that it avoids potentially ambiguous terms such as "contains", "is related to".  Thanks John!
</p>
<p>
I may have miss-understood but I think John introduces several concepts that were thus far absent from Jonathan's and/or Mark's approaches:
</p>
<ol><li>A variable as a continuous function that is sampled
</li><li>A Coordinate System as the domain of a Field (maybe this is Jonathan's Transform?)

Not sure about this.  The basis for a subset of the domain can be specified by a Coordiante System referenced by DimensionCoordiantes, but this is all optional.  Many of the dimensions of the Field are not in any way related to a Coordiante System, such as ones representing time, ensemble etc.

<p>
I think that this case is handled in CF by the 2D slice Field still having a coordinate of some type, with a single value, but all the same coordinate metadata as the equivalent coordinate on the 3D Field.
</p>
<p>
Thus I can access the information that the 2D slice Field is a subset of the 3D Field by comparing the coordinates, finding the ones which match metadata and identifying that the value in the 2D Field's coordinate is one of the values existing in the 3D Field's coordinate.  If this is a DimensionCoordinate or equivalent then this also provides me with the index value the slice was taken across.

As far as I can recall, these are the only points where there is lack of concensus, but please forgive and correct me if I've overlooked some previous points, or, indeed if you don't agree that with my reduction. Three items are of interest:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> Should there be a Dimension construct?
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong> Should data-free Fields which just describe a space be allowed?
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>3.</strong> The independence of Fields
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Item <strong>1.</strong> is revolving around the questions "<em>is a coordinate array mandatory for every dimension of the field's space?</em>" and "<em>what is the nature of a dimension if it has no coordinate array?</em>" 
</p>
<p>
Item <strong>2.</strong> is focusing on whether or not such an entity is allowable in CF, and whether or not such an entity should be possible within the confines of the data model. The second question links back to item <strong>1.</strong> in that such a possibility is highly dependent on how the dimensions are constructed.
</p>
<p>
I propose that item <strong>3.</strong> is a diversion, as Bob suggests. The sharing of Field components is an application dependent optimization which should not be part of the data model.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps, all the best,
</p>

<p>
Hello,
</p>
<p>
I'd like to follow up on these points with some ideas and examples that Jonathan and I have been discussing.
</p>
<p>
Given that a coordinate array is not mandatory for a dimension of the field's space (are we all happy with this?), and presuming that "emergent property" means "inferable from other aspects of the field", then I ask:
 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How can a Dimension be an emergent property
of the field in the acceptable case that there is a size one dimension
with no coordinate array which is not spanned by the data array?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I say that the answer is that it can't. Therefore the Dimension has to be component of the field in its own right, and the dimension size is the only thing which <em>must</em> exist about the Dimension.
</p>
<p>
Another example is inspired by John's swath case:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How can a Dimension
be an emergent property of the field in the acceptable case that the data
array has two equally sized dimensions, both of which do not have coordinate
arrays, but are spanned by a 2-d auxiliary coordinate?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is more likely than the first example, as it is quite possible
you might not bother to create eastings and northings 1-d coords, but still wish
(indeed, you are required) to supply 2D lat and lon auxiliary coords.John comments in the swath example "Note that there is not a 1-1 correspondence of coordinate and dimension", which is true as well as being a perfectly reasonable use case.
</p>
<p>
We think that the idea of a data-free field which just describes a space is a natural one given our view on item <strong>1.</strong>. Note that a space is <em>not</em> a construct of our data model. It is natural because everything you need to define it is not dependent on the field's data array. So, whilst such a thing is not explicit in CF1.5, we feel it does no harm! Also a new need for it can be foreseen in CF1.6 section 9. In the discussions (though not yet in sect 9) the possibility was raised of a kind of feature which described location only e.g. the position
of a front on a meteorological chart, with no data.
</p>
<p>
On a terminology point, Mark's coordinate system is not, as I understand it, the same as the field's space. Mark's kind of coordinate system is a selection of dimensions and coordinates that one might make from the complete set that define the space, for a particular purpose like a grid mapping.
</p>
<p>
All the best,
</p>
<p>
David

<p>
I disagree. Capturing which fields are on a shared domain seems an important role for the CF data model. While comparing the coordinates of two fields to see if they are the same (both coordinate values and other information/attributes about the coordinate) is possible, finding some methods to capture information about shared domains seems preferable. Also, that comparison isn't possible for a coordinate in index space.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure how to capture this in the data model. But in the netCDF-CF encoding, using shared dimensions to indicate a shared domain is a very simple and, it turns out, quite powerful construct. For simple cases, shared dimensions and netCDF coordinate variables are enough to map index space into coordinate space. In more complex situations (e.g., the swath case that John mentions above) you need more explicit information, (e.g., "data:coordiantes='lat lon'", again from John's example). But even there the shared dimensions can be seen as a shared index space.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, that's my $0.02.

These are general observations on Dimensions, which may shed some light on "dimensions without coordinates".
</p>
<p>
1) In the netcdf data model, all we have are multidimensional arrays, all dimensions are global objects, and one can only define variables using global dimensions. These syntactic elements have to be used for everything. The obvious example of the limitation of this is having to use global dimensions for char variables, since netcdf-3 doesnt have strings:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">  dimensions:
    var_strlen = 56;
  variables:
    char var(var_strlen);
</pre><p>
really could be an unnamed "anonymous" dimension:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">  variables:
    char var(56);
</pre><p>
although better is to have a variable length object, as in netcdf-4:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">  variables:
    string var;
</pre><p>
  
</p>
<p>
2) In particular, dimensions are sometimes used as part of the domain, and sometimes as part of the range, when thinking about variables as sampled functions. For example:
</p>
<pre class="wiki"> dimensions:
  time = UNLIMITED;
  vec  = 3;
 variables:
  float wind(time, vec);
</pre><p>
probably represents a function whose domain is time and range is a 3-vector, but one cant tell that off-hand. Sometimes you can tell by examining the coordinates, but really its a "you just have to know" kind of thing.
</p>
<p>
(However, in this example, its not a bad idea to add a nominal coordinate variable for the vec dimension, eg {"x","y","z"} or whatever. Also, we might advise to split it into 3 separate variables).
</p>
<p>
The point is, different intentions for how a dimension is used to define the multidimensionsal variable can be confusing; you may have to disambiguate them for a precise data model.
</p>
<ol start="3"><li>Coordinates are completely general for all types of scientific data. But what CF has done over the years is to define a very elegant set of Conventions that both define general coordinate systems, and specialize netcdf for earth science data. Besides standard names, most of the specialization comes from handling space and time coordinates. So, IMO the important use cases are defining georeferencing coordinate systems for actual scientific data.

Not sure about this.  The basis for a subset of the domain can be specified by a Coordiante System referenced by DimensionCoordiantes, but this is all optional.  Many of the dimensions of the Field are not in any way related to a Coordiante System, such as ones representing time, ensemble etc.

<p>
In my understanding, the number of Dimensions is the dimensionality of the Field's domain, and the number of coordinates is the dimensionality of the space that the field is embedded in. 
</p>
<p>
Eg a satellite image might have 2 Dimensions (and so be a 2D image), but it might have 3 coordinates, say, x,y, and z, which describes the 3 dimensional space the image is embedded in.

<p>
Very important to distinguish those two dimensionalities!

<p>
Consistency is key, so a mechanism is required to to match the coordinates to the field, but I don't think this yet tells us which mechanism must be used.

<p>
I don't think this is consistent with the CF conventions.  I think that a Field defines a set of sampling points for 1 physical value.  I don't think any Fields share coordiantes or dimensions.
</p>
<p>
Two fields can be compared to see if their coordinates and dimensions are the same, but they are not shared.
</p>

<p>
I guess if they are the same, then they are shared. In a UML diagram, you would/could show these as shared.

we'll happily work on that, the ideas are of great interest

in your example:

Consider the canonical swath dataset:

    float data(xscan,scan);

        data:coordinates = "lat lon";

    float lat(xscan, scan); float lon(xscan, scan);
</pre><p>
are 'scan' and 'xscan' crucial pieces of information?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
yes, very crucial. let me give an example if you didnt have them:
</p>
<p>
suppose some idiot flipped dimensions:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">float data(lat,lon);
  data:coordinates = "lat lon";
float lat(lon,lat);
float lon(lon,lat);
</pre><p>
now look at it without dimensions:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">float data(1000,1000);
  data:coordinates = "lat lon";
float lat(1000,1000);
float lon(1000,1000);
</pre><p>
so, the shared dimensions are the way we correctly match indices between fields and coordinates, and between fields and fields.

I disagree with this part of the proposed CF data model:
</p>
<p>
<em>"Data variables stored in CF-netCDF files are often not independent, because they share coordinate variables. However, we view this solely as a means of saving disk space, and we assume that software will be able to alter any field construct in memory without affecting other field constructs. For instance, if the coordinates of one field construct are modified, it will not affect any other field construct. Explicit tests of equality will be required to establish whether two data variables have the same coordinates. Such tests are necessary in general if CF is applied to a dataset comprising more than one file, because different variables may then reside in different files, with their own coordinate variables."</em>
</p>
<p>
As i interpret it, the current situation is that if two variables have the same list of coordinates, then they have the same coordinate system. This is not a convenience to save space, its a fundamental property of the dataset. Not sure why you'd throw that away and require software to figure it out again?
</p>
<p>
We do need special mechanisms to handle datasets that span files, but thats not a good reason to restrict the data model to independent fields. The data model is the abstraction we want to create encodings for. So what is the best abstraction?

One cant figure out everything from the syntax, so the answer is maybe.

If all the dimensions of length 1 have coordinate variables, and are removed and replaced by scalar coordinate variables, then those are equivalent in their semantics.

<p>
The answer to this question must be No, they do not have the same shape. However, CF-netCDF has two mechanisms for recording size-one coordinates, as you know. One of them uses a size-one netCDF dimension of the data array, with a coordinate variable having that dimension; the other is a CF-netCDF scalar coordinate variable, which is dimensionless and is named by the <tt>coordinates</tt> attribute of the data variable but does not appear in the list of dimensions. CF section 5.7 says "Scalar coordinate variables have the same information content and can be used in the same contexts as a size one coordinate variable."
</p>
<p>
In our proposed CF data model, David and I interpret this as meaning that size-one coordinate variables and scalar coordinate variables are logically equivalent. We therefore say "In this data model, a CF-netCDF scalar coordinate variable is regarded as a dimension construct with a size of unity." That means there can be Dimensions of the Field which do not appear as dimensions of the data array. I think this is the same as John said in an earlier entry; the dimensionality of the Field is not necessarily the same as the dimensionality of the data array. However, it is only size-one dimensions which are optional for the data array. They can have this special status, of course, because it does not make any difference to the order of the elements of the array whether and where size-one dimensions are included in the list of dimensions.
</p>
<p>
I think this is a different question from the one about whether there can be Dimensions without coordinate values, isn't it? David and I think the answer to this other question is Yes. The CF standard explicitly provides such constructs (in CF 1.6 section 4.5), and David gave above the example of 2D latitude and longitude aux coord variables whose 1D dimensions do not have coordinate variables.

I disagree with this part of the proposed CF data model:
</p>
<p>
<em>"Data variables stored in CF-netCDF files are often not independent, because they share coordinate variables. However, we view this solely as a means of saving disk space, and we assume that software will be able to alter any field construct in memory without affecting other field constructs. For instance, if the coordinates of one field construct are modified, it will not affect any other field construct. Explicit tests of equality will be required to establish whether two data variables have the same coordinates. Such tests are necessary in general if CF is applied to a dataset comprising more than one file, because different variables may then reside in different files, with their own coordinate variables."</em>
</p>
<p>
As i interpret it, the current situation is that if two variables have the same list of coordinates, then they have the same coordinate system. This is not a convenience to save space, its a fundamental property of the dataset. Not sure why you'd throw that away and require software to figure it out again?
</p>
<p>
We do need special mechanisms to handle datasets that span files, but thats not a good reason to restrict the data model to independent fields. The data model is the abstraction we want to create encodings for. So what is the best abstraction?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It seems that David and I disagree with you and Ethan about this, as regards the CF data model. We agree with you, of course, that in a CF-netCDF dataset if two data variables have the same list of dimensions they must have the same coordinate space. But we do not think that sharing the dimensions should give them a special status.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we were not correct to say that this is <em>solely</em> a means of saving disk space. We would agree that it is a natural thing to do in a CF-netCDF file. However, what is done in a CF-netCDF file isn't necessarily the best abstraction. I would say there are several reasons why we should regard Fields as logically independent, even if they share dimensions:
</p>
<ol><li>The CF standard is focussed on the data variable, which is the central part of a Field construct. Everything relates to the data variable. There are few parts of the CF standard which talk about relationships between data variables. I don't think there is any statement in the CF standard which recognises a special relationship between data variables which share their coordinate spaces.
</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>As you say above, we need mechanisms to handle the relationship between data variables in different files, when they cannot share coordinates. Although CF-netCDF is a convention for single netCDF files at the moment, I think we all recognise this isn't really adequate, and in the data model we should allow for the requirement for datasets to span many files. A good example is the CMIP5 datasets. In these there are many Fields with dimensions (time,lat,lon) spanning many files covering different ranges of times. Software that processes these datasets should regard them as being in the same (lat,lon) space even though they are not in the same netCDF files.
</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Moreover, even within a single CF-netCDF file you might have, for instance, two latitude coordinate variables that were actually equal e.g. dimensions <tt>lat1=180</tt> and <tt>lat2=180</tt> with the same 1D coordinate variable of 180 values. That's not the best way to write a file, but it could happen; one way it might happen is if the contents of the file had been assembled from two different sources of data. I don't want to regard data variables which use <tt>lat1</tt> as sharing the same grid while data variables that use <tt>lat2</tt> are on a different grid. I think that software which followed that model would be rather inconvenient. I would like my analysis software to <em>test</em> whether two Fields have the same grid when I ask it to do something with them, like compare them or add them. The analysis software can save itself time in this comparison, as a shortcut, by noticing if they use the same coordinate variables in a CF-netCDF file, but if they don't, it should compare the dimensions and coordinate variables, which will inevitably take a bit longer.
</li></ol><ol start="4"><li>We would like the CF data model also to apply to data which is not CF-netCDF. It should apply, in particular, to data which is being served as though it were netCDF but is actually being obtained from data in some other format. If it's not coming from netCDF files, the convention of shared coordinate variables may not apply to it.
</li></ol><p>

My last posting (late last night!) ended rather abruptly! To summarise: I agree that in a CF-netCDF file there is a natural association and a special status for data variables which share coordinate variables. However, I feel that in the CF data model we should take a more general approach which doesn't rely on the variables concerned being stored in a single netCDF file. This requires that the relationship, of sharing the coordinate space, has to be recognised just as readily between data variables that do not share files or coordinate variables in the data source that they come from. The most economical way of doing this, I think, is to regard Fields as independent, and to test whether their coordinates, or a subset of their coordinates, are equal, when it is relevant to do so in processing or analysing the data. When they <em>do</em> share coordinate variables, it is particularly easy to recognise that the coordinates are equal. I also feel that the idea of independent data variables is a reasonable interpretation of the CF standard as a whole, in which data variables are generally seen as independently self-describing.

<p>
I hope that's better ... what do you think?

We think that the idea of a data-free field which just describes a space is a natural one given our view on item <strong>1.</strong>. Note that a space is <em>not</em> a construct of our data model. It is natural because everything you need to define it is not dependent on the field's data array. So, whilst such a thing is not explicit in CF1.5, we feel it does no harm! Also a new need for it can be foreseen in CF1.6 section 9. In the discussions (though not yet in sect 9) the possibility was raised of a kind of feature which described location only e.g. the position
of a front on a meteorological chart, with no data.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sorry to respond to this older item, but I just wanted to say that I think it would definitely be a good idea to allow data free Fields which serve to describe a space. Our (ESMF) regrid application allows the user to generate regridding weights between grids defined in files. If it is possible to define these grids without associated data fields in CF it would certainly be more efficient than always having to have an associated data variable. We currently support the version 1.6 GRIDSPEC and upcoming UGrid formats, so this is probably more applicable for the data model for that version of CF. However, if it's allowable within CF 1.5 it would be good to have it in that data model as well both for regridding and also for consistency's sake.

I think there is another interpretation, consistent with the Conventions:
</p>

<p>
The dimensionality and extent of the Field's data defines the domain and sampling of the Field in index space.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
All Coords map to dimensions of the Field's data, further defining the domain and sampling of the Field. Consistency of shape (dimensionality and extent) is required for valid mappings.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
A Field may define one Coordinate for each of it's dimensions which explicitly defines that dimension.   
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This feels to me like a less complex model than the definition of a Dimension construct. 
</p>
<p>
The consistency and differences between the two types of Coord are explicitly defined as is the Role of the Field in defining a Coord as a DimensionCoordinate.  I think this encapsulates information with the correct types in a consistent manner.
</p>
<p>
I have update <a class="wiki" href="/trac/wiki/PotentialDataModelTypes">PotentialDataModelTypes</a> to better reflect this interpretation.

A further thought: I do not think that the interpretation I posted (<a class="ticket" href="./68#comment:70" title="Comment 70">markh</a>) prevents an implementation from providing a Field without data.  I'm not convinced this is a requirement for the model, but it has been viewed as a positive feature for some implementations in comments.
</p>
<p>
In general, an implementation may provide features whilst implementing the model consistently.  
</p>
<p>
For example, a Field's data array could be implemented to allow a 'Null Array', which has dimensionality, extent and order properties but does not define values for any array location.  This is distinct from an array of 'missing data'.
</p>
<p>
In this way an implementation may deliver a 'data free' Field.
</p>
<p>
Our primary implementation (!NetCDF) does not support this feature, as far as I understand but other implementations may be able to.

Dear Mark
</p>
<p>
In your model, how is a scalar coordinate variable interpreted? It does not correspond to a dimension of the data array.
</p>
<p>
Here's a CF-netCDF example:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">  dimensions:
    lon=96;
    lat=72;
  variables:
    float precipitation(lat,lon);
      precipitation:standard_name="precipitation_flux";
      precipitation:units="kg m-2 s-1";
      precipitation:coordinates="time";
    float time; // scalar coordinate variable
      time:units="days since 2012-10-1";
      time:standard_name="time";
    float lat(lat);
      lat:units="degrees_north";
      lat:standard_name="latitude";
    float lon(lon);
      lon:units="degrees_east";
      lon:standard_name="longitude";
</pre><p>
In the data model David and I proposed, this would be interpreted as follows:
</p>
<ul><li>The Field has
<ul><li>Dimensions time, lat and lon.
</li><li>a data array dimensioned (lat,lon).
</li><li>a standard_name property and a units property.
</li></ul></li><li>The time Dimension has
<ul><li>size 1.
</li><li>a data array of this size.
</li><li>a standard_name property and a units property.
</li></ul></li><li>The lat Dimension has
<ul><li>size 72.
</li><li>a data array of this size.
</li><li>a standard_name property and a units property.
</li></ul></li><li>The lon Dimension has
<ul><li>size 96.
</li><li>a data array of this size.
</li><li>a standard_name property and a units property.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
Note that the Dimension construct contains the dimension coordinate array.
</p>
<p>
If the CF-netCDF file contained a dimension <tt>time=1</tt>, coordinate variable <tt>time(time)</tt> and data variable <tt>precipitation(time,lat,lon)</tt>, the data array of the Field would also be dimensioned (time,lat,lon), but nothing else would be different.

My last posting (late last night!) ended rather abruptly! To summarise: I agree that in a CF-netCDF file there is a natural association and a special status for data variables which share coordinate variables. However, I feel that in the CF data model we should take a more general approach which doesn't rely on the variables concerned being stored in a single netCDF file. This requires that the relationship, of sharing the coordinate space, has to be recognised just as readily between data variables that do not share files or coordinate variables in the data source that they come from. The most economical way of doing this, I think, is to regard Fields as independent, and to test whether their coordinates, or a subset of their coordinates, are equal, when it is relevant to do so in processing or analysing the data. When they <em>do</em> share coordinate variables, it is particularly easy to recognise that the coordinates are equal. I also feel that the idea of independent data variables is a reasonable interpretation of the CF standard as a whole, in which data variables are generally seen as independently self-describing.
</p>
<p>
I hope that's better ... what do you think?

Hi Jonathan:
</p>
<p>
Maybe another way to look at it is: should the CF data model have a way to indicate that two fields share the same domain/sampling/coordinate system? If so, then one can say that, for two fields, if all of their coordinate variables match, then they have the same coordinate system. One can tell if they match either because the coordinate variables are the same, or because their values and metadata are identical.
</p>
<p>
Would that work?

Dear Mark
</p>
<p>
In your model, how is a scalar coordinate variable interpreted? It does not correspond to a dimension of the data array.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hello Jonathan
</p>
<p>
Using the types I have advocated, I would specify you example as:
</p>
<ul><li>Field:
<ul><li>standard_name="precipitation_flux"
</li><li>units="kg m-2 s-1"
</li><li>data = arr(shape(72,96))
</li><li>DimCoords = 
<ul><li>dim0 -&gt; Coordinate:
<ul><li>units="degrees_east"
</li><li>standard_name="longitude"
</li><li>points=arr(shape(96))
</li></ul></li><li>dim1 -&gt; Coordinate:
<ul><li>units="degrees_north"
</li><li>standard_name="latitude"
</li><li>points=arr(shape(72))
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>AuxCoords = 
<ul><li>[none] -&gt; Coordinate:
<ul><li>units="days since 2012-10-1"
</li><li>standard_name="time"
</li><li>points = arr(shape(1,))
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>
In this case the CF !NetCDF Scalar Coordinate Variable is interpreted as an instance of a  Coordinate type, meeting the constraints for that type.  It is referenced by the Field via [none] dimensions, as there are no Field dimensions for it to map to.

Yes! I think so. It would be a good idea for us to include in the data model a statement of rules to determine whether the spaces are the same for two data variables. By <em>space</em> David and I mean everything about the Field except its data and the properties of the data, so actually that's not just coordinates but also, for instance, CellMeasures. For example, I would not want to add two Fields together if they had different cell areas arrays, even if their coordinates were the same. Would you agree?
</p>
<p>
The rules for equivalence of spaces would probably be similar to, but simpler than, the rules for whether Fields can be aggregated. (We proposed some rules for that in ticket 78 and an <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~david/cf_aggregation_rules.html"><span class="icon">​</span>accompanying document</a>. However, aggregation is not part of the data model; it's something you can do with the Fields which the data model describes.

<p>
Are you thinking about the rules to determine if two <strong>field</strong>s share the same <strong>space</strong> as an implementation detail? For instance,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"A client must check &lt;<tt>some conditions</tt>&gt; to determine if two <strong>field</strong>s exist in the same coordinate reference system with the same extent, sampling, etc. (and thus can be directly compared)."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or as something that is explicitly captured in the abstract data model and can be mapped to by encodings of the CF data model? For instance, the data model might say something like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Two <strong>field</strong>s that reference the same <strong>space</strong> exist in the same coordinate reference system with the same extent, sampling, etc. (and thus can be directly compared)."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
and, building on that, the CF netCDF encoding might give a few mappings:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Data variables that share the same (auxiliary) coordinate variables can be mapped to <strong>field</strong>s that reference the same <strong>space</strong>."
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Multiple data variables that have identical coordinate variables can be mapped to <strong>field</strong>s that reference the same <strong>space</strong>."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I guess one problem with capturing all this in the data model is that the notion of a <strong>space</strong> would have to get more complicated to capture the case where multiple variables are on the same X and Y coordinates but have different Z coordinates (e.g., temperature on pressure levels vs on sigma levels).

<p>
This would be very useful for us (<a class="ext-link" href="http://earthsystemmodeling.org"><span class="icon">​</span>ESMF</a>) as well. It would help us to determine when a regrid matrix computed for one Field could be applied to another Field saving the cost of the computing the matrix again. When reading in and creating Fields within ESMF it would also help us to determine when two Fields could be created pointing to the same grid saving the cost of creating another grid unnecessarily. 
</p>
<p>
I also agree about having the CellMeasures match, variables like cell area would affect certain kinds of regridding (like conservative), and so would determine if a matrix could be shared.

A further thought: I do not think that the interpretation I posted (<a class="ticket" href="./68#comment:70" title="Comment 70">markh</a>) prevents an implementation from providing a Field without data.  I'm not convinced this is a requirement for the model, but it has been viewed as a positive feature for some implementations in comments.
</p>
<p>
In general, an implementation may provide features whilst implementing the model consistently.  
</p>
<p>
For example, a Field's data array could be implemented to allow a 'Null Array', which has dimensionality, extent and order properties but does not define values for any array location.  This is distinct from an array of 'missing data'.
</p>
<p>
In this way an implementation may deliver a 'data free' Field.
</p>
<p>
Our primary implementation (!NetCDF) does not support this feature, as far as I understand but other implementations may be able to.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To express a space without a data field you could use just a scalar variable and associate coordinates with it (similar to how the UGrid work defines a mesh). Like:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">double space;
  space:coordinates = "LAT LON" ;

double lat(num_lat);
double lon(num_lon);
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
However, maybe you could consider this just an implementation detail in NETCDF and in this case use the dimensions of the coord arrays as the sizes of the Fields in the data models???

<p>
I am a little wary of including just the rules for equality of space in the data model, because it is just one of a number of different types of commonly used consistency that we might be interested in between two spaces. All or None, I say. Four I can think of:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Equality</strong> (Are two spaces equal in every aspect?)
</li><li><strong>Aggregatability</strong> (Can two spaces be joined to form a larger space)
</li><li><strong>Combinability</strong> (Do the spaces of two fields allow them to be combined (e.g. added) 
</li><li><strong>Assignability</strong> (Does the space of one field allow its data to be assigned to a subspace of a larger field)
</li></ul><p>
The last two need to support the notion of <em>broadcasting</em>, each in different ways. For example, we might want to subtract a 3-d field with a size 1 height from each level of a multilevel 3-d field, or assign a 2-d sea surface temperature (SST) field spanning the Nino-3 region of the Pacific to each global SST field in a timeseries.
</p>
<p>
All the best,

Hello John
</p>
<p>
I think a useful abstraction of CF 1.5 data variables in !NetCDF files is to unpack each of the data variables, as Fields, with all of the referenced metadata provided to each one of the Fields.  This involves conceptually copying instances of coordinate variables etc. to each of the Fields individually.
</p>
<p>
This is clearly possible from a file and I think it is the most general approach. 
</p>
<p>
I would consider sharing of coordinate variables, or any other metadata instances, in !NetCDF files as a specialisation of a general concept, that if two instances of a type are equal by inspection, they are conceptually equivalent.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Identification of equivalent metadata instances may always be achieved by inspection and evaluation of equality.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I can look at any two coordinates, inspect their definitions and values, and identify that they are the same.  Once I have done this I can choose to implement a representation which uses a singleton for these two coordinates.
</p>
<p>
I can treat this as a mechanism only, with no conceptual sharing, such that any change made by one 'owner' first makes a copy, then changes its own copy. 
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, I can choose to state that the metadata instance is truly shared, one instance between many owners.  However, by choosing to do this, I have added another conceptual constraint: if any metadata is changed, it is changed for all of the Fields which share it, their coherence is preserved. Put another way, operations must always operate on the whole coherent set, not individual members.
</p>
<p>
I do not think this constraint should always be applied, as in many cases the CF !NetCDF file creator has utilised this mechanism as a storage optimisation, with no implied connectivity between the metadata.
</p>
<p>
I would prefer to model the concept of 'shared metadata' separately from the implementation detail of storage optimisation.  I think it is too problematic to impose this concept on a large range of datasets which may well not have intended this interpretation.
</p>
<p>
I think that we may well look to model this concept of explicit sharing, as part of the expansion into discrete sampling geometries and the extra data types introduced by CF 1.6 (currently out of scope).
</p>
<p>
For now, I think we should leave this concept, and just model what is explicit in CF 1.5: this leads me to state that sharing of metadata instances across Fields in CF 1.5 is an implementation detail with no implied concept of shared ownership. Co-location by evaluation is equivalent to co-location by implemented sharing.  
</p>
<p>
all the best

<strong>Coordinate and Field Relations</strong>
</p>
<p>
I would like to provide a couple of links to a UML concept, which I think is relevant to the discussion on how Fields relate to their Coordinates: Qualified Association.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a class="ext-link" href="http://etutorials.org/Programming/UML/Chapter+6.+Class+Diagrams+Advanced+Concepts/Qualified+Associations/"><span class="icon">​</span>Qualified Associations</a>

</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is a reasonable conceptual match to the approach taken by CF of providing a semantic free qualified relationship between each dimension of a Field and i) a DimensionCoordinate (or None); ii) any AuxiliaryCoordinates. 
</p>
<p>
In a NetCDF file, this is achieved using the NetCDF Dimension as a reference.  CF applies no semantics to the Dimension names, rather it uses Dimensions to define a Data Variable's dimensionality, ordering and extent and to associate a Data Variable with its Coordinate Variables and Auxiliary Coordinates.  It also provides the required singleton (or none) relationship between a Data Variable and each Data Variable Dimension's Coordinate Variable.

Hi Mark:
</p>
<p>
From my POV, you are mixing the data model a little bit with what software has to do to implement it.
</p>
<p>
I would say that its useful to capture shared coordinate systems in the CF abstract data model. CF also describes how to encode that. I think the notion that the coordinates are the same when they are identical or when their values and metadata are identical is a good one.
</p>
<p>
What software has to do to keep track of that while processing multiple variables and/or multiple files shouldnt really drive the data model, if possible. But of course in practice, developers will have to pay attention to those kinds of things.
</p>
<p>

John

Dear John, Mark, David, Bob, Ethan
</p>
<p>
I too agree with Mark's arguments for the independence of Fields. I think that logically the CF data model regards each Field as having its own set of coordinates, although in a CF-netCDF file they may actually be shared. John suggested that the data model should have a way to indicate that two fields share the same space. I interpreted that as meaning "a way to decide whether two fields share the same space" and agreed with it, but David and Mark somewhat disagreed.
</p>
<p>
If this notion of equality of spaces is not obvious in the CF-netCDF standard, it could be argued that we shouldn't include it in the data model. It is true that the CF standard doesn't say anything about it explicitly. On the other hand, the CF standard makes use of the Unidata convention that defines a coordinate variable, and that convention can naturally be interpreted as implying that data variables which share coordinate variables have a special relationship. I don't agree with that interpretation, because I think data variables might have just the same special relationship if they had distinct (but equal) coordinate variables in the same file, or if they were in different files but had equal coordinate variables.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I would argue that if the CF data model asserts that each Field is independent, and sharing coordinate variables doesn't indicate a special relationship, it would be helpful to supplement this by saying how you can instead decide whether two Fields share the same space. I agree with David that there are other kinds of condition, necessary for aggregation etc., but I feel that they're not quite so basic as this. In its abstract, the CF standard says that it "enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable". Deciding whether they have the same space is one aspect of that, isn't it. I don't think it's too much of a stretch to include it in the data model. It could be a case where the data model says something more clearly than the CF-netCDF standard so far does. In contributions that various people have made, we already seem to have quite a lot of agreement about what equality of spaces should entail.
</p>
<p>

This differs from the way David and I describe it in various ways:

<ul><li>The numerical value of the dimensions is repeated. I feel that it is neater to store it only once. Is that what you would do, in fact?
</li><li>The scalar coordinate appears to be of a different type from the multivalued coordinates, whereas the CF-netCDF convention implies (I think) that a scalar coordnate is logically equivalent to a size-one coordinate (and thus of the same type as a multivalued coordinate).
</li><li>In our model, because the dimension sizes and coordinate values belong together in the Dimension construct, an auxiliary coordinate variable with that Dimension shares the coordinate values as well as the size of a dimension. In your model, I suppose it wouldn't. For instance, <tt>lat(y,x)</tt> is really a function of the <tt>y</tt> and <tt>x</tt> coordinates, not just of the sizes of their dimensions. It could conceivably even be a data variable in its own right, with those dimensions and coordinates.

The ambiguity in the title of this ticket, <em>"CF data model and reference implementation"</em>, may be the root of this debate.  All agree that variables have the special (shared) coordinate relationship if
</p>
<ol><li>they share named coordinate variable(s);  or
</li><li>they have distinct, but identical coordinate variables in the same dataset
</li></ol><p>
No.1 is a degenerate form of no.2, so from a data modeling perspective I hear Jonathan arguing that no. 2 alone is sufficient. On the other hand from an implementation pov no. 1 is overwhelmingly the more common, and it can be implemented far more efficiently than no. 2, as it bypasses the need to inspect coordinate values. The conflict is <strong>Model</strong> vs <strong>Implementation</strong>.  Which leads to a statement like <em>"helpful to supplement this by saying how you can instead decide whether two Fields share the same space"</em> -- suggesting that implementation guidance be given while documenting the model. 
</p>

I'm wondering whether the more interesting (and harder) case is discussed elsewhere in this lengthy ticket:  Namely closure principles in CF (have they been stated?) give us that when we perform allowable subsetting operations on a CF dataset, they yield a new (virtual) CF dataset.  Two subset fields have the shared coordinate relationship when their subsetted coordinates meet criteria no. 2.  From an implementation pov this is an important new case, because it is not about <strong>files</strong> at all. This relationship between Fields needs to be evaluated after subset fields are defined.  (See text of Jonathan's para. with multiple references to 'files'.)

I agree with David that there are other kinds of condition, necessary for aggregation etc., but I feel that they're not quite so basic as this. In its abstract, the CF standard says that it "enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable". Deciding whether they have the same space is one aspect of that, isn't it. I don't think it's too much of a stretch to include it in the data model. It could be a case where the data model says something more clearly than the CF-netCDF standard so far does. In contributions that various people have made, we already seem to have quite a lot of agreement about what equality of spaces should entail.

The ambiguity in the title of this ticket, <em>"CF data model and reference implementation"</em>, may be the root of this debate.  All agree that variables have the special (shared) coordinate relationship if
</p>
<ol><li>they share named coordinate variable(s);  or
</li><li>they have distinct, but identical coordinate variables in the same dataset
</li></ol><p>
No.1 is a degenerate form of no.2, so from a data modeling perspective I hear Jonathan arguing that no. 2 alone is sufficient. On the other hand from an implementation pov no. 1 is overwhelmingly the more common, and it can be implemented far more efficiently than no. 2, as it bypasses the need to inspect coordinate values. The conflict is <strong>Model</strong> vs <strong>Implementation</strong>.  Which leads to a statement like <em>"helpful to supplement this by saying how you can instead decide whether two Fields share the same space"</em> -- suggesting that implementation guidance be given while documenting the model.

Hello Steve
</p>
<p>
I agree with your analysis about the ambiguity of the title of the ticket.  It was with this firmly in mind that an attempt to agree terms of reference for the data model was put onto a separate ticket (<a class="closed ticket" href="./88.html" title="task: Terms of Reference for the CF Data Model (closed: fixed)">#88</a>).  This discussion yielded agreement, including:
  
</p>
<ol start="9"><li>The data model provides a logical, implementation neutral, abstraction of the concepts defined by CF. 
</li></ol><p>
On this basis, I think that:
  
</p>
<ol><li>they share named coordinate variable(s);
</li></ol><p>
should be treated as an implementation detail, valuable, but below the required level of abstraction of the model.  The model should deal with the general case and leave freedom for implementations to provide powerful features such as this one in !NetCDF files.

This differs from the way David and I describe it in various ways:
</p>
<ul><li>The numerical value of the dimensions is repeated. I feel that it is neater to store it only once. Is that what you would do, in fact?
</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>
The shape(size, order) of each array of values, be they data or coordinate values, is a property of that array.  Thus the only place that the dimensions' extent and ordering is stored is as a property of the Field's data.  Coordinates of a Field are constrained to match sizes as part of their relationship.
</p>
<p>
A Dimension construct appears to repeat the storage of this information, in the Dimension instance and in the data arrays, introducing more complex constraints on the Field's data and its coordinate's values. 
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<ul><li>The scalar coordinate appears to be of a different type from the multivalued coordinates, whereas the CF-netCDF convention implies (I think) that a scalar coordinate is logically equivalent to a size-one coordinate (and thus of the same type as a multivalued coordinate).
</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>
The type of all 3 is the same, the are Coordinate instances.
</p>
<p>
They differ in how the Field refers to them.  In the example, I have defined a 2D data array, so only 2 DimCoords are permitted.  If the example dataset were a !NetCDF file the conventions enable (but do not force?) the Field to be defined as 3D, with one of the dimensions of size 1.  In this case the Field may refer to the Time Coordinate as a DimCoord, e.g.:
</p>
<ul><li>Field:
<ul><li>data = arr(shape(1,72,96))
</li><li>DimCoords = 
<ul><li>dim2 -&gt; Coordinate:
<ul><li>units="days since 2012-10-1"
</li><li>standard_name="time"
</li><li>points = arr(shape(1,))
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>
I think these are two subtly different Fields, both of which are useful.  It just happens that the !NetCDF encoding is not clear which one is intended, the conventions talk of a 'convenience feature'.  As changing a field from 2D to 3D by adding size 1 dimensions is a well defined and manageable operation I think it is a reasonable position to decide on a default behaviour and allow downstream users to reinterpret the Field instance if they require different behaviour.
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<ul><li>In our model, because the dimension sizes and coordinate values belong together in the Dimension construct, an auxiliary coordinate variable with that Dimension shares the coordinate values as well as the size of a dimension. In your model, I suppose it wouldn't. For instance, <tt>lat(y,x)</tt> is really a function of the <tt>y</tt> and <tt>x</tt> coordinates, not just of the sizes of their dimensions. It could conceivably even be a data variable in its own right, with those dimensions and coordinates.

We all seem to agree that the data model should be able to capture the notion of two fields sharing the same space. I think we also agree that the data model should define the set of conditions that are sufficient to recognize that two fields share the same space.
</p>
<p>
Given that, a dataset containing two fields that are both on the same space could be represented with a diagram something like this:
</p>
<pre class="wiki"> +--------+   +--------+
 | field1 |   | field2 |
 +--------+   +--------+
    |            |
    |            |    +--------+
    \------------\--&gt; | space1 |
                      +--------+
</pre><p>
That relationship of a shared space is the abstract concept we want to model.
</p>
<p>
How one maps that concept to an actual dataset stored in a file or files is an implementation detail for each encoding to decide. Some encodings could use shared coordinate variables or dimensions to indicate a shared space, others may require data users/providers to explicitly check all the appropriate conditions.
</p>
<p>
Where it seems there is some disagreement is whether the current CF-netCDF encoding requires data users/providers to explicitly check all the appropriate conditions. Or, if instead, it provides some encoding conveniences in the form of shared dimensions and shared coordinate variables that indicate the same relationship.

The netCDF data model captures, not just the fact that two fields share the same coordinate reference system (a.k.a. "space"), but also that they may be related by sharing degenerate subsets of that coordinate system.  Restated in more concrete terms, it is important in CF to recognize that a surface variable has a special relationship to a 3D variable that shares the same lat-long coordinates.

Can someone clarify where we are retaining these subtleties in the current discussions?

In general, I find my Spidey-senses quivering over the degree to which the CF data model wants to detach itself from the netCDF data model.  Detaching from the netCDF file format has clear value.  What advantages are we after in detaching from the netCDF data model?  The netCDF data model has an impressive, successful track record expressing the multi-dimensional space concepts that are embedded in CF.

I rather would say that the data model should provide the framework for ascertaining whether one field has a relationship to another. In your example, the data model should make it easy to formulate the tests required to see if the 2-d field is broadcastable across the 3-d field. There are many different types of special relationship.
</p>
<p>
<em>Please</em> forgive me if I'm missing something obvious here, but does the netCDF data model include the notion of shared spaces? It is nearly always implied in real netCDF files, but is not required or enforced by the Common Data Model. For example, there is nothing stopping me from duplicating, with different names, dimensions and coordinates for every variable in a netCDF file. It would still be a CF compliant netCDF file.

It would be very unusual for a CF data provider to create two coordinate variables that contained identical coordinate information in the self-same dataset.  If s/he were to do so, it would likely imply a deliberate differentiating between spaces (for some reason).

<p>
My guess of what is behind the current confusions is this (am I correct?):  Datasets that have been created in formats other than netCDF (say, format "foobar") may contain duplicated coordinate information in them with no explicit linkages indicating the coordinates are the same.  In order to treat these files as if they are CF files, a software implementation needs to examine the coordinates in detail and determine where they may be identically duplicated.  This situation should imho fall under the heading of "CF library support for format foobar".  This weaker form of modeling shared coordinate spaces should not imho be regarded as a feature of the CF data model.  We would be degrading the data model to do so.
</p>
<p>
Your question about <em>storage</em> versus <em>manipulation</em>:  The notion of shared coordinate spaces and subspaces is fundamental to the manipulation of CF variables.  Consider, for example, the common case of computing anomalies by subtracting a climatological mean field (X-Y-Z space) from individual model time steps (identical X-Y-Z plus T).

I'm a little confused by what this means.  Are you saying by this paragraph that the CF model shouldn't consider spaces which are automatically examined and calculated to be the same to be shared?  Therefore formats which don't support some way of indicating sharing (e.g. foobar) would lack this feature of the data model. 
</p>
<p>
I have to say I'm a little torn about automatically calculating sharing. We do it in some cases with regrid calculations in ESMF where if two sets of Fields have identical looking grids then there's no reason to recalculate the weights, because the results would be exactly the same.  However, I could see it being a problem in other cases, for example, where the user is reading in a set of Fields and the software keeps insisting that two have the same space just because they accidentally happen to have the same set of coordinates, or maybe as you suggest above the user deliberately wants to have them separate despite them being the same.

Half way down this ticket we stopped mentioning identity, and I'm not sure we resolved whether we wanted dimensions and spaces to have identity.  I know we believe that grids have identity, since we invented gridspec. So what about spaces?
</p>
<p>
Is some of this discussion confusing whether we know, via identifiers or *convention*, whether two fields share the same space, or whether we have to guess, (1) via inspection (as might have to do in the case of aggregation), or (2), via *custom* (the same named dimensions in the same file).
</p>
<p>
We need to decide whether the data model or the implementation, or both, ought to distinguish these different choices. Of course we still have the choice of spaces being integral to fields (i.e. composed in), in which case we'd have to invent a new abstraction to allow us to assert equality of spaces, if only for having rules for aggregation.

Hi Brian. I'm confused over points that are more basic:
</p>
<ol><li> What's our definition of a "space"? How is it distinct from "coordinate reference system" and "grid"?   (see (*) below)
</li><li>How did we morph from an effort to write down and clarify the CF model (which has been built upon the netCDF data model since its earliest days as COARDS) into a reconsideration of the foundation netCDF data model concepts?  What problems are we hoping to solve by this?
</li><li>What does "!NetCDF" mean?
</li></ol><ul><li> August 24 discussions above indicate confusion over the term "space".  <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/cfdm.html"><span class="icon">​</span>http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/cfdm.html</a> says a space is a coordinate system

In addition to what I wrote earlier, would it fair to say that the Common Data Model (CDM) is one for the <em>storage</em> of data, whilst the CF data model we are discussing is one for the <em>manipulation</em> of data?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hi David:
</p>
<p>
As the author of the CDM, I would say that the CDM is an abstract data model, in which the details of the storage and the specifics of the API are supposed to be minimized. Many storage file formats are supported; to date only a Java API has been developed. 
</p>
<p>
The CDM is expressed in UML, a language for object oriented design, because thats the common language of computer science for this purpose, and because Java is an OO language. OTOH, I havent developed the UML very deeply to show the available methods (which would better descipe the possible <em>manipulations</em>), really the Java API is the source of that. So the UML is really a very high level description, but probably at a similar level of detail as your efforts.
</p>
<p>
From my POV, ironically, I see the CF model as a bit more influenced by storage concerns. Of course, in the end, the data model had better have a very clean mapping to the actual storage, if you want to actually get anything done!

We're into some subtle areas of terminology and (human) semantics, but here is what I would say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The netCDF Data Model (which is a foundational part of CDM)provides a way to *express* the relationship between spaces (coordinate reference systems) through sharing of coordinate variables.  Having expressed it thusly, it also provides a way for software implementations to <em>ascertain whether one field has a relationship to another</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It would be very unusual for a CF data provider to create two coordinate variables that contained identical coordinate information in the self-same dataset.  If s/he were to do so, it would likely imply a deliberate differentiating between spaces (for some reason).
</p>
<p>
My guess of what is behind the current confusions is this (am I correct?):  Datasets that have been created in formats other than netCDF (say, format "foobar") may contain duplicated coordinate information in them with no explicit linkages indicating the coordinates are the same.  In order to treat these files as if they are CF files, a software implementation needs to examine the coordinates in detail and determine where they may be identically duplicated.  This situation should imho fall under the heading of "CF library support for format footer".  This weaker form of modeling shared coordinate spaces should not imho be regarded as a feature of the CF data model.  We would be degrading the data model to do so.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I'm a little confused by what this means.  Are you saying by this paragraph that the CF model shouldn't consider spaces which are automatically examined and calculated to be the same to be shared?  Therefore formats which don't support some way of indicating sharing (e.g. foobar) would lack this feature of the data model. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My understanding of what Steve is saying is that if we throw away shared dimensions and force applications to examine coordinate values in order to establish that two variables "share the same space", we would be degrading the data model from what we have now.
</p>
<p>
OTOH, it seems we have a rough consensus to allow both methods (shared dimensions, examination of values) 
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
I have to say I'm a little torn about automatically calculating sharing. We do it in some cases with regrid calculations in ESMF where if two sets of Fields have identical looking grids then there's no reason to recalculate the weights, because the results would be exactly the same.  However, I could see it being a problem in other cases, for example, where the user is reading in a set of Fields and the software keeps insisting that two have the same space just because they accidentally happen to have the same set of coordinates, or maybe as you suggest above the user deliberately wants to have them separate despite them being the same. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think we need to insist that if two variables share the exact same coordinate values, then they "have the same space". If there are caveats to that, let us list them.
</p>
<p>
Its possible you have another use case in mind, but Ive never seen two variables in the same dataset accidentally share coordinates.
</p>
<p>
HDF does not have shared dimensions, IMO with unfortunate results to interoperability. Read the 4-part series for more info than you want, starting here :

I believe that we cannot escape the need for the concept of a "dataset" in our discussions -- a "dataset" being the virtual file in which all of the data and metadata under discussion lie in the same container.  Aggregation machinery creates datasets (virtual files) out of physical files (more granular datasets).
</p>
<p>
A netCDF union aggregation (<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/v2.2/Cookbook.html"><span class="icon">​</span>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/v2.2/Cookbook.html</a>) takes variables that are in separate files, but have identical coordinates, and turns them into a new, larger dataset (virtual file) in which they have normal netCDF shared dimensions.  Gridspec datasets are another interesting (and more complex) case (<a class="ext-link" href="https://ice.txcorp.com/trac/modave/wiki/CFProposalGridspec"><span class="icon">​</span>https://ice.txcorp.com/trac/modave/wiki/CFProposalGridspec</a>).

<p>
This would be the inverse of the union operation. For sure there is a risk (or maybe intentional) loss of subtle semantics when variables are spread across independent files.  For example, the person doing this may know that some of the variables were satellite observations and others were model outputs on the same coordinate system and want to make sure that distinction is made clearer.

<p>
I doubt there is a fixed answer to this.  When one regrids a variable, for example, that may be an act of violence (a transient action), or a high fidelity operation (a legitimate, permanent change), depending upon underlying knowledge of the mathematical characteristics of the variable and its coordinates.

<p>
As of v1.6 CF says little about the relationships *between* variables.  The current CF discussions about vector quantities and staggered grids illustrate that even the most obvious relationships are not yet firmly characterized.  I'd suppose a flexible utility program such as you describe should leave control over such decisions to the user.

<p>
Good that you raised this point.  What is "netCDF"?  Is it a file format?  Or is it a data model with associated API's (behaviors)?  Today it is both, though for many years the file format was private/unpublished and the emphasis was firmly on the <strong>data model</strong>.  How are you intending the word "netCDF" above?  Questions such as you have raised seem to me ambiguous unless you qualify the word "netCDF" by saying "netCDF data model" or "netCDF file format".
</p>
<p>
The CF data model (conceptually) is imho built on the foundation of the netCDF data model.  The highly prized interoperability of CF datasets comes from its underpinnings in the netCDF data model.  This is why today legacy satellite data files can be made to look and feel like modern CF datasets when served through OPeNDAP via TDS and can be read by generic CF applications.
</p>
<p>
By the way -- IMHO the process of writing down the CF data model should as much as possible try to understand and erase the distinctions between "CF" and "CDM".  This is the path to broader interoperability.  Similarly, we should strive for a single method of expressing aggregations.  If in the end we were to have different aggregation machinery in Python and Java it would be a serious blow to interoperability.

Dear Mark
</p>
<p>
I am not sure whether we are debating non-existent distinctions regarding the Dimension constructs, nor whether I can make it any clearer, but I'll try again in words. :-)
</p>
<p>
David and I propose:
</p>
<ul><li>The Field has
<ul><li>Dimensions time, lat and lon.
</li><li>a data array dimensioned (lat,lon)
</li></ul></li><li>The lat Dimension has
<ul><li>size 72
</li><li>a data array of this size
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
You propose:
</p>
<ul><li>The Field has
<ul><li>a data array dimensioned (72,96)
</li></ul></li><li>The lat Coordinate has
<ul><li>a data array dimensioned (72)
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
You write, "The shape(size, order) of each array of values, be they data or coordinate values, is a property of that array. Thus the only place that the dimensions' extent and ordering is stored is as a property of the Field's data. Coordinates of a Field are constrained to match sizes as part of their relationship." I understand this to mean that in your proposal there is also a mechanism which requires the two occurrences of 72 to be equal. To make that happen, you must know there is some logical association between them; in a netCDF file, the relationship is that they refer to the same netCDF dimension of course.
</p>
<p>
This is what our arrangement does too. Our Dimension construct contains the netCDF dimension and the 1D coordinate variable of the same name. You comment, "A Dimension construct appears to repeat the storage of this information, in the Dimension instance and in the data arrays." That is not our intention. The Dimension construct contains the size of the dimension. The Field data array is declared using these Dimensions, in just the same way that a netCDF data variable is declared using the dimensions. There is no explicit mechanism to link the two 72s, because (logically) there is only one 72, which is stored in the Dimension construct. The difference between our points of view this far is small. It is just that the Dimension, in our model, has a distinct identity.
</p>
<p>
I think there may be a somewhat greater difference when we come to the further point which I made, not clearly enough. I wrote, "In our model, because the dimension sizes and coordinate values belong together in the Dimension construct, an auxiliary coordinate variable with that Dimension shares the coordinate values as well as the size of a dimension." For instance, if we have Dimensions of x and y (projection coordinates), we might have a longitude Auxiliary coordinate construct whose data array is dimensioned (y,x). In our model, the Dimensions y and x provide not only the sizes of the dimensions, but also 1D x- and y-coordinate variables. Thus the 2D longitude variable is a function of these coordinate variables. That seems fine to me because it genuinely reflects the situation. The association is there in your model as well, but slightly less direct, I suppose. Because the 72 and 96 of the 2D auxiliary coordinate variable are constrained somehow to correspond to the 72 and 96 of the field, and to the 72 and 96 of the 1D coordinate variables, the 1D coordinate variables are indirectly associated with the dimensions of the 2D coordinate variable.
</p>
<p>
On the scalar or size-1 coordinate variables, again we almost agree, but perhaps not quite. We take the view that they are Dimensions of the Field with size 1, but not necessarily used to dimension the data variable. In the example I gave at the top, time is a Dimension of the Field and has size 1, and is omitted from the dimensions of the Field data array. As you say, the CF convention says that size-1 and scalar coordinate variables are equivalent. We agree that inserting and removing them from the Field data array is easy. In our model, therefore, size-1 Dimensions are optionally used to the dimension the Field data array. We think the user may want the choice. When you slice one level from a 3D Field, for instance, you may wish the new Field to be 3D, with the vertical Dimension having size 1. The API could provide a separate method to eliminate size-1 dimensions in case the user does not want them, or it could be a choice to be made in the slice method. The bottom line is that in our data model the Field has Dimensions, but its data array can omit Dimensions of size 1. That's another reason why the Dimensions have a distinct identity in the Field in our model.

Dear Steve, Mark, et al.
</p>
<p>
Comments on a couple of points recently raised.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Departure from the netCDF data model</strong>
</p>
<p>
Regarding tests for equality of spaces, Steve asks where we want to depart from the netCDF data model. Subsequently Steve comments, <em>It would be very unusual for a CF data provider to create two coordinate variables that contained identical coordinate information in the self-same dataset. If s/he were to do so, it would likely imply a deliberate differentiating between spaces (for some reason).</em>
</p>
<p>
I agree that this is unlikely in the same file, but it could happen, and it might be accidental. It might happen if one file had been made by assembling variables from separate files, without checking whether the coordinate variables would be duplicated.
</p>
<p>
But a more important case is the one of <em>aggregation</em> of multiple files into one virtual dataset. I think this is the reason why we must go beyond the netCDF data model and the CF convention as it currently stands, since they refer only to single files in principle. Aggregation may involve concatenating many data variables into one, but before you get to that stage, you have to recognise that the variables may have some identical coordinates. I would put it as a requirement that two variables in the same file, with the same lat and lon (shared) coordinates (but different time coordinates, say) are in exactly the same logical relationship as two variables in different files, with equal (but necessarily distinct) lat and lon coordinate variables. It is more work to verify the second case, but that's a matter of implementation, as has already been said.
</p>
<p>
A third case, as Steve has also mentioned, is if the data is not netCDF anyway, and has no way of sharing coordinate variables. In that case you have to check the hard way. But again, this is an implementation issue which should not prevent the recognition of the same logical relationship.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is a space?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Steve asks, <em>What's our definition of a "space"? How is it distinct from
"coordinate reference system" and "grid"?</em> In our proposed data model, David and I use "space" to mean "Field without data", and without metadata describing the contents of the data array such as <tt>standard_name</tt>. The space has the dimension coordinates, auxiliary coordinates, cell methods and cell measures. When we described it as being a "coordinate system", we meant only, "a set of coordinates in a particular relationship." We did not mean "coordinate reference system" in the more technical and restrictive senses of OGC and so on.
</p>
<p>
Mark comments, <em>I think we should be careful in talking of sharing a Space: many of the cases discussed here are of data variables which share some Coordinates, but not all. I prefer to talk of shared Coordinates etc. as I think it is clearer."</em> These are distinct, and we should be careful, I agree. One issue is comparison of coordinates: are they identical (shared) or equal. The equality of two spaces means also that they have the same <em>set</em> of coordinates, cell measures, etc.
</p>
<p>
Cheers
</p>

Hi all,
</p>
<p>
Just a brief comment (sorry, I can't pretend I've read and understood all the above in detail!)  I wonder if the general ISO/OGC terminology might be helpful here, particularly if this discussion somehow transcends NetCDF and intends to cover other file formats that may be encoding forms of the same conceptual data model.
</p>
<p>
(For those of you who are dying to read an ISO spec, the most relevant one here is ISO19123, which deals with Coverages.  This spec is known to be incomplete and a little ambiguous with respect to this community's needs - however it's not a bad starting point and codifies a number of relevant concepts.  This reminds me that I really should write up my work on applying and modifying the Coverage model to CF-NetCDF data...)
</p>
<p>
In particular, the above term "space" seems to be equivalent to the concept of a "domain" in the ISO world.  A domain is simply the set of positions for which we may have values (the values are encoded in the "range", which is the equivalent of a NetCDF data array).  For gridded data, the domain will be a ReferenceableGrid (which is a grid that may be curvilinear or rectilinear but is referenced to some real-world coordinate reference system).  Grids are made up of cells, but the ISO model lacks an equivalent of CF's cell_methods, unless I've missed something.
</p>
<p>
There's a whole heap of concepts that could be relevant, but I would start by suggesting the use of the term "domain".

Dear Jon
</p>
<p>
"Coverage" sounds like a 2D concept to me, and "coordinate reference system" is usually understood to be 2D. Hence I think "space" is better, because it is at least 3D, and often used to mean n-dimensional, which is what we mean.

Dear Jonathan,
</p>
<p>
It's true that the term "coverage" has history in 2D satellite imagery - but the modern definition is simply a function that maps positions in a domain to data values.  The domain can be an nD grid or any other type of geometry, and can be applied to in situ observations or swaths as much as to gridded data.
</p>
<p>
Coordinate reference systems can also be nD.  There is no 2D restriction.
</p>
<p>
(Actually "space" is equivalent to "domain", not "coverage".  Personally I prefer the term "domain" to "space", as it feels more precise to me.)

<p>
Yes, I agree with Jon and Mark here. The argument is that we should try to use the terminology thats already in existence in similar work, as it will lead to broader acceptance of ours. So, if "space" is really a synonym for "domain", then "domain" is probably a better choice. If its not, then lets clarify that.

Support for the CF code may become very difficult with this outlook.  The preceding paragraph suggests that the CF libraries have requirements to make sense of malformed datasets.  This seems a slippery slope.  How do you bound a requirement like this?
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
But a more important case is the one of <em>aggregation</em> of multiple files into one virtual dataset. I think this is the reason why we must go beyond the netCDF data model and the CF convention as it currently stands, since they refer only to single files in principle.

I wonder if there may be much less disagreement than it seems here.  We are lumping many distinct behaviors under the single heading of "CF and Python": support for non-netCDF datasets, for malformed datasets, and for aggregations.  We might find the disagreement disappearing if we shared a mental picture of the architecture of the code.  Thinking of the code as extensible layers of functionality, here is the code architecture that I am imagining:

"coordinate reference system" and "grid"?</em> In our proposed data model, David and I use "space" to mean "Field without data", and without metadata describing the contents of the data array such as <tt>standard_name</tt>. The space has the dimension coordinates, auxiliary coordinates, cell methods and cell measures. When we described it as being a "coordinate system", we meant only, "a set of coordinates in a particular relationship." We did not mean "coordinate reference system" in the more technical and restrictive senses of OGC and so on.
</p>
<p>
Mark comments, <em>I think we should be careful in talking of sharing a Space: many of the cases discussed here are of data variables which share some Coordinates, but not all. I prefer to talk of shared Coordinates etc. as I think it is clearer."</em> These are distinct, and we should be careful, I agree. One issue is comparison of coordinates: are they identical (shared) or equal. The equality of two spaces means also that they have the same <em>set</em> of coordinates, cell measures, etc.

In particular, the above term "space" seems to be equivalent to the concept of a "domain" in the ISO world.  A domain is simply the set of positions for which we may have values (the values are encoded in the "range", which is the equivalent of a NetCDF data array).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The "range" in the ISO/OGC coverage model that Jon mentions can hold multiple values for each position in the "domain". So, multiple CF-netCDF data variables that share the same "domain" can be modeled as a single coverage. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I don't believe the coverage model could be used to capture the notion that two variables share a subset of their domain. An idea mentioned by both Steve:

The netCDF data model captures, not just the fact that two fields share the same coordinate reference system (a.k.a. "space"), but also that they may be related by sharing degenerate subsets of that coordinate system. Restated in more concrete terms, it is important in CF to recognize that a surface variable has a special relationship to a 3D variable that shares the same lat-long coordinates.

Hello Jonathan
</p>
<p>
I think that there are subtle differences about information storage between our perspectives, but I do not think these are the crucial factor.  
</p>
<p>
Part of my concern is terminology, I do not like the name Dimension you have given to the construct you have defined.  I have struggled to come up with an alternative name, I am struggling to capture what this construct is.
</p>
<p>
I have concerns about the definition of identity for Dimension constructs, I do not think we have ever had a vocabulary within CF to do this for NetCDF files: NetCDF Dimensions are used as references within CF with no implied semantics.  As such they do not feel like good candidate constructs to me.  I prefer the ordered list of 'dims' to be a simple property of the Field.
</p>
<p>
I prefer to consider NetCDF dimensions as a way of linking Fields to their coordinates.  I think the CF data model should take an abstracted view of this and just mandate that coordinates must be related to the dimensions of the data.
</p>
<p>
I think this brings particular benefit by providing similarities between Coordinates.  Specifically, there are two types: the general type (Coord) and the constrained type (Coordinate), which must be numerical, one dimensional and monotonic. 
</p>
<p>
How these are used by a Field is the responsibility of the Field, which may define 0or1 Coordinates for each of its dims and as many Coords as required, linked to the dims appropriately.    
</p>
<p>
I have prepared a sketch of this in UML to illustrate <a class="ext-link" href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/attachment/wiki/PotentialDataModelTypes/coord_subcf1.5.png"><span class="icon">​</span>Field and Coordinate</a>
</p>
<p>
This uses qualified associations, as described in <a class="ticket" href="./68#comment:84" title="Comment 84">markh</a>.
</p>
<p>
I feel this is a better description of the current conventions for NetCDF than the Dimension construct and provides flexibility to implementers of the model to manage the relationships using appropriate means for that implementation.
</p>
<p>
I think it has particular benefit in providing clear definition of how Coords may be identified as potential Coordinates and how a Field explicitly defines its dim_coords and aux_coords.
</p>
<p>
Regarding single valued coordinates, I see no need to provide a construct of a Dimension of size 1 which does not match up to part of the Field's data, I think it is enough to allow a Coordinate to be used to define a Field's dimension.  The Field may be changed, for example increasing dimensionality, and the referencing will be updated at that point.

I wonder if there may be much less disagreement than it seems here.  We are lumping many distinct behaviors under the single heading of "CF and Python": support for non-netCDF datasets, for malformed datasets, and for aggregations.  We might find the disagreement disappearing if we shared a mental picture of the architecture of the code.

which I think has lead to a number of mis-communications, but never mind.
</p>
<p>
At that point we agreed the scope of this ticket to be defined by <a class="ext-link" href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov./88#comment:21"><span class="icon">​</span>88</a>
</p>
<p>
The scope is thus to define an abstract model, consistent with the CF conventions for NetCDF files at version 1.5.
</p>
<p>
Within this scope I don't think there is a code architecture.  Instead I think there is a conceptual model, a set of types/constructs with clearly defined attributes and relations.  
</p>
<p>
This model will map to how CF datasets are stored in NetCDF files, an implementation of the CF model.
</p>
<p>
Any other implementations, such as ones inferred by your diagrams, I would like to consider out of scope for this ticket and concentrate efforts on defining types and relations independent of any implementation.   Do you think this is a practical approach?

Dear all,

<blockquote>
<p>
now, come on please! This discussion has left planet Earth and is bound to frustrate everyone but a tiny bunch of nerds. Who in his/her right mind is going to care about a distinction between "dimensions", "dims", "Coords", and "Coordinates" (and possibly also "coordinates", "Dimensions", etc.)? I can see that this issue as such requires clarification, but more than anything else, I believe it requires a decision and then an understandable text that provides clear guidance what is meant plus an explanation why things were defined the way they are.
</p>

<p>
It may help to adopt a tabular approach here and list the various properties or features of what is meant with each concept, and then decide which of these is most appropriate for the data model as such, and which concepts are implementation rules. As I was simpl yunable to read through all the detailed comments here, I may fail in puttign this together correctly, but from my humble understanding, one could start as follows:
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
let A be "dimension" as implemented in netcdf,
let B be "dimension" as "one component of something defining the extent of a field",
let C be a "spatio-temporal dimension"

In case it helps, here's the terminology I'm currently using in our internal APIs.  It's based on the ISO terminology but I've had to fill in some gaps where ISO was not adequate.  Feel free to use or ignore as you wish!
</p>
<table class="wiki">
<tr><td><strong>Term</strong></td><td><strong>Meaning</strong></td><td><strong>Equivalent in NetCDF</strong></td><td><strong>Origin</strong>
</td></tr><tr><td>Domain</td><td>A set of spatiotemporal positions</td><td>Derived from Dimensions and Coordinate Variables</td><td>ISO19123
</td></tr><tr><td>Range</td><td>A set of data values</td><td>Variable</td><td>ISO19123
</td></tr><tr><td>Coverage</td><td>Maps positions in a Domain to values from a Range.  Can contain multiple variables as long as they share a Domain.</td><td>Variable with georeferencing</td><td>ISO19123
</td></tr><tr><td>Grid</td><td>nD array with no data and no georeferencing implied</td><td>List of Dimensions</td><td>ISO19123
</td></tr><tr><td>GridAxis</td><td>One of the axes of a Grid</td><td>Dimension</td><td>I made this up
</td></tr><tr><td>ReferenceableGrid</td><td>A Grid with spatiotemporal referencing (but no data values). It is also a Domain.</td><td>No direct equivalent</td><td>ISO19123
</td></tr><tr><td>ReferenceableAxis</td><td>A GridAxis that is referenced to x,y,z or t. Can be composed to form ReferenceableGrids</td><td>Dimension with associated xyzt Coordinate Variable</td><td>I made this up
</td></tr><tr><td>GridValuesMatrix</td><td>A Range that organizes its values in a Grid topology</td><td>Multidimensional Variable</td><td>ISO19123
</td></tr></table>
<p>
For curvilinear grids, I model these as a 2D ReferenceableGrid that cannot be decomposed into 1D ReferenceableAxes.
</p>
<p>
Following up on Ethan's point, you can detect that different Coverages might share some of their Domains with other Coverages (e.g. a 3D Coverage might share two axes with a 2D Coverage) by inspection of the axes involved.  However, looking at other kinds of subsetting relationships is hard, and is also hard to express in a data model.
</p>
<p>
Hope this is somehow helpful.  In designing our internal APIs it's certainly been helpful to me to figure out the distinction between all these concepts.

Thanks, Jon! This helps indeed!

<p>
Just a quick question, though: how would you call things and code the data in the followng two cases:
</p>
<p>
1) spectral variables (netcdf dimensions (time, level, 2, wavenumber) -- the 2 to distinguish between real and imaginary part); in a certain sense these do have spatio-temporal referencing
</p>
<p>
2) output from "irregular" grids such as icosahedric, where you basically have lists of points with lon/lat information, but no "system" to decompose them into lon and lat vectors
?

Hi Mark, et al.,
</p>
<p>
It was mentioned that ticket <a class="closed ticket" href="./88.html" title="task: Terms of Reference for the CF Data Model (closed: fixed)">#88</a> says that the data model should be consistent with the CF conventions for netCDF files. However, ticket <a class="closed ticket" href="./88.html" title="task: Terms of Reference for the CF Data Model (closed: fixed)">#88</a> explicitly removes netCDF considerations from the CF data model.
</p>
<p>
In <a class="closed ticket" href="./88.html" title="task: Terms of Reference for the CF Data Model (closed: fixed)">#88</a> it was agreed that <em>Independence of file format distinguishes it from the CF-netCDF data model and the CDM</em>, and that this will <em>set the ground work to expand CF beyond netCDF files</em>.
</p>
<p>
I think that this really important, and bearing in mind Martin's insightful comments, perhaps noting this again could help clarify matters.

All the best,

Hi Martin!  To be honest I'm not sure how I would deal with spectral data or "irregular" grids - I think they would both require different constructs since the classes above are just for rectangular grids.  I think there has been work on CF irregular grids elsewhere - I guess the data model just needs to be able to record the topology of interconnections.

Hi Mark, et al.,
</p>
<p>
It was mentioned that ticket <a class="closed ticket" href="./88.html" title="task: Terms of Reference for the CF Data Model (closed: fixed)">#88</a> says that the data model should be consistent with the CF conventions for netCDF files. However, ticket <a class="closed ticket" href="./88.html" title="task: Terms of Reference for the CF Data Model (closed: fixed)">#88</a> explicitly removes netCDF considerations from the CF data model.
</p>
<p>
In <a class="closed ticket" href="./88.html" title="task: Terms of Reference for the CF Data Model (closed: fixed)">#88</a> it was agreed that <em>Independence of file format distinguishes it from the CF-netCDF data model and the CDM</em>, and that this will <em>set the ground work to expand CF beyond netCDF files</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hi Mark,
</p>
<p>
The preceding quote lies deep within the discussions in the body of ticket <a class="closed ticket" href="./88.html" title="task: Terms of Reference for the CF Data Model (closed: fixed)">#88</a> and does not imho necessarily represent the spirit of the terms of reference or the level of agreement that exists. 
</p>
<p>
Frankly, our entire CF discussion feels like it is exposing a gulf in communications that exists between two parallel universes:  the world of Java netCDF and the world of non-Java netCDF.  How can we be speaking of <em>setting the ground work to expand CF beyond netCDF files</em>, when we have been actively working with CF datasets in other formats for 5 years or more (GRIB, legacy satellite programs, etc.)?  Ticket <a class="new ticket" href="./78.html" title="enhancement: CF aggregation rules (new)">#78</a> (Aggregation rules) states <em>The CF-netCDF convention at present applies only to individual files, but there is a common and increasing need to be able to treat a collection files as a single dataset</em>, but this statement is patently untrue.  We have had a working solutions to aggregations since COARDS days (over a decade ago), and we have been performing aggregations of virtual datasets (not just physical files) since those ancient times.
</p>
<p>
A central goal of the CF data modeling effort should be to help unite these two universes as quickly, painless, and effectively as it can.  The universe of Java netCDF-CF is presently a quantum leap ahead of the parallel non-Java universe.  We will not achieve our goal of uniting these universes unless we understand what has already been developed in the parallel Java universe, and include those advances in the baseline of our thinking and planning.

For what it's worth, my own group at PMEL has for years done development work in both the Java and the non-Java universes.  We are acutely aware of the gulf that exists between these two.  For example, in order to harness the aggregation capabilities of the Java netCDF from non-Java clients, we must host the data in a TDS web server and read it through OPeNDAP.  Ditto for reading the non-netCDF formats.  Today we are seeing some of the reverse; advances in CF gridspec and CF ugrid are taking place in the non-Java universe and leaving the Java side behind.  There's a need (and an opportunity) for a break-through in interoperability!

IMHO one of the reasons why this has happened is that NCML has become a defacto standard by usage, but not by definition. You would have thought one could have built an NCML type aggregator in other languages, but two of the many reasons stopping that are the ongoing worries that NCML might a) not be well defined (from a coding point of view), and b) be a moving target.

<p>
Yes, i agree that NcML is not completely defined and has continued to evolve. I think that the non-aggregation part of NcML could mostly be standardized, and I would welcome that effort. 
</p>
<p>
Standardization on aggregation, OTOH, would probably be premature. In essence, NcML aggregation is just "version 1" of what needs to happen. We have the start of "version 2" in the latest TDS/CDM version 4.3, and it works better on the server, partly because in some cases, an aggregation results in multiple logical datasets, whereas NcML is about a single logical dataset.
</p>
<p>
Its also important to note that NcML is just a configuration language for the CDM data model. One really wants to define aggregation on the data model.

FYI, the CDM coordinate system object model defines an abstract "coordinate transformation" object, with subclasses "horizontal transform" and "vertical transform", which are specified by a grid_mapping variable and a dimensionless vertical coordinate, respectively.

Its helpful to separate the CF encoding, which for historical reasons look somewhat different, from the data model abstractions, which I think are not so different.

Dear all
</p>
<p>
This has become a rather wide-ranging discussion, which is interesting and useful, but at the same time I'd like to recall that the aim of this ticket is to agree a CF data model description. The ticket began with the <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/cfdm.html"><span class="icon">​</span>document</a> that David and I proposed. I wonder if we could focus on this document, and discuss our agreements and disagreements about it, like we do with changes to the convention?
</p>
<p>
I think there are several threads which relate specifically to aspects of this document. If I have been sufficiently clear below, it might be useful if anyone who dissents from these summaries could say so. If we agree on them, we have made progress.
</p>
<ul><li>What to call the space in which the field exists. David and I called it a <em>space</em>, but we are OK with calling it a <em>domain</em> instead, following Jon's suggestion, which various people support. As far as I can see, no-one disagrees with <em>domain</em>. But note that it is not purely spatiotemporal (unlike Jon's table), since CF allows non-spatiotemporal coordinates. Also, it is not defined only by coordinates, but also cell measures, cell methods and transforms (i.e. grid mapping and formula terms), as has already been discussed.
</li></ul><ul><li>Whether the data model should specifically mention the possibility of a domain existing without a data in it i.e. a field with no data. David and I included this by saying that the data array is optional in the field. There has been agreement that this could be useful, but Mark has argued that since CF-netCDF doesn't currently have a convention for a field with no data, we shouldn't mention it in the data model. I can't argue against this, since it's the usual view we take about CF, that we don't add to it until we need to. So we should remove it for the moment from the proposed data model (but keep it in mind as an appealing and probably useful generalisation). OK?
</li></ul><ul><li>Whether dimensions have an independent identity in the field. This is a subtle question, it seems. If it has no consequence at all for how we write applications, then it's a useless question and and there's no need to settle it. I am not sure if this is the case. In my last posting, I said that I thought the idea of a 1D dimension and 1D coordinate belonging together comes from the Unidata netCDF convention of equality of name between coordinate variable and dimension. Mark disagrees. However, part of the problem is nomenclature, Mark feels, and I agree in not liking to use the word <em>dimension</em> for this concept. I note that Jon uses the term <em>GridAxis</em>, which he defines as <em>one of the axes of a Grid</em>. This feels like the same concept as David and I are getting at. We would have liked to use the word <em>axis</em> for it, but unfortunately in another CF ticket it has been agreed that the CF <tt>axis</tt> attribute can be given to auxiliary (possibly multidimensional) coordinate variables, so <em>axis</em> alone would now be a confusing word for a specifically 1D idea. However, inspired by Jon's table, I'd like to make a new suggestion. Could we call a 1D axis a <em>domain axis</em>? Our CF data model would then distinguish <em>domain axis construct</em> (corresponding to netCDF dimension and the 1D coordinate variable of the same name, if there is one) and <em>auxiliary coordinate construct</em> (corresponding to a CF-netCDF auxiliary coordinate variable). Both the auxiliary coordinates and the field itself refer to the domain axes. What do others think?
</li></ul><ul><li>Whether fields are independent as far as the data model is concerned. I think that everyone agrees with this, provided that we also note that it is possible to test, using the information described by the data model, whether two fields are defined with the same domain, and that if the fields are actually contained in a single CF-netCDF file, identity of dimensions and coordinates may make it easier to verify that two fields are defined with the same domain. Is that OK with everyone? (As an aside, in response to Steve, I do not agree that a CF-netCDF file which has duplicate coordinate variables is malformed. It is not ideal, but it's legal, and I expect it could be produced by generally well-behaved software.)
</li></ul><ul><li>I think we all agree that there is a need for the CF data model to envisage fields which are distributed over several CF-netCDF files or which reside in non-netCDF files or in memory. Steve argues that we are already doing it, and he's right. Nonetheless the CF-netCDF convention does <strong>not</strong> deal with this. It is for <strong>individual netCDF files</strong> and says nothing about aggregation rules or non-netCDF files. The question is whether, <em>despite</em> this limitation, we should write the CF data model description to permit the idea of fields spread over several datasets or in non-netCDF files. Do we all agree that we should do that?
</li></ul><ul><li>I suspect we all agree that we do not want the CF data model to contain rules for aggregation. John has just made such a remark. We acknowledge the need to be able to do this, but we are not ready to standardise it. The CDM and NCML support aggregation according to certain rules. David and I have proposed a different set of aggregation rules in ticket 78, which David has implemented in cf-python. Aggregation rules are a step beyond the CF data model at the moment. Is that OK?
</li></ul><p>
I note that we have another thread about transforms, grid mappings and formula terms, but I need to think more about that one!
</p>
<p>
Best wishes

Dear Jonathan,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
very nice summary from my point of view. Only one philosophical question concerning the point about "fields distributed over several CF-netcdf files": in my perhaps naive understanding, the data model should treat this as one field, and it is an implementation issue to allow for the field being distributed across several "sources". One can think of a generic memory mapping concept here, where the application must be aware of the total dimensionality of the domain and manage separately which chunks of this domain are currently loaded (as well as which chunks may be available at all). In fact, I recently came across some website where people made a point about ensembles which can be regarded as a typical sixths dimension (3*space, time, variable, ensemble member). This might require another distribution of fields across files, and in this case the fact that the fields belong together might not even be apparent from any netcdf dimension value.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
</p>
<p>
Martin

Thanks for the nice summary, Jonathan.

<ol><li>I agree with Martin <em>the data model should treat [a field distributed over multiple files] as one field</em>.  It seems intuitively that the data model should not talk about "files" at all -- only about the abstractions of "domains", "fields" and "datasets".  Can someone articulate the counter-argument?
</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Regarding bullet 4 above -- the significance of a domain that gets defined more than once, repeated independently through the definition of multiple fields (a.k.a. <em>Whether fields ["domains"?] are independent as far as the data model is concerned</em>):  I don't think this is an issue for the data model at all.  Including duplicated domain definitions in the data model will generate complexity downstream.  For what benefit?  Multiply defined domains are an artifact of the specific files that have been created (yes, mal-formed from the perspective of the data model).  They are best dealt with as an implementation issue, imho.  My bias is to keep the data model as simple (and "pure") as possible.

Great summary Jonathan.
</p>
<p>
Taking your bullets one at at time:
</p>
<ol><li>I think it's ok to generalise domain beyond spatio-temporal coordinates alone.
</li><li>A couple of use cases to consider for the dataless case: gridspec definitions, and irregular grids (I think in the instance of defining a data model, we should be a little more future looking than we are in our normal CF behaviour, there isn't much point in developing a new abstraction that can't cope with things we know are in our queue right now).
</li><li>I think domain axis nicely avoids the difficulty that dimension variously can be interpreted as an axis and a length ... +1 from me.
</li><li>I'm happy with this, I rather think it'd be nice to allow in the data model for a specific identity to apply to the domain though, so you can specifically share if you want to (rather than implicitly). This of course immediately allows the idea of a domain definition in one file, and the data in others, and plays straight into the dataless option ... <em>even if we do not in our current implementation allow this</em>!
</li><li>So my previous point is stating that I agree with this!
</li><li>Agreed. Aggregation rules are an implementation detail wrt the data model.

<p>
Thank you for the summary Jonathan.   I am happy with all but one of the statements you make; I think this represents real progress in our model development.
</p>
<p>
I am not yet convinced about the <a class="missing wiki">Dimension/DomainAxis?</a> construct.  I agree that Dimension is an unhelpful name but I do not think this is just an issue of nomenclature.
</p>
<p>
I'll try to summarise my concerns:
</p>
<ul><li>By defining a type in the data model, I feel that we are mandating that all applications implement this type, yet I do not feel it is necessary.  I think the model is cleaner leaving the management of the relationship between Fields and all varieties of coordinate to the implementation and just mandating the nature of the relationship.  As such I prefer a less specified model, with a qualified association.
</li><li>We appear to be mandating that an instance of a DomainAxis must exist, even when it is defined by no coordinate, this feels overly prescriptive and unhelpful to me.  I think it is valid to answer the question 'what defines this dimension of the Field' with the response 'Nothing'.
<ul><li>The information carried by a DomainAxis not containing a coordinate appears to me to be nothing (as I think the definition of extent of the array is held by the Field) 
</li></ul></li><li>I think the difference between an AuxiliaryCoordinate construct and a DomainAxis type, containing what seems to me to be a constrained AuxiliaryCoordinate is overstated by the model.  These types are very similar in my mind, I would really like the model to reflect this similarity.  
<ul><li>They mainly differ in how they are used by their containing Field, I would prefer this to be managed more clearly by the Field.  
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
You rightly bring up the question: 'What difference does this make to an implementing application?'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My concern is that we are overly constraining an implementation to handle the relationships between Fields and their coordinates using this construct. The model can be less proscriptive whilst still capturing all of the constraints which the CF model mandates. It just feels unnecessary to me, I don't think we should model unnecessary things. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
I think we should err on the side of less proscriptive modelling to enable implementation freedom where we can.  I think that the qualified association approach offers a better balance for this.

Dear Mark,
</p>
<p>
Domain axis is fine with me, too.
</p>
<p>
The DomainAxis is a thorny one. I offer some alternate view points to your concerns.
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<ul><li>By defining a type in the data model, I feel that we are mandating that all applications implement this type, yet I do not feel it is necessary. 
</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>
I agree that it is not necessary, but I don't think that we are suggesting such mandatory behaviour. As an example, cf-python, which is faithful to the proposed data model, doesn't have a DomainAxis (python) object.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
(Skipable detail alert!) I have preferred so far to be lightweight and store strings for axis identities and a simple  table relating each string to its size. The field contains an unordered collection of coordinates and the field knows whether each one belongs conceptually to a domain axis or is an auxiliary coordinate (in which case the field knows the ordered list of domain axes which it requires). Conversely, it is easy for the field to check whether a domain axis has a coordinate array.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This captures the spirit and functionality of the data model because domain axes do exist independently of coordinate arrays, even though there is no DomainAxis object which explicitly contains a coordinate.
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<ul><li>The information carried by a DomainAxis not containing a coordinate appears to me to be nothing (as I think the definition of extent of the array is held by the Field) 
</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>
I think a domain axis not containing a coordinate array carries information on its size and its identity. Its size will be 1 and its identity is required by other constructs which need an ordered list of domain axes, such as any construct which contains a data array (cell measure, auxiliary corodinate, field, etc.)
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">

<p>
It seems to me that a DomainAxis construct is quite different to an AuxiliaryCoordinate construct. It may <em>contain</em> what is essentially a constrained AuxiliaryCoordinate, but I don't think that it is one itself.
</p>
<p>
I don't think I fully understand the 'dim' and 'dims' boxes in your very helpful <a class="ext-link" href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/attachment/wiki/PotentialDataModelTypes/coord_cf1.5.png"><span class="icon">​</span>UML diagram</a>, but it seems to me that your 'dim' is in fact very similar to  our DomainAxis construct in that it has an identity and it is not a coordinate but may (or may not) contain a constrained coordinate. If this is all wrong, please correct me.
</p>
<p>
All the best,
</p>

David

To follow up Mark and David's last comments.  I think there are often differences between data models and real code - just because a class exists in a data model doesn't mean that it has to exist in an API. Although pure "model-driven developers" might disagree with me, I find that adhering too literally to a data model in code can lead to very awkward code that doesn't follow good practice or idioms of the language in question (such code also tends to be verbose).  So I would be completely comfortable having, for example, DomainAxis in a data model, but having different ways of achieving this.
</p>
<p>
(For example, I'm writing an API to deal with data using some of the ISO data model, but I'm certainly not going to implement all those classes literally!  The important thing is to make sure that the API can express the same concepts accurately for the intended applications.)
</p>
<p>
Literal translations of abstract data models tend to be more useful in building data-exchange formats than APIs.  (E.g. The NetCDF data model translates quite simply and uncontroversially into NcML, but the same data model translates into many different APIs, which reflect the characteristics of the language involved.)
</p>
<p>
Just some thoughts,
Jon

<p>
I would like to second this.  Our ESMF regridding software can already generate interpolation weights for a subset of the GRIDSPEC convention where we don't require a data field. I know that this is for a version of CF beyond the one under consideration, but for the sake of consistency between different versions of the data model it seems better to build a property like not requiring data in from the beginning rather than change it later.

<p>
That is a really helpful clarification and, I think, something of a restatement of comments you made previously that I don't think I had properly taken on board.

I will consider this carefully and how it affects the issues we are discussing.

<p>
For what it's worth, my own group at PMEL has for years done development work in both the Java and the non-Java universes.  We are acutely aware of the gulf that exists between these two.  For example, in order to harness the aggregation capabilities of the Java netCDF from non-Java clients, we must host the data in a TDS web server and read it through OPeNDAP.  Ditto for reading the non-netCDF formats.  Today we are seeing some of the reverse; advances in CF gridspec and CF ugrid are taking place in the non-Java universe and leaving the Java side behind.  There's a need (and an opportunity) for a break-through in interoperability!
</p>

<p>
Hello Steve
</p>
<p>
I have been considering these topics over the last week and reading up on netCDF and the CDM.  
</p>
<p>
I think that where I have referred to netCDF in posts I have referred to the API, the CDM and the encoding, but primarily the API.  
</p>
<p>
My perspective on the world is that CF is currently a convention for using the netCDF API and storing information in netCDF files.  If we can deliver a data model specification then CF may be considered as an implementation neutral model with controlled terminologies.  In this case, netCDF is an implementation of CF, but one of potentially many.
</p>
<p>
This relationship between CF and netCDF could be characterised by saying:
</p>
<ul><li>CF is an implementation agnostic data model with a set of controlled terminologies.
</li><li>All CF concepts can be represented in netCDF, although netCDF may represent concepts outside of CF;
</li><li>CF provides a generalised way of modelling its concepts, along with a set of specialisations for how these may be used in netCDF.
</li></ul><p>
The conventions document exists for netCDF file encoding, perhaps further information would help for how the CF model interacts with netCDF's CDM.
</p>
<p>
As you have stated, there is a challenge in how to keep the communities and their tool sets connected.  I wonder if the development and maintenance of the abstracted CF model is the tool to do this, if approached correctly.  If each implementing community is able to keep in contact with the model, and show how it is doing so, then this could facilitate the cross fertilisation of ideas and concepts.
</p>
<p>
There may be an activity to develop further the aggregation rules that David has posted about, once the core model is in place; I see real value in doing this as a community activity, involving implementers from different tool development communities.
</p>
<p>
As an example, <a class="ext-link" href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/attachment/wiki/PotentialDataModelTypes/CDMimplementationCF1.5.png"><span class="icon">​</span>I have taken my sketch of a potential CF data model, and superimposed on it a number on constructs from the CDM</a>, to try and illustrate how an implementer might provide information on how their implementation works with the model.  I see such things as the responsibility of the implementers, but I say this on the assumption that implementers are also modellers (most of us possess many hats) involved in the data model development community.  
</p>
<p>
I think that if we keep the expectations of the model clear and keep talking them over, as we are doing, while allowing sufficient freedom and flexibility to implementations by modelling only what is required, then we can use this process to move implementation communities closer together.
</p>

This doesn't feel like identity to me.  There is no controlled terminology or definition, what you are describing feels to me like a reference, a fine detail of plumbing which doesn't need to be captured in a model, other than by referencing; UMl does this quite well without getting into specifics.

<p>
It is very similar, you are absolutely right; I would say the key difference is that the dim and dims boxes, defining 'qualified associations' are more loosely modelled than a DomainAxis construct, they are an instruction to an implementer to manage the association somehow, with little specification on how, only on what the outcome should be: a constrained relationship based on data-dimensions.  The key here is the constraint on the relationship, so that is all that is modelled.
</p>
<p>
I prefer this 'lighter touch' approach, reducing the complexity of the construct from a DomainAxis to a Coordinate (just a constrained AuxCoord).

If the model already exists, with a type I find unhelpful, I might also choose not to implement it, but I would be wary of doing so, as the modellers may be capturing something I don't understand, or that may be built upon in future iterations.  
</p>
<p>
However, we are in the situation where the model is being developed; I would be sad to see a Type I feel is unnecessary make its way into the model, only for me to ignore it and reimplement that relationship in a different way. I would have to think hard before taking this approach with an implementation. 
</p>
<p>
In this case I would like to keep the detail of modelling the relationship between a Field and the constrained Coordinates which define some or all of its degrees of freedom to a minimum.  I think that my approach does this by only defining that: 
</p>
<ul><li>a relationship exists to optionally define each of a Fields data dimensions; 
</li><li>the relationship constrains the number of defining Coordinates per data dimension to 1 or 0;
</li><li>the Coordinates are 1-dimensional, strictly monotonic, numerical ;
</li><li>Consistency between the Coordinate's length the length of the relevant Field's data dimension must exist;  
</li></ul><p>
I think there is value in doing this rather than defining a specific type which has these responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
I think the CF convention's description of scalar coordinates fits nicely into this approach, enabling any AuxCoord with one numerical value to be thought of as representing an uninstantiated data dimension. This becomes particularly useful when merging datasets together, all operations can be achieved by metadata inspection and promotion of suitable AuxCoord instances to Coordinates.

The CF Conventions for NetCDF files inherit their specification of Coordinate Variables from the NetCDF User Guide, although the CF phrasing is slightly stronger:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A Coordinate Variable is a one-dimensional variable with the same name as its dimension [e.g., time(time)], and it is defined as a numeric data type with values that are ordered monotonically. Missing values are not allowed in coordinate variables. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For the data model, is it sufficient to state that a Coordinate must be strictly monotonic?
</p>
<p>
This criteria mandates that there are no repeating values and an ordering process is available which has been used on the data.  As long as equality, greater than and less than operators are defined for a data type, a set of values may be monotonic, whether or not they are numeric. 
</p>
<p>
Am I missing something crucial here?
</p>
<p>
It seems a little over-prescriptive for the model to define that all Coordinates must be numeric to me.

Do we agree on this philosophy?:  our goal is not to be as general as possible, but instead to find the appropriate balance point between generality and simplicity.  (Finding the "appropriate balance point" requires us to articulate and weigh use cases.)

<p>
A case I have in mind is regarding the definition of correctly referenced dates.  
</p>
<p>
The CF Specification for NetCDF files has a particular approach to defining dates and times, which provides coordinates with numeric values, complex units and associated reference calendars.  I do not think this approach should be replicated as is in the data model.
</p>
<p>
I think the model can afford to be more generic, merely stating the requirements for dates and times and enabling many implementations of dates and times, as long as they support these requirements: dates, calendars, times, time-zones etc.
</p>
<p>
This keeps the data model at an appropriately high level, but it does cause a slight concern with data model Coordinates, if these are constrained to be numerical. 
</p>
<p>
My view on this is that if a Coordinate's data values are definitively sortable, then strict monotonicity can always be evaluated.  Thus we can constrain Coordinates to be strictly monotonic and one dimensional within the scope of the data model.
</p>
<p>
Whilst the allure of sorting strings exists, I understand the myriad of complications this can bring, so I can see why strings might be deemed not to be definitively sortable, while other things may be.

Cases like this that add complexity without adding expressive power should be evaluated against those pragmatic considerations.  Stated another way, there's a down side to new directions that you successfully pioneer in Python; they will either generate new requirements for writers of Java code and supporters of legacy applications or they will reduce interoperability.

Hi Mark, Steve:
</p>
<p>
I agree that arbitrary strings for coordinates is a big pain, and I wouldnt advise it. However, for the specific case for date/time, i would support ISO-8601 formatted strings (but not any ole' string) as datetime coordinates, as i have mentioned before. I think they are superior to "offset since &lt;date&gt;" that we have now. 
</p>
<p>
Note this would be a change from current "udunit only" dates. since we are nearing a proposal on modifying calendar attribute, its worth weighing a change in datetime representation.
</p>
<p>
(however i will be on vacation for 6 weeks, so cant say much more until after that)
</p>
<p>
regards,
John

Dear all
</p>
<p>
I think we should stick with numerically encoded dates. I would argue that support for strings as a means to specify date/times is a task for APIs, rather than that the standard should allow them. I agree with Mr Wet Blanket that it is more robust to keep the standard as simple as possible (but no simpler).

Absolutely agree.  The problems with using "offset since date" are legion, particularly in comparisons, and using ISO-8601 would hand many date problems to libraries. Which is not to say one couldn't keep doing offset date, but best practice should be to use ISO-8601 (which is why it's encoded as a standard) (except for wierd model calendars).

(Hi Brian.  We've had this discussion before.  :-) )
I agree on the up sides.  But we need to balance against the down sides:
</p>
<ol><li>"weird model calendars" are common in the climate community.  Is there a way to encode weird model calendars in ISO-8601?  If not then a client CF application would need to support both "offset since date" and ISO-8601 in order to avoid creating an interoperability breach.
</li><li>ditto bullet 1 for climatological time axes
</li><li>we should articulate and understand the "legion" problems of "offset since date" encoding.  I can think of 2 problems that come up over and over: i) using a mixed Gregorian-Julian calendar and crossing the 1541-ish boundary (do ISO-8601 libraries behave "scientifically" across this boundary?); ii) folks who lobby for units of "months" and "years" in order to reduce effort writing CF files (a relatively minor convenience issue).

Strictly speaking, ISO8601 only supports Gregorian dates.  The standard requires dates to be consecutive, so mixed <a class="missing wiki">Gregorian/Julian?</a> is disallowed (good!).  But you could still use a similar syntax (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.SSSZ) for other calendars, even "weird model ones" - they wouldn't be ISO8601, but they would be unambiguous if coupled with a "calendar" attribute.

<p>
Brian describes that <em>using ISO-8601 would hand many date problems to libraries</em>.  A big plus.  But presumably the encodings you propose would not be correctly interpreted by existing libraries and clients that use them.  Is there some community that has already done this?  Can you articulate a roll-out sequence for the use of ISO dates in CF that wouldn't create as many problems as it solves?  All strategies seem to lead to the need for applications to support BOTH time encodings or create a major breach in CF interoperability.  An application that support ISO but not "offset since date" could hardly be said to be "CF compliant".  
</p>
<p>
If there's a clean answer, it seems like it would have to lie in a significant "climate time test bed" activity that in the process wrote the code libraries and proposed climate enhancements to ISO-8601.

Just to clarify, I'm not pushing one way or the other for CF supporting strings as time axis elements - just stating the facts regarding ISO860l.  But, since you ask, here's what I might do if I <em>were</em> advocating for date strings:
</p>
<ol><li>Don't call them ISO8601 date strings.  That would define them to be Gregorian and might lead to the wrong results from existing ISO libraries.  Instead, give them another name, like "CF date strings" (which use an ISO-like syntax that we should define).
</li><li>Consider restricting the full ISO grammar (which allows for time periods, year-week syntax and partial time strings among other things), so that implementations only have to implement the parts that we really need in CF (I don't know exactly what these are, we'd need to think).
</li><li>The calendar attribute would of course be mandatory (or have some defined default).
</li></ol><p>
I don't know about Python, but the implementation of the above is already done in Java-land.  Both ncWMS and the Unidata CDM use the excellent joda-time libraries to implement date string parsing and formatting for all the CF calendars (I think).  However, I've never looked at climatological time axes.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps,
Jon

Is it your intention for this topic to apply only in the documentation of the data model, but not in the Python code?  (Which would already be a source of confusion ...)

</blockquote>
<p>
Absolutely, I think this topic must only apply to the documentation of the format independent data model.  Implementation discussions should be for context only.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it is time to close this ticket and open up a new child ticket with that scope explicitly defined to attempt to draw these discussions to a conclusion.  
</p>
<p>
(I fear this ticket has gone far beyond the scope of anyone reading it from start to end.)

I would like to second Mark here and suggest to close this ticket and organize the further discussion in at least two different streams. Ideally, the time between closing this ticket and opening new ones should be used to update the document (<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/cfdm.html"><span class="icon">​</span>http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/cfdm.html</a>) and associated information based on what seems to have come out of this discussion. That process would be very helpful to identify which aspects have been resolved and where is further discussion needed. 
</p>
<p>
On a more general line, I am wondering if it wouldn't be more productive to adopt the general CF philosophy of pragmatism and focus efforts first on the reference python implementation. This will certainly lead to specific design questions which should then be brought to light and discussed in context also of a language-independent data model. Of course this data model may then be somewhat less general, but it may therefore become simpler which is generally a good principle I find.

<p>
This illustrates my point.  I am not advocating a discussion here on how to represent time, instead I am advocating that the data model does not take on this question at all, it is for implementations to deal with.

<p>
I would like the model to merely state:
</p>

<p>
Dates and times, with respect to a variety of Calendars, may be defined as values (points and bounds) for Coordinates and AuxiliaryCoordinates.

<p>
 
(perhaps with an addendum to highlight aggregates of discontinuous bounded values such as climatologies if required).
</p>
<p>
If we can agree this we can save the discussion of date and time implementations for another day (I can hardly wait ;), the data model shouldn't define such details.

I second the idea of closing this ticket and making new tickets with a careful separation of implementation and data model.  Our current understanding of CF is that netCDF is the data model and all else is conventions -- i.e. the data model is *much* more general than the CF implementations. Your task in crafting a CF data model is to narrow that gap.  The point you've raised -- whether the abstract data model needs to stipulate that coordinate axes are numeric -- is a valid point to consider.
</p>
<p>
You've probably noticed that Jonathan and I come from different philosophical camps on these discussions.  My position is that the design-by-committee standards process often leads to standards that are too complex -- often much too complex.  CF is significantly too complex already.  When weighing topics that seem "nice" or "general" or "potentially useful" but no one is articulating a practical need for them, I believe the jury (ourselves) should be instructed to weigh those topics using a "guilty until proven innocent" guideline.  That is our bulwark against creeping complexity.

On the basis I have attempted to summarise the current status in a new ticket <a class="new ticket" href="./95.html" title="task: Development of CF 1.5 Data Model (new)">#95</a>, I hope I haven't acted too hastily.
</p>

Perhaps we can move the relevant discussions there and attempt to finalise the details for Data Model 1.5.

I agree: if the model is to be useful it must drive at simplicity, <strong>just enough specification to enable interoperability</strong> seems a good mental objective to me.

My view on approach is the opposite, I think we get more benefit from focussing attention on the data model.  
</p>
<p>
I agree with your desire for simplicity; I restate: I think we must strive to make the data model as simple as possible whilst still being useful.

Hello,
</p>
<p>
It will be useful to read the latest draft of the <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~david/cfdm_recast.html"><span class="icon">​</span>data model</a>, which incorporates many of the points raised in this discussion. There is also a UML diagram of it (see the attachments of this ticket). I encourage you to have a glance at it - it should help to refocus our efforts.
</p>
<p>
The most recent changes are highlighted in this document, but not all changes since version 0.1. However, the highlighted bits are mainly the areas that have changed since the very beginning.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks,
</p>
<p>
David
