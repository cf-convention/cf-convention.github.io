The definitions and/or documentation for 3 grid mappings cause confusion and inconsistency when translating to/from WKT.
</p>
<p>
This ticket is the result of a discussion in the mailing list: <a class="ext-link" href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2011/027605.html"><span class="icon">â€‹</span>http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2011/027605.html</a> .
</p>
<p>
Here is a summary of suggested changes:
</p>
<p>
1) lambert_conformal_conic
</p>
<p>
The 1SP (1 standard_parallel) case is not properly documented. There should be a link to <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/lambert_conic_conformal_1sp.html"><span class="icon">â€‹</span>http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/lambert_conic_conformal_1sp.html</a> and mention that latitude_of_projection_origin==standard_parallel (and the WKT "Scale factor at natural origin" = 1). 
</p>
<p>
In the case that scale_factor is not 1, then the 2SP version should be used (as scale_factor is not part of this projection's parameters in CF).
</p>
<p>
Also, the EPSG codes should included in "Notes" (9801 for 1SP and 9802 for 2SP).
</p>
<p>
2) lambert_cylindrical_equal_area
</p>
<p>
The scale_factor_at_projection_origin variant has no WKT nor PROJ.4 equivalent (they both require standard_parallel) and there are no known examples using this variant. It should be dropped from the CF spec, or at least deprecated.
</p>
<p>
3) polar_stereographic
</p>
<p>
The 2 variants (standard_parallel or scale_factor_at_projection_origin) are not well documented. 
</p>
<p>
The standard_parallel variant corresponds to EPSG Polar Stereographic (Variant B) (EPSG dataset coordinate operation method code 9829), while the scale_factor_at_projection_origin variant corresponds to EPSG Polar Stereographic (Variant A) (EPSG dataset coordinate operation method code 9810).  
</p>
<p>
This information should be included in the "Map parameters" and "Notes" sections, to be consistent with other definitions such as mercator.

I would like to prepare addditional documentation on how to relate the CF parameters to PROJ.4 an WKT parameters, should this be in a wiki entry?

OR:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">Map parameters:

3) polar_stereographic

</p>
<p>
The standard_parallel variant corresponds to EPSG Polar Stereographic (Variant B) (EPSG dataset coordinate operation method code 9829), while the scale_factor_at_projection_origin variant corresponds to EPSG Polar Stereographic (Variant A) (EPSG dataset coordinate operation method code 9810). As PROJ.4 requires the standard parallel, [Snyder] formula 21-7 can be used to compute it from the scale factor if needed.

<p>
I agree that this needs addressing
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The notes are useful clarification.  I do wonder whether the two separate approaches lend themselves to two different grid_mappings, rather than one, with two options about how to define SP and conditional behaviour for scale_factor 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
Also, the EPSG codes should included in "Notes" (9801 for 1SP and 9802 for 2SP).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I thought that EPSG codes referred to specific instances of projections, not projection definitions.  Is the intention of this inclusion that a specific projection instance is referenced?
 
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">

2) lambert_cylindrical_equal_area

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 
I agree, this attribute should be deprecated or preferably dropped.  I have not found a way of interpreting this attribute in the context of a Lambert Cylindrical Projection.
</p>
<p>
The definition implies one or other is required.  Is this change suggesting that standard_parallel is essential for such a grid_mapping?
</p>
<p>
If so, is there a usable default value that could be included?
</p>

Notes:

Notes on using the PROJ.4 software package for computing the mapping may be found at http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/polar_stereographic.html.

The standard_parallel variant corresponds to EPSG Polar Stereographic (Variant B) (EPSG dataset coordinate operation method code 9829), while the scale_factor_at_projection_origin variant corresponds to EPSG Polar Stereographic (Variant A) (EPSG dataset coordinate operation method code 9810). As PROJ.4 requires the standard parallel, [Snyder] formula 21-7 can be used to compute it from the scale factor if needed.

<p>
On one side, this is in line with other conventions/software which separate the 1SP and 2SP in different definitions.  In the case of Mercator, EPSG and OGC also have 2 definitions, but they are functionally equivalent.
</p>
<p>
However, how to deal with backwards-compatibility and which names should be used for the two variants in CF? I see a high potential for disruption here. I still think it would be simpler to just amend the docs as I proposed, which would remove these two problem.

Proj.4 is quite a good software, and it's referenced pretty much in all the projections...

Notes:

Notes on using the PROJ.4 software package for computing the mapping may be found at http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/polar_stereographic.html.

The standard_parallel variant corresponds to EPSG Polar Stereographic (Variant B) (EPSG dataset coordinate operation method code 9829), while the scale_factor_at_projection_origin variant corresponds to EPSG Polar Stereographic (Variant A) (EPSG dataset coordinate operation method code 9810). As PROJ.4 requires the standard parallel, [Snyder] formula 21-7 can be used to compute it from the scale factor if needed.

On one side, this is in line with other conventions/software which separate the 1SP and 2SP in different definitions.  In the case of Mercator, EPSG and OGC also have 2 definitions, but they are functionally equivalent.
</p>
<p>
However, how to deal with backwards-compatibility and which names should be used for the two variants in CF? I see a high potential for disruption here. I still think it would be simpler to just amend the docs as I proposed, which would remove these two problem.

I agree, this attribute should be deprecated or preferably dropped.  I have not found a way of interpreting this attribute in the context of a Lambert Cylindrical Projection.

<p>
if the software we use cannot interpret it, I question its usefulness.  I don't think this should be included unless we have good reason to and we understand how to interpret it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I'm not sure I understand - your opinion is that this change should not be included, or that the scale_factor_at_projection_origin variant should not be included?
</p>
<p>
If your answer is the former here is my answer: 
</p>
<p>
Proj.4 is quite a good software, and it's referenced pretty much in all the projections...
</p>
<p>
I merely included this for clarity. The current CF spec is vague about why you would use standard_parallel or scale_factor_at_projection_origin and this should be clarified. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
apologies for my lack of clarity.  I agree with your assessment of Proj4, my concern is allowing a parameterisation which is not supported by our primary software tools such as proj4 and OGR.
</p>
<p>
My preference would be that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the scale_factor_at_projection_origin variant should not be included
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
but that the rest of the change should be included as described here.
</p>
<p>
However I am not so strongly of this view that I want to hold up this ticket any further.  If including the scale_factor_at_projection_origin variant is helpful in your view, then I think it can be managed, but I am struggling to see it's usefulness if the libraries I know of do not interpret it.

It would be nice to have John Caron's opinion about this. From his response in <a class="ext-link" href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2011/049568.html"><span class="icon">â€‹</span>http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2011/049568.html</a> he seems to find it important to keep it.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">snyder 21-7 gives the formula for the scale factor, which can easily be 
inverted to derive the "standard_parallel" which i think just means the 
latitude at which the scale factor = 1. Thats why in CF you give one or 
the other.  so my guess is that the OGC is specifying redundant info.

GRIB-1 has "Grid lengths are in units of metres, at the 60-degree 
parallel nearest to the pole on the projection plane." If one uses 21-7 
to compute the scale factor at the pole that makes scale factor = 1 at 
60 degress, one gets 0.9330127018922193. use this for GRIB-1 GDS=5, and 
lo! the pictures look correct. GRIB-2 allows the user to specify and 
wowwa! they often have 0.933.
</pre><p>
In any case, even though Proj.4 does not support that variant, [Snyder] formula 21-7  allows to calculate it. I have included that in my provisional gdal netcdf driver code.
