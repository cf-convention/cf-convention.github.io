  <entry id="primary_and_secondary_land">
    <description>"Primary and secondary land" is land that is not in use as crop land or pasture land, including forests, grasslands, bare ground and vegetated wetlands. "Primary land" is land that has not undergone lulcc (land use or land cover change) due to human disturbance. "Secondary land" is land that has previously been used for agriculture, urban development or logging and has subsequently been abandoned. Reference: Hurtt et al. (2011), Climatic Change, 109 - 117, Harmonization of land-use scenarios for the period 1500â€“2100: 600 years of global gridded annual land-use transitions, wood harvest, and resulting secondary lands, doi: 10.1007/s10584-011-0153-2. "Primary and secondary land" refers to land use or management, rather than to specific categories of vegetation cover, e.g. the primary and secondary succession of plant species.</description>

  <entry id="sea_ice_ridges">
    <description>Sea ice "ridging" occurs in rough sea conditions. The motion of the sea surface can cause areas of sea ice to deform and fold resulting in ridged upper and lower surfaces. The ridges can be as much as twenty metres thick if thick ice is deformed.</description>
  </entry>
  <entry id="sea_ice_melt_pond">
    <description>The area classified as type "sea_ice" within a grid cell is unaltered when an area of type "sea_ice_melt_pond" is also present because melt ponds occur on top of the existing sea ice.</description>

  <entry id="secondary_deciduous_trees">
    <description>A secondary forest is a forest that has been logged and has recovered naturally or artificially. Reference: 'Report of the ad hoc technical expert group on forest biological diversity', United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, www.cbd.int/forest/definitions.shtml.
