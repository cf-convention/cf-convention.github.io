			No variable or dimension names are standardized
			by this convention. Instead we follow the lead
			of the NUG
			and standardize only the names
			of attributes and some of the values taken by
			those attributes. The overview provided in this
			section will be followed with more complete
			descriptions in following sections. 
			<a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Attributes">Appendix A, <i>Attributes</i></a>
			contains a summary of all the attributes used
			in this convention.
		</p><p>
			We recommend that the NUG defined attribute
			<code class="varname">Conventions</code>
			be given the string value "<code class="varname">CF-1.0</code>"
			to identify datasets that conform to these
			conventions.
		</p><p>
			The general description of a file's contents
			should be contained in the following attributes:
			<code class="varname">title</code>, 
			<code class="varname">history</code>, 
			<code class="varname">institution</code>, 
			<code class="varname">source</code>, 
			<code class="varname">comment</code>
			and 
			<code class="varname">references</code>
			(<a class="xref" href="ch02s06.html#description-of-file-contents" title="2.6.2. Description of file contents">Section 2.6.2, &#8220;Description of file contents&#8221;</a>). 
			For backwards compatibility with COARDS none
			of these attributes is required, but their
			use is recommended to provide human readable
			documentation of the file contents.
		</p><p>
			Each variable in a netCDF file has an associated
			description which is provided by the attributes
			<code class="varname">units</code>,
			<code class="varname">long_name</code>, and
			<code class="varname">standard_name</code>. The
			<code class="varname">units</code>,
			and <code class="varname">long_name</code>
			attributes are defined in the NUG and the
			<code class="varname">standard_name</code> attribute is
			defined in this document.
		</p><p>
			The 
			<code class="varname">units</code> 
			attribute is required for all variables
			that represent dimensional quantities (except for
			boundary variables defined in 
			<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#cell-boundaries" title="7.1. Cell Boundaries">Section 7.1, &#8220;Cell Boundaries&#8221;</a>. 
			The values of the 
			<code class="varname">units</code> 
			attributes are character
			strings that are recognized by UNIDATA's Udunits
			package 
			[<span class="citation"><a class="link" href="bi01.html#udunits" title="UDUNITS Software Package">UDUNITS</a></span>],
			(with exceptions allowed as discussed in
			<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#units" title="3.1. Units">Section 3.1, &#8220;Units&#8221;</a>). 
		</p><p>
			The 
			<code class="varname">long_name</code> 
			and 
			<code class="varname">standard_name</code> 
			attributes are
			used to describe the content of each variable. For
			backwards compatibility with COARDS neither
			is required, but use of at least one of them
			is strongly recommended. The use of standard
			names will facilitate the exchange of climate
			and forecast data by providing unambiguous
			identification of variables most commonly
			analyzed.
		</p><p>
			Four types of coordinates receive special
			treatment by these conventions: latitude,
			longitude, vertical, and time. Every variable
			must have associated metadata that allows
			identification of each such coordinate that is
			relevant. Two independent parts of the convention
			allow this to be done. There are conventions that
			identify the variables that contain the coordinate
			data, and there are conventions that identify
			the type of coordinate represented by that data.
		</p><p>
			There are two methods used to identify variables
			that contain coordinate data. The first is to
			use the NUG-defined "coordinate variables." <span class="emphasis"><em>The
			use of coordinate variables is required for all
			dimensions that correspond to one dimensional
			space or time coordinates</em></span>. In cases where
			coordinate variables are not applicable,
			the variables containing coordinate data are
			identified by the 
			<code class="varname">coordinates</code> 
			attribute.
		</p><p>
			Once the variables containing coordinate data are
			identified, further conventions are required to
			determine the type of coordinate represented by
			each of these variables. Latitude, longitude,
			and time coordinates are identified solely by
			the value of their 
			<code class="varname">units</code>
			attribute. Vertical
			coordinates with units of pressure may also
			be identified by the 
			<code class="varname">units</code> 
			attribute. Other
			vertical coordinates must use the attribute
			<code class="varname">positive</code>
			which determines whether the direction of
			increasing coordinate value is up or down. Because
			identification of a coordinate type by its units
			involves the use of an external software package
			[<a href="bi01.html#udunits" class="biblioref" title="[UDUNITS]"><abbr class="abbrev">UDUNITS</abbr></a>],
			we provide the optional attribute
			<code class="varname">axis</code>
			for a direct identification of coordinates
			that correspond to latitude, longitude, vertical,
			or time axes.
		</p><p>
			Latitude, longitude, and time are defined
			by internationally recognized standards,
			and hence, identifying the coordinates of
			these types is sufficient to locate data
			values uniquely with respect to time and a
			point on the earth's surface. On the other
			hand identifying the vertical coordinate is
			not necessarily sufficient to locate a data
			value vertically with respect to the earth's
			surface. In particular a model may output data
			on the dimensionless vertical coordinate used
			in its mathematical formulation. To achieve the
			goal of being able to spatially locate all data
			values, this convention includes the definitions
			of common dimensionless vertical coordinates in
			<a class="xref" href="apd.html" title="Appendix D. Dimensionless Vertical Coordinates">Appendix D, <i>Dimensionless Vertical Coordinates</i></a>. 
			These definitions provide a mapping
			between the dimensionless coordinate values
			and dimensional values that can be uniquely
			located with respect to a point on the earth's
			surface. The definitions are associated with
			a coordinate variable via the 
			<code class="varname">standard_name</code>
			and 
			<code class="varname">formula_terms</code>
			attributes. For backwards
			compatibility with COARDS use of these attributes
			is not required, but is strongly recommended.
		</p><p>
			It is often the case that data values are not
			representative of single points in time and/or
			space, but rather of intervals or multidimensional
			cells. This convention defines a 
			<code class="varname">bounds</code>
			attribute
			to specify the extent of intervals or cells. When
			data that is representative of cells can be
			described by simple statistical methods, those
			methods can be indicated using the 
			<code class="varname">cell_methods</code>
			attribute. An important application of this
			attribute is to describe climatological and
			diurnal statistics.
		</p><p>
			Methods for reducing the total volume of data
			include both packing and compression. Packing
			reduces the data volume by reducing the precision
			of the stored numbers. It is implemented using
			the attributes 
			<code class="varname">add_offset</code> 
			and 
			<code class="varname">scale_factor</code> 
			which
			are defined in the NUG. Compression on the other
			hand loses no precision, but reduces the volume by
			not storing missing data. The attribute 
			<code class="varname">compress</code>
			is defined for this purpose.
