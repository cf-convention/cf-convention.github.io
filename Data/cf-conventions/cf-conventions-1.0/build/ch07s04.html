			Climatological statistics may be derived from
			corresponding portions of the annual cycle
			in a set of years, e.g., the average January
			temperatures in the climatology of 1961-1990,
			where the values are derived by averaging the 30
			Januarys from the separate years. Portions of the
			climatological cycle are specified by references
			to dates within the calendar year. However,
			a calendar year is not a well-defined unit of
			time, because it differs between leap years and
			other years, and among calendars. Nonetheless for
			practical purposes we wish to compare statistics
			for months or seasons from different calendars,
			and to make climatologies from a mixture of leap
			years and other years. Hence we provide special
			conventions for indicating dates within the
			climatological year. Climatological statistics
			may also be derived from corresponding portions
			of a range of days, for instance the average
			temperature for each hour of the average day in
			April 1997. In addition the two concepts may
			be used at once, for instance to indicate not
			April 1997, but the average April of the five
			years 1995-1999.
		</p><p>
			Climatological variables have a climatological
			time axis. Like an ordinary time axis, a
			climatological time axis may have a dimension
			of unity (for example, a variable containing the
			January average temperatures for 1961-1990), but
			often it will have several elements (for example,
			a climatological time axis with a dimension of
			12 for the climatological average temperatures in
			each month for 1961-1990, a dimension of 3 for the
			January mean temperatures for the three decades
			1961-1970, 1971-1980, 1981-1990, or a dimension of
			24 for the hours of an average day). Intervals of
			climatological time are conceptually different
			from ordinary time intervals; a given interval
			of climatological time represents a set
			of subintervals which are not necessarily
			contiguous. To indicate this difference, a
			climatological time coordinate variable does
			not have a 
			<code class="varname">bounds</code> 
			attribute. Instead, it has a
			<code class="varname">climatology</code>
			attribute, which names a variable
			with dimensions (n,2), n being the dimension of
			the climatological time axis. Using the units and
			calendar of the time coordinate variable, element
			(i,0) of the climatology variable specifies the
			beginning of the first subinterval and element
			(i,1) the end of the last subinterval used to
			evaluate the climatological statistics with index
			i in the time dimension. The time coordinates
			should be values that are representative
			of the climatological time intervals, such
			that an application which does not recognise
			climatological time will nonetheless be able to
			make a reasonable interpretation.
		</p><p>
			The COARDS standard offers limited support
			for climatological time. For compatibility with
			COARDS, time coordinates should also be recognised
			as climatological if they have a 
			<code class="varname">units</code>
			attribute
			of time-units relative to midnight on 1 January
			in year 0 i.e. <code class="varname">since 0-1-1</code> in udunits syntax , and
			provided they refer to the real-world calendar. We
			do not recommend this convention because (a)
			it does not provide any information about the
			intervals used to compute the climatology, and
			(b) there is no standard for how dates since year
			1 will be encoded with units having a reference
			time in year 0, since this year does not exist;
			consequently there may be inconsistencies among
			software packages in the interpretation of the
			time coordinates. Year 0 may be a valid year in
			non-real-world calendars, and therefore cannot be
			used to signal climatological time in such cases.
		</p><p>
			A climatological axis may use different
			statistical methods to represent variation among
			years, within years and within days. For example,
			the average January temperature in a climatology
			is obtained by averaging both within years and
			over years. This is different from the average
			January-maximum temperature and the maximum
			January-average temperature. For the former,
			we first calculate the maximum temperature in
			each January, then average these maxima; for the
			latter, we first calculate the average temperature
			in each January, then find the largest one. As
			usual, the statistical operations are recorded
			in the 
			<code class="varname">cell_methods</code>
			attribute, which may have
			two or three entries for the climatological
			time dimension.
		</p><p>
			Valid values of the 
			<code class="varname">cell_methods</code> attribute must be
			in one of the forms from the following list. The
			intervals over which various statistical methods
			are applied are determined by decomposing the date
			and time specifications of the climatological time
			bounds of a cell, as recorded in the variable
			named by the 
			<code class="varname">climatology</code>
			attribute. (The date
			and time specifications must be calculated from
			the time coordinates expressed in units of "time
			interval since reference date and time".) In the
			descriptions that follow we use the abbreviations
			<span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>,

            and <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> for year, month, day, hour,

			The methods which can be specified are those
			listed in <a class="xref" href="ape.html" title="Appendix E. Cell Methods">Appendix E, <i>Cell Methods</i></a> and each entry in the
			<code class="varname">cell_methods</code>
			attribute may also, as usual, contain
			non-standardised information in parentheses after
			the method. For instance, a mean over ENSO years
			might be indicated by 
			"<code class="computeroutput">time: mean over years (ENSO years)</code>".
		</p><p>
			When considering intervals within years, if the
			earlier climatological time bound is later in the
			year than the later climatological time bound, it
			implies that the time intervals for the individual
			years run from each year across January 1 into the
			next year e.g. DJF intervals run from December 1
			0:00 to March 1 0:00. Analogous situations arise
			for daily intervals running across midnight from
			one day to the next.
		</p><p>
			When considering intervals within days, if the
			earlier time of day is equal to the later time
			of day, then the method is applied to a full 24
			hour day.
