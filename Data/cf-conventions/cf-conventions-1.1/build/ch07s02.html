			For some calculations, information is needed
			about the size, shape or location of the cells
			that cannot be deduced from the coordinates and
			bounds without special knowledge that a generic
			application cannot be expected to have. For
			instance, in computing the mean of several cell
			values, it is often appropriate to "weight" the
			values by area. When computing an area-mean each
			grid cell value is multiplied by the grid-cell
			area before summing, and then the sum is divided
			by the sum of the grid-cell areas. Area weights
			may also be needed to map data from one grid to
			another in such a way as to preserve the area
			mean of the field. The preservation of area-mean
			values while regridding may be essential, for
			example, when calculating surface heat fluxes
			in an atmospheric model with a grid that differs
			from the ocean model grid to which it is coupled.
		</p><p>
			In many cases the areas can be calculated from the
			cell bounds, but there are exceptions. Consider,
			for example, a spherical geodesic grid composed
			of contiguous, roughly hexagonal cells. The
			vertices of the cells can be stored in the
			variable identified by the 
			<code class="varname">bounds </code> 
			attribute,
			but the cell perimeter is not uniquely defined
			by its vertices (because the vertices could, for
			example, be connected by straight lines, or, on
			a sphere, by lines following a great circle, or,
			in general, in some other way). Thus, given the
			cell vertices alone, it is generally impossible
			to calculate the area of a grid cell. This is
			why it may be necessary to store the grid-cell
			areas in addition to the cell vertices.
		</p><p>
			In other cases, the grid cell-volume might be
			needed and might not be easily calculated from
			the coordinate information. In ocean models, for
			example, it is not uncommon to find "partial" grid
			cells at the bottom of the ocean. In this case,
			rather than (or in addition to) indicating grid
			cell area, it may be necessary to indicate volume.
		</p><p>
			To indicate extra information about the
			spatial properties of a variable's grid cells,
			a 
			<code class="varname">cell_measures</code> 
			attribute may be defined for a
			variable. This is a string attribute comprising
			a list of blank-separated pairs of words of the
			form "<code class="varname">measure: name</code>".
            For the moment, "<code class="varname">area</code>" and
			"<code class="varname">volume</code>" are the only defined measures, but others
			may be supported in future. The "name" is the name
			of the variable containing the measure values,
			which we refer to as a "measure variable". The
			dimensions of the measure variable should be
			the same as or a subset of the dimensions of
			the variable to which they are related, but
			their order is not restricted. In the case of
			area, for example, the field itself might be a
			function of longitude, latitude, and time, but
			the variable containing the area values would
			only include longitude and latitude dimensions
			(and the dimension order could be reversed,
			although this is not recommended). The variable
			must have a 
			<code class="varname">units</code>
			attribute and may have other
			attributes such as a 
			<code class="varname">standard_name</code>.
		</p><p>
			For rectangular longitude-latitude grids, the
			area of grid cells can be calculated from the
			bounds: the area of a cell is proportional to the
			product of the difference in the longitude bounds
			of the cell and the difference between the sine
			of each latitude bound of the cell. In this case
			supplying grid-cell areas via the 
			<code class="varname">cell_measures</code>
			attribute is unnecessary because it may be assumed
			that applications can perform this calculation,
			using their own value for the radius of the Earth.
