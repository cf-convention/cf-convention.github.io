		<title>Goals</title>
		<para>
			The NetCDF library <biblioref linkend="netcdf"/> is 
            designed to read
			and write data that has been structured according
			to well-defined rules and is easily ported across
			various computer platforms. The netCDF interface
			enables but does not require the creation of
			<emphasis>self-describing</emphasis> datasets. 
            The purpose of the CF
			conventions is to require conforming datasets
			to contain sufficient metadata that they are
			self-describing in the sense that each variable
			in the file has an associated description of
			what it represents, including physical units if
			appropriate, and that each value can be located
			in space (relative to earth-based coordinates)
			and time.
		</para>
		<para>
			An important benefit of a convention is that it
			enables software tools to display data and perform
			operations on specified subsets of the data
			with minimal user intervention. It is possible
			to provide the metadata describing how a field
			is located in time and space in many different
			ways that a human would immediately recognize as
			equivalent. The purpose in restricting how the
			metadata is represented is to make it practical
			to write software that allows a machine to parse
			that metadata and to automatically associate each
			data value with its location in time and space. It
			is equally important that the metadata be easy
			for human users to write and to understand.
		</para>
		<para>
			This standard is intended for use with climate
			and forecast data, for atmosphere, surface and
			ocean, and was designed with model-generated data
			particularly in mind. We recognise that there are
			limits to what a standard can practically cover;
			we restrict ourselves to issues that we believe to
			be of common and frequent concern in the design of
			climate and forecast metadata. Our main purpose
			therefore, is to propose a clear, adequate and
			flexible definition of the metadata needed for
			climate and forecast data. Although this is
			specifically a netCDF standard, we feel that
			most of the ideas are of wider application. The
			metadata objects could be contained in file
			formats other than netCDF. Conversion of the
			metadata between files of different formats will
			be facilitated if conventions for all formats
			are based on similar ideas.
		</para>
		<para>
			This convention is designed to be backward
			compatible with the COARDS conventions <biblioref linkend="coards"/>,
			by which we mean that a conforming COARDS dataset
			also conforms to the CF standard. Thus new
			applications that implement the CF conventions
			will be able to process COARDS datasets.
		</para>
		<para>
			We have also striven to maximize conformance
			to the COARDS standard, that is, wherever the
			COARDS metadata conventions provide an adequate
			description we require their use. Extensions to
			COARDS are implemented in a manner such that the
			content that doesn't depend on the extensions
			is still accessible to applications that adhere
			to the COARDS standard.

		<title>Terminology</title>
		<para>
			The terms in this document that refer to
			components of a netCDF file are defined in the

					<listitem>
						<para>
							Any netCDF variable that contains

		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
			No variable or dimension names are standardized
			by this convention. Instead we follow the lead
			of the NUG
			and standardize only the names
			of attributes and some of the values taken by
			those attributes. The overview provided in this
			section will be followed with more complete
			descriptions in following sections. 
			<xref linkend="attribute-appendix"/>
			contains a summary of all the attributes used
			in this convention.
		</para>
		<para>
			We recommend that the NUG defined attribute
			<varname>Conventions</varname>
			be given the string value 
                        <emphasis role="deletedtext">"<varname>CF-1.0</varname>"</emphasis>
                        <emphasis role="newtext">"<varname>CF-1.1</varname>"</emphasis>
			to identify datasets that conform to these
			conventions.
		</para>
		<para>
			The general description of a file's contents
			should be contained in the following attributes:
			<varname>title</varname>, 
			<varname>history</varname>, 
			<varname>institution</varname>, 
			<varname>source</varname>, 
			<varname>comment</varname>
			and 
			<varname>references</varname>
			(<xref linkend="description-of-file-contents"/>). 
			For backwards compatibility with COARDS none
			of these attributes is required, but their
			use is recommended to provide human readable
			documentation of the file contents.
		</para>
		<para>
			Each variable in a netCDF file has an associated
			description which is provided by the attributes
			<varname>units</varname>,
			<varname>long_name</varname>, and
			<varname>standard_name</varname>. The
			<varname>units</varname>,
			and <varname>long_name</varname>
			attributes are defined in the NUG and the
			<varname>standard_name</varname> attribute is
			defined in this document.
		</para>
		<para>
			The 
			<varname>units</varname> 
			attribute is required for all variables
			that represent dimensional quantities (except for
			boundary variables defined in 
			<xref linkend="cell-boundaries"/>. 
			The values of the 
			<varname>units</varname> 
			attributes are character
			strings that are recognized by UNIDATA's Udunits
			package 
			<citation><link linkend="udunits">UDUNITS</link></citation>,
			(with exceptions allowed as discussed in
			<xref linkend="units"/>). 
		</para>
		<para>
			The 
			<varname>long_name</varname> 
			and 
			<varname>standard_name</varname> 
			attributes are
			used to describe the content of each variable. For
			backwards compatibility with COARDS neither
			is required, but use of at least one of them
			is strongly recommended. The use of standard
			names will facilitate the exchange of climate
			and forecast data by providing unambiguous
			identification of variables most commonly
			analyzed.
		</para>
		<para>
			Four types of coordinates receive special
			treatment by these conventions: latitude,
			longitude, vertical, and time. Every variable
			must have associated metadata that allows
			identification of each such coordinate that is
			relevant. Two independent parts of the convention
			allow this to be done. There are conventions that
			identify the variables that contain the coordinate
			data, and there are conventions that identify
			the type of coordinate represented by that data.
		</para>
		<para>
			There are two methods used to identify variables
			that contain coordinate data. The first is to
			use the NUG-defined "coordinate variables." <emphasis>The
			use of coordinate variables is required for all
			dimensions that correspond to one dimensional
			space or time coordinates</emphasis>. In cases where
			coordinate variables are not applicable,
			the variables containing coordinate data are
			identified by the 
			<varname>coordinates</varname> 
			attribute.
		</para>
		<para>
			Once the variables containing coordinate data are
			identified, further conventions are required to
			determine the type of coordinate represented by
			each of these variables. Latitude, longitude,
			and time coordinates are identified solely by
			the value of their 
			<varname>units</varname>
			attribute. Vertical
			coordinates with units of pressure may also
			be identified by the 
			<varname>units</varname> 
			attribute. Other
			vertical coordinates must use the attribute
			<varname>positive</varname>
			which determines whether the direction of
			increasing coordinate value is up or down. Because
			identification of a coordinate type by its units
			involves the use of an external software package
			<biblioref linkend="udunits" />,
			we provide the optional attribute
			<varname>axis</varname>
			for a direct identification of coordinates
			that correspond to latitude, longitude, vertical,
			or time axes.
		</para>
		<para>
			Latitude, longitude, and time are defined
			by internationally recognized standards,
			and hence, identifying the coordinates of
			these types is sufficient to locate data
			values uniquely with respect to time and a
			point on the earth's surface. On the other
			hand identifying the vertical coordinate is
			not necessarily sufficient to locate a data
			value vertically with respect to the earth's
			surface. In particular a model may output data
			on the dimensionless vertical coordinate used
			in its mathematical formulation. To achieve the
			goal of being able to spatially locate all data
			values, this convention includes the definitions
			of common dimensionless vertical coordinates in
			<xref linkend="dimensionless-v-coord"/>. 
			These definitions provide a mapping
			between the dimensionless coordinate values
			and dimensional values that can be uniquely
			located with respect to a point on the earth's
			surface. The definitions are associated with
			a coordinate variable via the 
			<varname>standard_name</varname>
			and 
			<varname>formula_terms</varname>
			attributes. For backwards
			compatibility with COARDS use of these attributes
			is not required, but is strongly recommended.
		</para>
		<para>
			It is often the case that data values are not
			representative of single points in time and/or
			space, but rather of intervals or multidimensional
			cells. This convention defines a 
			<varname>bounds</varname>
			attribute
			to specify the extent of intervals or cells. When
			data that is representative of cells can be
			described by simple statistical methods, those
			methods can be indicated using the 
			<varname>cell_methods</varname>
			attribute. An important application of this
			attribute is to describe climatological and
			diurnal statistics.
		</para>
		<para>
			Methods for reducing the total volume of data
			include both packing and compression. Packing
			reduces the data volume by reducing the precision
			of the stored numbers. It is implemented using
			the attributes 
			<varname>add_offset</varname> 
			and 
			<varname>scale_factor</varname> 
			which
			are defined in the NUG. Compression on the other
			hand loses no precision, but reduces the volume by
			not storing missing data. The attribute 
			<varname>compress</varname>
			is defined for this purpose.
		</para>

	<section id="coards-relationship">
		<title>Relationship to the COARDS Conventions</title>
		<para>
			These conventions generalize and extend the
			COARDS conventions 
			<biblioref linkend="coards"/>. 
			A major design goal
			has been to maintain <emphasis>backward compatibility</emphasis> with
			COARDS. Hence applications written to process
			datasets that conform to these conventions
			will also be able to process COARDS conforming
			datasets. We have also striven to maximize
			<emphasis>conformance</emphasis> to the COARDS standard so that
			datasets that only require the metadata that was
			available under COARDS will still be able to be
			processed by COARDS conforming applications. But
			because of the extensions that provide new
			metadata content, and the relaxation of some
			COARDS requirements, datasets that conform
			to these conventions will not necessarily
			be recognized by applications that adhere to
			the COARDS conventions. The features of these
			conventions that allow writing netCDF files that
			are not COARDS conforming are summarized below.
		</para>
		<para>
			COARDS standardizes the description of grids
			composed of independent latitude, longitude,
			vertical, and time axes. In addition
			to standardizing the metadata required to
			identify each of these axis types COARDS
			restricts the axis (equivalently dimension)
			ordering to be longitude, latitude, vertical,
			and time (with longitude being the most rapidly
			varying dimension). Because of I/O performance
			considerations it may not be possible for models
			to output their data in conformance with the
			COARDS requirement. The CF convention places no
			rigid restrictions on the order of dimensions,
			however we encourage data producers to make the
			extra effort to stay within the COARDS standard
			order. The use of non-COARDS axis ordering will
			render files inaccessible to some applications
			and limit interoperability. Often a buffering
			operation can be used to miminize performance
			penalties when axis ordering in model code does
			not match the axis ordering of a COARDS file.
		</para>
		<para>
			COARDS addresses the issue of identifying
			dimensionless vertical coordinates, but does
			not provide any mechanism for mapping the
			dimensionless values to dimensional ones that
			can be located with respect to the earth's
			surface. For backwards compatibility we continue
			to allow (but do not require) the 
			<varname>units</varname>
			attribute of dimensionless vertical coordinates to take the
			values "level", "layer", or "sigma_level." But we
			recommend that the 
			<varname>standard_name</varname> and 
			<varname>formula_terms</varname>
			attributes be used to identify the appropriate
			definition of the dimensionless vertical
			coordinate (see 
			<xref linkend="dimensionless-vertical-coordinate"/>).
		</para>
		<para>
			The CF conventions define attributes which
			enable the description of data properties
			that are outside the scope of the COARDS
			conventions. These new attributes do not violate
			the COARDS conventions, but applications that
			only recognize COARDS conforming datasets will not
			have the capabilities that the new attributes are
			meant to enable. Briefly the new attributes allow:
