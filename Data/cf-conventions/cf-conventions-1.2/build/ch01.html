			The NetCDF library [<a href="bi01.html#netcdf" class="biblioref" title="[NetCDF]"><abbr class="abbrev">NetCDF</abbr></a>] is 
            designed to read
			and write data that has been structured according
			to well-defined rules and is easily ported across
			various computer platforms. The netCDF interface
			enables but does not require the creation of
			<span class="emphasis"><em>self-describing</em></span> datasets. 
            The purpose of the CF
			conventions is to require conforming datasets
			to contain sufficient metadata that they are
			self-describing in the sense that each variable
			in the file has an associated description of
			what it represents, including physical units if
			appropriate, and that each value can be located
			in space (relative to earth-based coordinates)
			and time.
		</p><p>
			An important benefit of a convention is that it
			enables software tools to display data and perform
			operations on specified subsets of the data
			with minimal user intervention. It is possible
			to provide the metadata describing how a field
			is located in time and space in many different
			ways that a human would immediately recognize as
			equivalent. The purpose in restricting how the
			metadata is represented is to make it practical
			to write software that allows a machine to parse
			that metadata and to automatically associate each
			data value with its location in time and space. It
			is equally important that the metadata be easy
			for human users to write and to understand.
		</p><p>
			This standard is intended for use with climate
			and forecast data, for atmosphere, surface and
			ocean, and was designed with model-generated data
			particularly in mind. We recognise that there are
			limits to what a standard can practically cover;
			we restrict ourselves to issues that we believe to
			be of common and frequent concern in the design of
			climate and forecast metadata. Our main purpose
			therefore, is to propose a clear, adequate and
			flexible definition of the metadata needed for
			climate and forecast data. Although this is
			specifically a netCDF standard, we feel that
			most of the ideas are of wider application. The
			metadata objects could be contained in file
			formats other than netCDF. Conversion of the
			metadata between files of different formats will
			be facilitated if conventions for all formats
			are based on similar ideas.
		</p><p>
			This convention is designed to be backward
			compatible with the COARDS conventions [<a href="bi01.html#coards" class="biblioref" title="[COARDS]"><abbr class="abbrev">COARDS</abbr></a>],
			by which we mean that a conforming COARDS dataset
			also conforms to the CF standard. Thus new
			applications that implement the CF conventions
			will be able to process COARDS datasets.
		</p><p>
			We have also striven to maximize conformance
			to the COARDS standard, that is, wherever the
			COARDS metadata conventions provide an adequate
			description we require their use. Extensions to
			COARDS are implemented in a manner such that the
			content that doesn't depend on the extensions
			is still accessible to applications that adhere
			to the COARDS standard.
