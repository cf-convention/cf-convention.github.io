			To describe the characteristic of a field that
			is represented by cell values we define the
			<code class="varname">cell_methods</code>
			attribute of the variable. This
			is a string attribute comprising a list
			of blank-separated words of the form "<code class="varname">name:
			method</code>". Each "<code class="varname">name: method</code>" pair indicates that
			for the axis identified by <code class="varname">name</code>, the cell values
			representing the field have been determined or
			derived by the specified <code class="varname">method</code>. The token name
			can be a dimension of the variable, a scalar
			coordinate variable, or a valid standard name. The
			values of <code class="varname">method</code> should be selected from the list
			in 
			<a class="xref" href="ape.html" title="Appendix E. Cell Methods">Appendix E, <i>Cell Methods</i></a>, 
			which includes 
			<code class="constant">point</code>, 
			<code class="constant">sum</code>, 
			<code class="constant">mean</code>, 
			<code class="constant">maximum</code>, 
			<code class="constant">minimum</code>, 
			<code class="constant">mid_range</code>, 
			<code class="constant">standard_deviation</code>, 
			<code class="constant">variance</code>, 
			<code class="constant">mode</code>, 
			and
			<code class="constant">median</code>. 
			Case is not
			significant in the method name. Some methods
			(e.g., <code class="constant">variance</code>) 
			imply a change of units of
			the variable, and this also is specified by
			<a class="xref" href="apd.html" title="Appendix D. Dimensionless Vertical Coordinates">Appendix D, <i>Dimensionless Vertical Coordinates</i></a>. 
			It must be remembered that the
			method applies only to the axis indicated, and
			different methods may apply to other axes. If
			a precipitation value in a longitude-latitude
			cell is given the method maximum for these axes,
			for instance, it means that it is the maximum
			within these spatial cells, and does not imply
			that it is also the maximum in time.
		</p><p>
			The default interpretation for variables that
			have cells associated with their grid points,
			but do not have the 
			<code class="varname">cell_methods</code>
			attribute
			specified, depends on whether the quantity is
			extensive (which depends on the size of the cell)
			or intensive (which doesn't). So, for example,
			suppose the quantities "accumulated precipitation"
			and "precipitation rate" each have a time axis
			and that time intervals are associated with each
			point on the time axis via a boundary variable. A
			variable representing accumulated precipitation
			is extensive in time and requires a time interval
			to be completely specified. Hence its default
			interpretation should be that the cell associated
			with the grid point represents the time interval
			over which the precipitation was accumulated. This
			is indicated explicitly by setting the cell method
			to <code class="varname">sum</code>. A precipitation rate on the other hand is
			intensive in time and could equally well represent
			an instantaneous value or a mean value over the
			time interval specified by the cell. However,
			if the <code class="varname">mean</code> method is not specified then the
			default interpretation for the quantity would be
			instantaneous. The default method is indicated
			explicity by setting the cell method to <code class="varname">point</code>.

					 Consider 12-hourly timeseries of pressure, temperature and

            If more than one cell method is to be indicated, they should be
            arranged in the order they were applied. The left-most operation
            is assumed to have been applied first. Suppose a quantity varies
            in both longitude and time (dimensions lon and time) within each
            gridbox. Values that represent the time-average of the zonal
            maximum are labelled <code class="varname">cell_methods="lon: maximum time: mean"</code>,
            i.e. find the largest value at each instant of time over all
            longitudes, then average these maxima over time; values of the
            zonal maximum of time-averages are labelled
            <code class="varname">cell_methods="time: mean lon: maximum"</code>. If the methods could
            have been applied in any order without affecting the outcome,
            they may be put in any order in the <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> attribute.
        </p><p>
            If a data value is representative of variation over a combination
            of axes, a single method should be prefixed by the names of all
            the dimensions involved, whose order is immaterial. Dimensions
            should be grouped in this way only if there is an essential
            difference from treating them individually. For instance, the
            standard deviation of topographic height within a
            longitude-latitude gridbox would have
            <code class="varname">cell_methods="lat: lon: standard_deviation"</code>. This is not the
            same as
            <code class="varname">cell_methods="lon: standard_deviation lat: standard_deviation"</code>,
            which would mean finding the standard deviation along each
            parallel of latitude within the zonal extent of the gridbox,
            and then the standard deviation of these values over latitude.
        </p><p>
            To indicate more precisely how the cell method was applied,
            extra information may be included in parentheses () after the
            identification of the method. This information includes
            standardized and non-standarized parts. Currently the only
            stardardized information is to provide the typical interval
            between the original data values to which the method was applied,
            in the situation where the present data values are statistically
            representative of original data values which had a finer spacing.
            The syntax is <code class="varname">(interval: <span class="emphasis"><em>value unit</em></span>)</code>,
            where <code class="varname"><span class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span></code> is a numerical
            value and <code class="varname"><span class="emphasis"><em>unit</em></span></code>
            is a string that can be recognized by UNIDATA's
            Udunits package [<a href="bi01.html#udunits" class="biblioref" title="[UDUNITS]"><abbr class="abbrev">UDUNITS</abbr></a>].
            The <code class="varname"><span class="emphasis"><em>unit</em></span></code> does not have to be
            dimensionally equivalent to the unit of the corresponding
            dimension name, although it often will be. Recording the original
            interval is particularly important for standard deviations.
            For example, the standard deviation of daily values could be
            indicated by
            <code class="varname">cell_methods="time: standard_deviation (interval: 1 day)"</code>
            and of annual values
            <code class="varname">cell_methods="time: standard_deviation (interval: 1 year)"</code>.
        </p><p>
            If the cell method applies to a combination of axes, they may
            have a common original interval
            e.g. <code class="varname">cell_methods="lat: lon: standard_deviation (interval: 10 km)"</code>.
            Alternatively, they may have separate intervals, which are
            matched to the names of axes by position
            e.g. <code class="varname">cell_methods="lat: lon: standard_deviation (interval: 0.1 degree_N interval: 0.2 degree_E)"</code>,
            in which 0.1 degree applies to latitude and 0.2 degree to longitude.
        </p><p>
            If there is both standardized and non-standardized information,
            the non-standardized follows the standardized information and
            the keyword <code class="varname">comment:</code>. For instance, an area-weighted mean over
            latitude could be indicated as <code class="varname">lat: mean (area-weighted)</code>
            or <code class="varname">lat: mean (interval: 1 degree_north comment: area-weighted)</code>.
        </p><p>
            A dimension of size one may be the result of "collapsing" an
            axis by some statistical operation, for instance by calculating
            a variance from time series data. We strongly recommend that
            dimensions of size one be retained and used to document the
            method and its domain.

            The convention of specifying a cell method for a
            <code class="varname">standard_name</code> rather than for
            a dimension with a coordinate variable is to allow
            one to provide an indication that a particular cell
            method is relevant to the data without having to
            provide a precise description of the corresponding cell.
            There are two reasons for doing this.

                    to the complete range of longitude and latitude
                    respectively. If in addition the data variable has
                    a dimension with a corresponding labeled axis that
                    specifies a geographic region <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#geographic-regions" title="6.1.1. Geographic Regions">Section 6.1.1, &#8220;Geographic Regions&#8221;</a>, the implied

            We recommend that whenever possible cell bounds should be
