    cell values, we define the <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> attribute of
    the variable. This is a string attribute comprising a list of
    blank-separated words of the form "<span class="emphasis"><em>name: method</em></span>".
    Each "<span class="emphasis"><em>name: method</em></span>" pair indicates that for an axis
    identified by <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>, the cell values representing the
    field have been determined or derived by the specified
    <span class="emphasis"><em>method</em></span>. For example, if data values have been
    generated by computing time means, then this could be indicated with
    <code class="varname">cell_methods="t: mean"</code>, assuming here that the name of
    the time dimension variable is "t". <span class="deletedtext">The token
    name can be a dimension of the variable, a scalar coordinate variable, or
    a valid standard name.</span></p><p><span class="newtext">In the specification of this attribute,
    <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> can be a dimension of the variable, a scalar
    coordinate variable, a valid standard name, or the word
    "<code class="varname">area</code>". (See <a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html#cell-methods-no-coordinates" title="7.3.4. Cell methods when there are no coordinates">Section 7.3.4, &#8220;<span class="newtext">Cell methods when there are no
      coordinates</span>&#8221;</a> concerning the use of standard
    names in cell_methods.)</span> The values of
    <span class="emphasis"><em>method</em></span> should be selected from the list in <a class="xref" href="ape.html" title="Appendix E. Cell Methods">Appendix E, <i>Cell Methods</i></a>, which includes
    <code class="constant">point</code>, <code class="constant">sum</code>,
    <code class="constant">mean</code>, <code class="constant">maximum</code>,
    <code class="constant">minimum</code>, <code class="constant">mid_range</code>,
    <code class="constant">standard_deviation</code>, <code class="constant">variance</code>,
    <code class="constant">mode</code>, and <code class="constant">median</code>. Case is not
    significant in the method name. Some methods (e.g.,
    <code class="constant">variance</code>) imply a change of units of the variable, as
    is indicated in <a class="xref" href="ape.html" title="Appendix E. Cell Methods">Appendix E, <i>Cell Methods</i></a>.</p><p>It must be remembered that the method applies only to the axis
    designated in <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> by
    <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>, and different methods may apply to other axes.
    If, for instance, a precipitation value in a longitude-latitude cell is
    given the method <code class="varname">maximum</code> for these axes, it means that
    it is the maximum within these spatial cells, and does not imply that it
    is also the maximum in time. Furthermore, it should be noted that if any
    <span class="emphasis"><em>method</em></span> other than "<code class="varname">point</code>" is
    specified for a given axis, then <span class="deletedtext"><code class="varname">cell_bounds</code></span> <span class="newtext"><code class="varname">bounds</code></span> should also be
    provided for that axis (except for the relatively rare exceptions
    described in <a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html#cell-methods-no-coordinates" title="7.3.4. Cell methods when there are no coordinates">Section 7.3.4, &#8220;<span class="newtext">Cell methods when there are no
      coordinates</span>&#8221;</a>).</p><p>The default interpretation for variables that do not have the
    <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> attribute specified depends on whether the
    quantity is extensive (which depends on the size of the cell) or intensive
    (which does not). Suppose, for example, the quantities "accumulated
    precipitation" and "precipitation rate" each have a time axis. A variable
    representing accumulated precipitation is extensive in time because it
    depends on the length of the time interval over which it is accumulated.
    For correct interpretation, it therefore requires a time interval to be
    completely specified via a boundary variable (i.e., via a <span class="deletedtext"><code class="varname">cell_bounds</code></span> <span class="newtext"><code class="varname">bounds</code></span> attribute for the time
    axis). In this case the default interpretation is that the cell method is
    a sum over the specified time interval. This can be (optionally) indicated
    explicitly by setting the cell method to <code class="varname">sum</code>. A
    precipitation rate on the other hand is intensive in time and could
    equally well represent either an instantaneous value or a mean value over
    the time interval specified by the cell. In this case the default
    interpretation for the quantity would be "instantaneous" (which,
    optionally, can be indicated explicitly by setting the cell method to
    <code class="varname">point</code>). More often, however, cell values for intensive
    quantities are means, and this should be indicated explicitly by setting
    the cell method to <code class="varname">mean</code> and specifying the cell
    bounds.</p><p><span class="newtext">Because the default interpretation for an
    intensive quantity differs from that of an extensive quantity and because
    this distinction may not be understood by some users of the data, it is
    recommended that every data variable include for each of its dimensions
    and each of its scalar coordinate variables the
    <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> information of interest (unless this
    information would not be meaningful). It is especially recommended that
    <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> be explicitly specified for each
    spatio-temporal dimension and each spatio-temporal scalar coordinate
    variable.</span></p><div class="example"><a name="idp7135232"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 7.4. Methods applied to a timeseries</b></p><div class="example-contents"><p>Consider 12-hourly timeseries of pressure, temperature and
        precipitation from a number of stations, where pressure is measured

        recorded, and precipitation is accumulated in a rain gauge. For a
        period of 48 hours from 6 a.m. on 19 April 1998, the data is
        structured as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">

					</pre><p>Note that in this example the time axis values coincide with the
        end of each interval. It is sometimes desirable, however, to use the
        midpoint of intervals as coordinate values for variables that are
        representative of an interval. An application may simply obtain the
        midpoint values by making use of the boundary data in
        <code class="constant">time_bnds</code>.</p></div></div><p><br class="example-break"></p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="statistics-more-than-one-axis"></a>7.3.1. <span class="newtext">Statistics for more than one

      arranged in the order they were applied. The left-most operation is
      assumed to have been applied first. Suppose, for example, that within
      each grid cell a quantity varies in both longitude and time and that
      these dimensions are named "lon" and "time", respectively. Then values
      representing the time-average of the zonal maximum are labeled
      <code class="varname">cell_methods="lon: maximum time: mean"</code> (i.e. find the
      largest value at each instant of time over all longitudes, then average
      these maxima over time); values of the zonal maximum of time-averages
      are labeled <code class="varname">cell_methods="time: mean lon: maximum"</code>.
      If the methods could have been applied in any order without affecting
      the outcome, they may be put in any order in the
      <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> attribute.</p><p>If a data value is representative of variation over a combination
      of axes, a single method should be prefixed by the names of all the
      dimensions involved (listed in any order, since in this case the order
      must be immaterial). Dimensions should be grouped in this way only if
      there is an essential difference from treating the dimensions
      individually. For instance, the standard deviation of topographic height
      within a longitude-latitude gridbox <span class="newtext">could</span> <span class="deletedtext">would</span> have <code class="varname">cell_methods="lat:
      lon: standard_deviation"</code>. (Note also, that in accordance with
      the recommendation of the following paragraph, this could be
      equivalently and preferably indicated by <code class="varname">cell_methods="area:
      standard_deviation"</code>.) This is not the same as
      <code class="varname">cell_methods="lon: standard_deviation lat:
      standard_deviation"</code>, which would mean finding the standard
      deviation along each parallel of latitude within the zonal extent of the
      gridbox, and then the standard deviation of these values over
      latitude.</p><p><span class="newtext">To indicate variation over horizontal
      area, it is recommended that instead of specifying the combination of
      horizontal dimensions, the special string "<code class="varname">area</code>" be
      used. The common case of an area-mean can thus be indicated by
      <code class="varname">cell_methods="area: mean"</code> (rather than, for example,
      "<code class="varname">lon: lat: mean</code>"). The horizontal coordinate
      variables to which "<code class="varname">area</code>" refers are in this case not
      explicitly indicated in <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> but can be
      identified, if necessary, from attributes attached to the coordinate
      variables, scalar coordinate variables, or auxiliary coordinate
      variables, as described in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4.  Coordinate Types">Chapter 4, <i>

      data and other information</span></h3></div></div></div><p>To indicate more precisely how the cell method was applied, extra
      information may be included in parentheses () after the identification
      of the method. This information includes standardized and
      non-standardized parts. Currently the only standardized information is
      to provide the typical interval between the original data values to
      which the method was applied, in the situation where the present data
      values are statistically representative of original data values which
      had a finer spacing. The syntax is (<code class="varname">interval</code>:
      <span class="emphasis"><em>value unit</em></span>), where <span class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> is a
      numerical value and <span class="emphasis"><em>unit</em></span> is a string that can be
      recognized by UNIDATA's Udunits package [<a href="bi01.html#udunits" class="biblioref" title="[UDUNITS]"><abbr class="abbrev">UDUNITS</abbr></a>].
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>unit</em></span> will usually be dimensionally equivalent
      to the unit of the corresponding dimension, but this is not required
      (which allows, for example, the interval for a standard deviation
      calculated from points evenly spaced in distance along a parallel to be
      reported in units of length even if the zonal coordinate of the cells is
      given in degrees). Recording the original interval is particularly
      important for standard deviations. For example, the standard deviation
      of daily values could be indicated by <code class="varname">cell_methods="time:
      standard_deviation (interval: 1 day)"</code> and of annual values by
      <code class="varname">cell_methods="time: standard_deviation (interval: 1
      year)"</code>.</p><p>If the cell method applies to a combination of axes, they may have
      a common original interval e.g. <code class="varname">cell_methods="lat: lon:
      standard_deviation (interval: 10 km)"</code>. Alternatively, they may
      have separate intervals, which are matched to the names of axes by
      position e.g. <code class="varname">cell_methods="lat: lon: standard_deviation
      (interval: 0.1 degree_N interval: 0.2 degree_E)"</code>, in which 0.1
      degree applies to latitude and 0.2 degree to longitude.</p><p>If there is both standardized and non-standardized information,
      the non-standardized follows the standardized information and the
      keyword <code class="varname">comment:</code>. If there is no standardized
      information, the keyword <code class="varname">comment:</code> should be omitted.
      For instance, an area-weighted mean over latitude could be indicated as
      <code class="varname">lat: mean (area-weighted)</code> or <code class="varname">lat: mean
      (interval: 1 degree_north comment: area-weighted)</code>.</p><p>A dimension of size one may be the result of "collapsing" an axis
      by some statistical operation, for instance by calculating a variance
      from time series data. We strongly recommend that dimensions of size one
      be retained (or scalar coordinate variables be defined) to enable
      documentation of the method (through the <code class="varname">cell_methods</code>

        <p>By default, the statistical method indicated by
        <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> is assumed to have been evaluated over
        the entire horizontal area of the cell. Sometimes, however, it is
        useful to limit consideration to only a portion of a cell (e.g. a mean
        over the sea-ice area). To indicate this, one of two conventions may
        be used.</p>

        <p>The first convention is a method that can be used for the common
        case of a single area-type. In this case, the
        <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> attribute may include a string of the
        form "<span class="emphasis"><em>name: method</em></span> <code class="varname">where</code>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span>". Here <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> could, for
        example, be <code class="varname">area</code> and <span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span> may
        be any of the strings permitted for a variable with a
        <code class="varname">standard_name</code> of <code class="varname">area_type</code>. As
        an example, if the method were <code class="varname">mean</code> and the
        <code class="varname">area_type</code> were <code class="varname">sea_ice</code>, then the
        data would represent a mean over only the sea ice portion of the grid
        cell. If the data writer expects <span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span> to be
        interpreted as one of the standard <code class="varname">area_type</code>
        strings, then none of the variables in the netCDF file should be given
        a name identical to that of the string (because the second convention,
        described in the next paragraph, takes precedence).</p>

        <p>The second convention is the more general. In this case, the
        <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> entry is of the form "<span class="emphasis"><em>name:
        method</em></span> <code class="varname">where</code>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>typevar</em></span>". Here <span class="emphasis"><em>typevar</em></span> is a
        string-valued auxiliary coordinate variable or string-valued scalar
        coordinate variable (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#labels" title="6.1. Labels">Section 6.1, &#8220;Labels&#8221;</a>) with a
        <code class="varname">standard_name</code> of <code class="varname">area_type</code>. The
        variable <span class="emphasis"><em>typevar</em></span> contains the name(s) of the
        selected portion(s) of the grid cell to which the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>method</em></span> is applied. This convention can
        accommodate cases in which a method is applied to more than one area
        type and the result is stored in a single data variable (with a
        dimension which ranges across the various area types). It provides a
        convenient way to store output from land surface models, for example,
        since they deal with many area types within each surface gridbox
        (e.g., <code class="varname">vegetation</code>, <code class="varname">bare_ground</code>,
        <code class="varname">snow</code>, etc.).</p>

      corresponding cell, the "<span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>" that appears in a
      "<span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>: <span class="emphasis"><em>method</em></span>" pair may be an
      appropriate <code class="varname">standard_name</code> (which identifies the
      dimension) <span class="newtext">or the string,
      "<span class="emphasis"><em>area</em></span>"</span> (rather than the name of a scalar
      coordinate variable or a dimension with a coordinate variable). This
      convention cannot be used, however, if the name of a dimension or scalar
      coordinate variable is identical to <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>. There are
      two situations where this convention is useful.</p><p>First, it allows one to provide some indication of the method when
      the cell coordinate range cannot be precisely defined. For example, a
      climatological mean might be based on any data that exists, and, in
      general, the data might not be available over the same time periods
      everywhere. In this case, the time range would not be well defined
      (because it would vary, depending on location), and it could not be
      precisely specified through a time dimension's bounds. Nevertheless,
      useful information can be conveyed by a <code class="varname">cell_methods</code>
      entry of "<code class="varname">time: mean</code>" (where <code class="varname">time</code>,
      it should be noted, is a valid <code class="varname">standard_name</code>). (As
      required by this convention, it is assumed here that for the data
      referred to by this <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> attribute, "time" is
      not a dimension or coordinate variable.)</p><p>Second, for a few special dimensions, this convention allows one
      to indicate (without explicitly defining the coordinates) that the
      method applies to the domain covering the entire permitted range of
      those dimensions. This is allowed only for longitude, latitude,
      <span class="newtext">and area (indicating a combination of
      horizontal coordinates)</span>. For longitude, the domain is
      indicated according to this provision by the string "longitude" (rather
      than the name of a longitude coordinate variable), and this implies that
      the method applies to all possible longitudes (i.e., from 0E to 360E).
      For latitude, the string "latitude" is used and implies the method
      applies to all possible latitudes (i.e., from 90S to 90N). <span class="newtext">For area, the string "area" is used and implies the
      method applies to the whole world.</span></p><p>In the second case if, in addition, the data variable has a
      dimension with a corresponding labeled axis that specifies a geographic
      region (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#geographic-regions" title="6.1.1. Geographic Regions">Section 6.1.1, &#8220;Geographic Regions&#8221;</a>), the implied range of
      longitude and latitude is the valid range for each specified region,
      <span class="newtext">or in the case of <code class="varname">area</code> the
      domain is the geographic region</span>. For example, there could be
      a <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> entry of "<code class="varname">longitude:
      mean</code>", where <code class="varname">longitude</code> is
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the name of a dimension or coordinate variable
      (but is one of the special cases given above). That would indicate a
      mean over all longitudes. Note, however, that if in addition the data
      variable had a scalar coordinate variable with a
      <code class="varname">standard_name</code> of <code class="varname">region</code> and a
      value of <code class="varname">atlantic_ocean</code>, it would indicate a mean
      over longitudes that lie within the Atlantic Ocean, not all
      longitudes.</p><p>We recommend that whenever possible, cell bounds should be
      supplied by giving the variable a dimension of size one and attaching
      bounds to the associated coordinate variable.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch07s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch07.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch07s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">7.2. Cell Measures </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 7.4. Climatological Statistics</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
