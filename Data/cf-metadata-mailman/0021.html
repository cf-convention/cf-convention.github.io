Dear CF-metadata list members,
<br />
<br />Recently I have been looking into the usage of netCDF for storing model
<br />
output. Although we have agreed that netCDF4 will be the most appropriate
<br />
file format around for output of civil engineering/environmental models,
<br />
there still remain a lot of issues to resolve for storing output data of an
<br />
integrated 1D,2D,3D modelling system using staggered (possibly multiple
<br />
interconnected, structured or unstructured) grids/meshes. So, I'm very
<br />
interested in the developments regarding CF2 conventions that seem to
<br />
address most of these issues. For the time being we focus on netCDF3.6 and
<br />
CF1.0 conventions as far as they allow us to standardise.
<br />
<br />However, when it comes to the use of standard names, I'm still not certain
<br />
what to do. Although I do understand that some kind of standardisation can
<br />
be helpful for users to understand model output from various sources and as
<br />
such it may be a valuable source of information when setting up a coupling
<br />
between model components of different origin, I feel a bit uneasy about
<br />
introducing the standard name &quot;sea_surface_height_above_sea_level&quot; in the
<br />
output of modelling systems that have so far been using &quot;water level&quot; or
<br />
similarly simple looking phrasings. So far, I have come up with two reasons
<br />
against it.
<br />
<br />The first (I admit, subjective) reason is that as a river engineer I don't
<br />
think of the water level in a river at some distance from the coast as the
<br />
&quot;sea_surface_height_above_sea_level&quot;; let alone when it comes to the water
<br />
level in rural channels, flood levels in urban areas, and water levels in
<br />
sewer systems. I have seen a recent discussion on the use of the name &quot;lake&quot;
<br />
as an alternative for &quot;sea&quot; for some particular applications, but the output
<br />
of one continuous integrated model from river via estuary to sea should have
<br />
one unique name as it is one data set; we cannot differentiate between
<br />
river_surface_height and sea_surface_height. Neither should it be model run
<br />
dependent (no different name for model output depending on modelled area or
<br />
user). I expect that this subjective reason may also work the other way: you
<br />
may not want to introduce such &quot;pollution&quot; in the usage of the existing
<br />
names (but I am not sure about that).
<br />
<br />The second reason is that the reference level is not everywhere the same: a
<br />
river in Tibet may be modelled using a completely different reference level
<br />
than a lowland river like the Rhine or the Mississippi. This issues is still
<br />
relevant for coastal areas as different countries tend to use different
<br />
reference levels as mean sea level, there is still a few centimetres
<br />
difference between the Dutch NAP and the German NN. Similar differences
<br />
occur in the horizontal direction when it comes to coordinate systems and
<br />
conversions.
<br />
<br />One may thus suggest to introduce a quantity like
<br />
&quot;water_surface_height_above_reference_level&quot; and require some specification
<br />
of the reference level. However, the question can be extended to other
<br />
related quantities like sea_water_x_velocity and other similar quantities.
<br />
So, in the end my questions are:
<br />
<br />(1) what are the main reasons for using standard names
<br />
(2) does it make sense to use such naming conventions for an integrated
<br />
1D,2D,3D modelling system that is used from urban areas to coastal seas and
<br />
beyond (coupled to hydrological, groundwater and/or meteorological models).
<br />
(3) or, wouldn't it be better to define a name space and some mapping as has
<br />
been suggested in relation to CF2 standards
<br />
<br />I would be very interested in your ideas in this matter either via a reply
<br />
to this list or via a direct reply to me if you prefer.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
