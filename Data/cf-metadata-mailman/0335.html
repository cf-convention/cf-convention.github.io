Hi,
<br />
<br />The EU-funded ENSEMBLES project is generating a large set of 
<br />
seasonal-to-decadal (s2d) multi-forecast system ensemble hindcasts. 
<br />
Multi-forecast systems include multi-models and perturbed-parameter 
<br />
ensembles. The ENSEMBLES s2d hindcasts mimic the European multi-model 
<br />
seasonal ensemble operational forecasts. The data are written in GRIB, 
<br />
but we intend to improve their dissemination by making the data also 
<br />
available in NetCDF format.
<br />
<br />We found that the current standard names do not allow to describe the 
<br />
structure of multi-forecast system ensemble forecasts using the CF 
<br />
convention. Therefore, we would like to propose some additional CF 
<br />
standard names to avoid ambiguities when coding multi-forecast system 
<br />
ensemble data:
<br />
<br />1) experiment_identifier (STRING). The producing centre is responsible 
<br />
for assigning unique experiment identifiers for the different 
<br />
experiments created, and should (ideally) provide documentation of each 
<br />
experiment. It is possible for common experiment identifiers to be 
<br />
agreed between different centres, if they are carrying out a common 
<br />
experiment or creating a multi-model forecast system. There is no a 
<br />
priori guarantee that identical identifiers from different centres could 
<br />
refer to scientifically equivalent experiments.
<br />
2) originating_centre (STRING). Institution with scientific 
<br />
responsibility for the forecast system.
<br />
3) forecast_system_version_number (INTEGER, units=1). This number should 
<br />
be used to distinguish between different prediction systems used by the 
<br />
same institution. For instance, the Met Office will have to choose a 
<br />
system number for the GloSea model and a different one for the DePreSys 
<br />
system (both based on the HadCM3 coupled model). It is assigned by the 
<br />
producing centre and gives scientific details of the models used. A 
<br />
table online should provide the corresponding information.
<br />
4) forecast_method_number (INTEGER, units=1). This variable 
<br />
distinguishes forecasts made with the same underlying forecasting 
<br />
system, but where variations have been introduced such that the 
<br />
different integrations have different properties, most importantly 
<br />
different climate drift. An example is given by the several members of a 
<br />
perturbed parameter ensemble forecast, which should share the 
<br />
&quot;forecast_system_version_number&quot; but have different values of the 
<br />
&quot;forecast_method_number&quot;. As for &quot;forecast_system_version_number&quot;, a 
<br />
table online should provide the corresponding information.
<br />
5) ensemble_member_number (INTEGER, units=1). Different integrations 
<br />
made with the same origin, experiment identifier, method and system 
<br />
number created using initial-condition perturbations, which form a 
<br />
homogenous and a priori statistically indistinguishable ensemble.
<br />
<br />A single multi-forecast system experiment includes data from multiple 
<br />
forecast systems, either from a single centre or from several. The 
<br />
variables 1-4 make a natural tuplet to define a particular homogenous 
<br />
multi-forecast system ensemble forecast. The ensemble is then spanned by 
<br />
the ensemble_member_number variable. For instance, a multi-model 
<br />
ensemble forecast or a perturbed-parameter ensemble is made of a 
<br />
collection of such tuplets.
<br />
<br />Although not actually needed for distribution and archive purposes, 
<br />
additional variables with the same dimension as the variable 
<br />
experiment_identifier are also suggested:
<br />
<br />1) original_distributor (STRING). Centre with responsibility for 
<br />
distribution of data, ie the centre who first made the data publicly 
<br />
available, and to whom queries of data integrity should be sent.
<br />
2) production_status (STRING). Operational, research or a user defined 
<br />
project identifier. The value &quot;research&quot; should be used for general 
<br />
research at a specific centre, while project_id should be used for 
<br />
specified international research projects.
<br />
3) sst_specification (STRING). It describes the use of the SSTs in the 
<br />
specific experiment and can take values such as &quot;coupled&quot;, &quot;observed&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;predicted&quot;, &quot;persisted anomaly&quot; or &quot;persisted absolute&quot;.
<br />
4) real_time (CHARACTER). It takes the values &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, 
<br />
according to whether the forecast was or not made in real-time. It is an 
<br />
attribute of the individual forecasts.
<br />
5) archive_date (INTEGER, units=days from specific date). Describes when 
<br />
the data was archived or published. The aim is to provide an approximate 
<br />
timestamp, to easily distinguish between recent experiments and much 
<br />
older ones. Also, in the case that data need to be corrected in a 
<br />
globally distributed data system, the archive_date could be used to 
<br />
distinguish between the older, original data and the newer, corrected 
<br />
data. This is an attribute of the individual forecast.
<br />
<br />Some relevant issues for the encoding of multi-forecast system ensembles 
<br />
data are as follows:
<br />
<br />- We use the variables &quot;forecast_period&quot; and &quot;forecast_reference_time&quot; 
<br />
as independent time variables employed to define the two time axes of a 
<br />
forecast dataset with several start dates, ie, both &quot;forecast_period&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;forecast_reference_time&quot; are multivalued. We believe that 
<br />
&quot;forecast_period&quot; cannot have time units referenced to a specific date 
<br />
as &quot;forecast_reference_time&quot; does. This is to prevent having in the file 
<br />
forecasts with the same verifying date but produced from a different 
<br />
start date (and, hence, intrinsically different). An alternative would 
<br />
consist in introducing an index dimension and make two one-dimensional 
<br />
auxiliary time coordinate variables with this dimension, as suggested by 
<br />
Jonathan Gregory in the thread &quot;file with both run time and forecast 
<br />
(valid) time coordinates&quot;. Any thoughts about this?
<br />
<br />- It has to be mentioned that although &quot;realization&quot; is an existing 
<br />
standard name to handle ensembles, it can be used to identify either a 
<br />
forecast_system_version_number (a member of a multi-model ensemble from 
<br />
the same institution), a forecast_method_number (a member of a 
<br />
perturbed-parameter ensemble) or an ensemble_member_number (a member of 
<br />
an initial-condition ensemble). This is problematic as a multi-forecast 
<br />
system ensemble dataset might have to use those three variables 
<br />
dimensioned independently. Therefore, the use of these three variables 
<br />
is suggested instead to distinguish the elements of an experiment 
<br />
carried out with a multi-forecast system.
<br />
<br />The proposed names take account of established practice at operational 
<br />
centres and usual practice in the research community of climate 
<br />
variability at different time scales. These names are part of a more 
<br />
general proposal to unambiguously define the appropriate metadata for 
<br />
multi-forecast system ensembles, which is based upon a more general 
<br />
proposal under discussion by WCRP. The proposal is available from:
<br />
<a href="http://www.ecmwf.int/research/EU_projects/ENSEMBLES/data/index.html">http://www.ecmwf.int/research/EU_projects/ENSEMBLES/data/index.html</a>
<br />
<br />The names and data structure suggested in this message are likely to be 
<br />
relevant for other operational multi-forecast system ensemble forecast 
<br />
activities such as EUROSIP or TIGGE.
<br />
<br />Apologies for the long message.
<br />
Best regards,
<br />
Paco
