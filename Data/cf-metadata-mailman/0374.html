Hi Folks
<br />
<br />It seems that there are two threads to the massive email from
<br />
Jamie,Paco, Jonathan that we've seen (and which is not included
<br />
below :-).
<br />
<br />The first is how to expedite aggregation, which is the point John has
<br />
picked up on, and the second is how to deal with the special case of
<br />
ensemble metadata. In this email I'm going to try and boil down what I
<br />
think the issues are. 
<br />
<br />The suggestion proposed, as far as I can see reduces to:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
a) we should create some standard names which exactly correspond to
<br />
some recommended global variables, and model integrations should use
<br />
global variables where they contain exactly one realization to indicate
<br />
these.
<br />
<br />b) upon aggregation, one should use the realization dimension (called
<br />
joinDim by John and realization by the triumvirate) as both a dimension
<br />
on the aggregated variable and a key to the metadata about the
<br />
realizations which is extracted from global variables and populates some
<br />
new variables which are essentially metadata variables. (This automatic
<br />
extraction would be based on a correspondence between standard names and
<br />
global attribute names)
<br />
<br />At this point if we take the word model from point a) and the constraint
<br />
on realization, then what we have is a rule for how to construct global
<br />
metadata into aggregated netcdf files. 
<br />
<br />Note that CF doesn't *require* any global attributes (2.6.2), so no code
<br />
can rely on them being present, nor does it *limit* global attributes to
<br />
only those defined. (Which is good, because I think those defined are
<br />
not precise enough for me, nor for Paco, judging by the discussion).
<br />
<br />I would have thought it makes sense that in producing any aggregation,
<br />
that any of the original metadata which distinguishes the original files
<br />
(and their contents) should appear in metadata associated with the join
<br />
dimension. From a coding point of view the problem will arise in the
<br />
join when the individual files don't all have the appropriate global
<br />
attributes (trust me, it'll happen). Anyway from a CF point of view this
<br />
produces CF issue A: What is the best method of providing metadata on an
<br />
aggregation dimension and indicating that's what has been done?
<br />
<br />(Issue B: might be to make sure our solution works when we aggregate two
<br />
files that have already been aggregated).
<br />
<br />I'm sure John has thought more than most (especially me) about this, so
<br />
I'll shut up about aggregation for now ...
<br />
<br />At this point there is no necessity for any modifications of standard
<br />
names, the discussion thus far is simply about how to use what
<br />
attributes we have, but:
<br />
<br />Issue C: should we have a standard name modifier associated with a
<br />
variable on the aggregation dimension to show that it was produced by
<br />
aggregating file attributes?
<br />
<br />They also got into what I would call the specifics of variable metadata
<br />
needed to distinguish ensemble member identity and characteristics.
<br />
These may or may not need standard names, but let's start with the
<br />
principle. Are these not simply special cases of variable metadata? With
<br />
the possible exception of ensemble_weight, all the others are intended
<br />
to be either character strings or url links to information about
<br />
variable metadata. In principle we could want exactly the same
<br />
facilities for any variables (e.g. a bunch of station data in one file,
<br />
we might want to have a lot more characteristics of each station linked
<br />
by the station dimension in exactly the same way as the  realization
<br />
dimension could be used).
<br />
<br />So, I think what we have here is a discussion about what are the
<br />
variable attributes (metadata) required to distinguish ensemble members
<br />
(or model integrations)? This could go way beyond what we have seen in
<br />
the email. Jamie has referred to our work on NumSim
<br />
(<a href="http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/ndg/wiki/NumSim">http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/ndg/wiki/NumSim</a>), and there is also the work
<br />
on Numerical Model Metadata
<br />
(<a href="http://www.cgam.nerc.ac.uk/pmwiki/NMM/index.php/">http://www.cgam.nerc.ac.uk/pmwiki/NMM/index.php/</a>). Similarly, the
<br />
metadata one *might* want to attach to any observation goes way beyond
<br />
what one can mandate in the CF file (e.g. SensorML etc).
<br />
<br />So there is a continuum of information one could have about a variable
<br />
(indexed by station or realization or whatever), ranging from simply
<br />
identity (e.g. item number in the sequence) to it's source, to the
<br />
entire content of one these external schema.
<br />
<br />CF has a number of ways of actually adding such information, we can use
<br />
labels (6.1), Ancillary Data etc ... and so without going into the
<br />
specifics of the triumvirate discussion, the issue really is:
<br />
<br />Issue-D: how far should CF go into providing standard names for
<br />
describing variable metadata?
<br />
<br />Quite clearly there is utility in new standard names, but in doing so
<br />
are we not straying into the governance territory of others - (e.g.
<br />
SensorML). I've argued quite strongly that we shouldn't do any more of
<br />
this, because every time we do, we add to the CF maintenance problem
<br />
(e.g. I think we already have problems with gazeteers). 
<br />
<br />Now I know (because I talked to Jamie on the phone) that triumvirate
<br />
could argue that in the case of model metadata, it would be helpful for
<br />
CF to mandate this stuff at least for the numerical model community. 
<br />
<br />Now we can do that ... but ...
<br />
<br />I didn't want to make a proposal in this email, but, I think we should
<br />
have a standard mechanism of indicating that a specific characterstring
<br />
variable set comes from an external vocabulary indicated by a URI:,
<br />
something like:
<br />
<br />variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float temperature(realization,...);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature:coordinates=&quot;realization ...&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature:ancillary_variables = &quot;metadata&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;char metadata(realization,len80);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metadata:external_dictionary='<a href="http://someExternalGovernanceBody">http://someExternalGovernanceBody</a>';
<br />
(i.e. a new modifier).
<br />
<br />Then, IPCC, or WMO or whoever, could come up with the dictionaries they
<br />
want, and the cf file would still be self-describing, cf-software could
<br />
still manipulate it, but communities could write software that made use
<br />
of these extra characteristics, without CF having to govern everything
<br />
(and add all the components of these external schema to CF, piece by
<br />
piece, with detailed arguments for each one to go in the standard name
<br />
table). 
<br />
<br />Obviously my mechanism could be extended for any characteristic of a
<br />
variable that we didn't want to put in a standard name, so the real
<br />
policy issue is Issue-D, and it comes back to the scope of CF, which
<br />
needs some decision.
<br />
<br />Thus far we have held a line on standard names, but I feel the
<br />
Paco,Jamie,Jonathan proposal takes us into new territory. We will take
<br />
on having to discuss and approve a whole new class of standard names
<br />
(and all the work that goes with that). It's fine if it's a community
<br />
decision to go there, but we need our eyes open :-), and some realistic
<br />
appreciation of how we can actually do it. 
<br />
<br />My opinion: better to push it off onto the communities who care, and
<br />
keep CF focused.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
Bryan
