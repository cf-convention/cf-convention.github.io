Dear All
<br />
<br />As I was away for a week, I've just read the last two weeks of emails on this
<br />
thread and would offer the following comments:
<br />
<br />* Do we agree to define some new global attributes, which could also be
<br />
attributes of data variables in the case where aggregation is not done? I
<br />
am not sure we have finalised the requirements for these.
<br />
<br />* I agree with the several arguments that the simple solution for aggregation
<br />
of adding a realization dimension is the best for the moment. It might
<br />
be that the possibility of aggregating groups of heterogenous objects in
<br />
netCDF-4 will turn out to be useful, but we haven't currently a requirement for
<br />
that flexibility, it appears. When someone does, we can define a convention.
<br />
CF already explicitly permits going beyond 4D, and I hope software will be
<br />
adapted to deal with that, as it appears that GrADS is.
<br />
<br />* I wonder if there is sometimes a confusion between standard names and the
<br />
contents of variables. Defining a new standard name is not the same as
<br />
standardising the values that a variable can take which has this name. Most
<br />
standard names, of course, are for continuous physical variables whose contents
<br />
need no standardisation. Standardisation may be needed for variables which take
<br />
one of a discrete set of values. flag_values and flag_meanings (CF 3.5) are a
<br />
mechanism to do this which allows the file to be self-describing. Otherwise,
<br />
we have to use external tables. So far we have only done this for names of
<br />
regions, but we have some other standard names for quantities which might need
<br />
to be standardised, such as land cover. A realization dimension to provide
<br />
information on the provenance of data could fall in this category too, as
<br />
discussed.
<br />
<br />* Re Bryan's example
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; float temperature(realization,time,lat,lon):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    temperature:coordinates = 'realization time lat lon' ;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    temperature:ancillary_variables = 'metadata1 metadata2 metadata3 '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; # Note also I'm using ancillary variables not coordinate variables, it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; #   only the realization that we're using in this way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; char metadata1(realization,len100):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    metadata1:external_vocabulary = <a href="http://wmo.foo.int/identifierY">http://wmo.foo.int/identifierY</a> 
</em><br />
<br />I raised this before, but I still don't think these should be ancillary
<br />
variables.  Ancillary variables provide metadata for each value of a data
<br />
variables, such as its quality flag or uncertainty. I think the metadata
<br />
variables, which have the realization dimension, are auxiliary coordinate
<br />
variables and should be included in the coordinates attribute, not in an
<br />
ancillary_variables attribute. They are auxiliary coordinate variables of the
<br />
kind described by CF 6 on labels etc. They should each be identified by having
<br />
their standard name. So I would put
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;float temperature(realization,time,lat,lon):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature:coordinates = 'time lat lon metadata1' ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;char metadata1(realization,len100):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metadata1:standard_name=&quot;institution&quot;; // for instance
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metadata1:external_vocabulary = <a href="http://wmo.foo.int/identifierY">http://wmo.foo.int/identifierY</a> 
<br />
<br />I proposed that the new standard names would be the same as the new or
<br />
existing global and local attributes that we use for these purposes
<br />
(such as institution).
<br />
<br />* We have informally developed (but not included in the standards document) a 
<br />
convention for handling forecast/analysis time
<br />
<a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2006/001008.html">http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2006/001008.html</a>
<br />
If there is only a need for one time axis (only forecast or only analysis) it
<br />
can be a 1D time coordinate as usual. If there are two kinds of time, it is
<br />
recommended to use a 1D index axis, with auxiliary coordinate variables to
<br />
specify analysis time and forecast time or period. This latter arrangement is
<br />
flexible because it allows gaps in the 2D matrix. NetCDF-4 could support it
<br />
with ragged arrays, which I presume are internally mapped onto a single
<br />
dimension just like this. In a recent posting, Steve said he and Bryan also
<br />
felt that 2D time was not needed. That is consistent with earlier discussion.
<br />
<br />* In a sense, everything is provisional, in that we could always change it
<br />
later (as we can do with aliases for standard names). However, we are always
<br />
facing the problem that people want a convention to use straight away. Often
<br />
they immediately use it to produce lots of data, or they even produce the
<br />
data before the convention is finally agreed, since our discussions are slow.
<br />
It does not really help in practice to say that the convention is provisional.
<br />
If a mountain of useful data exists, changing the convention presents a
<br />
problem of backward compatibility. That's not to say that we can't do it, but
<br />
I conclude that what we have to do is think as carefully as possible (and as
<br />
fast as possible) so that we decide wisely, and minimise the possibility of
<br />
having to change afterwards. We should not have the approach that our decisions
<br />
are prototypes so it is not so important to get it right, because prototypes
<br />
have a habit of remaining in use, and when it is archived data that is
<br />
concerned, not just software, this is even truer. A corollary, in my view,
<br />
is that we must limit our scope to what is needed. We should certainly have an
<br />
eye out for obvious generalisation that is likely to be required soon, but we
<br />
need not try too hard to make predictions for future use.
<br />
<br />* It would be useful if GrADS could support auxiliary coordinates and bounds,
<br />
since these are generally valuable features - especially bounds, which I find
<br />
practically essential. However, I understand that effort is limited!
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
