Hi Folks
<br />
<br />I've said enough about process for now.
<br />
<br />We should get back to discussing exactly what's on the table. I've
<br />
enumerated key paragraphs to help discussion.  I will move this to trac
<br />
once Kyle reminds me what my account details are :-(
<br />
<br />1) I think there is general acceptance that we can have something like:
<br />
<br />float temperature(realization,time,lat,lon):
<br />
temperature:coordinates = 'realization time lat lon' ;
<br />
<br />2) I then muddied the waters by suggesting using ancillary variables for
<br />
metadata about the realizations. Jamie and Jonathan stressed that we
<br />
should use auxillary coordinate variables. They were right.
<br />
<br />3) Jonathan's example then was similar to the following, where I've
<br />
added an extra metadata label to stress the point that as I understand
<br />
it the auxillary coordinate variables provide a mechanism for slicing
<br />
the realizations in many ways, without adding to the dimensionality of
<br />
the ensemble itself (by the way, this could be useful for station data
<br />
as it stands provided we don't overload much meaning into
<br />
&quot;realization&quot;). This should allow a lot of the functionality paco wants.
<br />
<br />float temperature(realization,time,lat,lon):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature:coordinates = 'time lat lon metadata1 metadata2' ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;char metadata1(realization,len100):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metadata1:standard_name=&quot;institution&quot;; // for instance
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;char metadata2(realization,len100):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metadata2:standard_name=&quot;thing2; // for instance
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
4) As an aside at this point it seems we don't need a standard name for
<br />
&quot;realization&quot; even though we have one ... (although we'd need it for the
<br />
case where there were no auxillary coordinate variables).
<br />
<br />5) I suggested that where we don't already have standard names for the
<br />
metadata here, that we should not invent them.  I made the argument that
<br />
we were opening a huge metadata door here and that we ought not reinvent
<br />
the entire wheel within CF.
<br />
<br />6) I further made the argument that whatever metadata we did want
<br />
internally for these  should not be *standard names*, which in my mind
<br />
really ought to be about defining physical variables  (things with
<br />
units), or at least things which we directly might expect to manipulate
<br />
(e.g. realization weights). I think the intention for this stuff is also
<br />
different from the flag concept as well ...
<br />
<br />7) I accept that there is merit in standard &quot;somethings&quot; which map our
<br />
existing global attributes, which ought to help aggregation tools. John?
<br />
<br />8) So, I was proposing something new, which I then think should be
<br />
provisional: firstly, that we create a new class of standard
<br />
identifiers, which we call &quot;standard_metadata&quot;, and we put the global
<br />
file attribute things in here, and anything else we find external
<br />
vocabularies inadequate for.
<br />
<br />9) So the example would be rather than in 3) above, we would have:
<br />
float temperature(realization,time,lat,lon):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature:coordinates = 'time lat lon metadata1 metadata2' ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;char metadata1(realization,len100):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metadata1:standard_metadata=&quot;institution&quot;; // for instance
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;char metadata2(realization,len100):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metadata2:standard_metadata=&quot;thing2; // for instance
<br />
<br />Note that one could still have *standard_names* in as auxillary
<br />
coordinate variables, but when we use standard_metadata, we are
<br />
explicitly saying there is nothing physical about this information!
<br />
I think that would be of considerable aid to software! 
<br />
<br />10) But, secondly, where possible *for metadata* we should use external
<br />
vocabularies, and *not* add new stuff into our controlled vocabularies.
<br />
I thought the mechanism for doing this would be (for anything actually,
<br />
not just for standard_metadata):
<br />
<br />char metadata1(realization,len100):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metadata1:external_vocabulary = <a href="http://wmo.foo.int/identifierY">http://wmo.foo.int/identifierY</a> 
<br />
<br />11) Obviously if one wrote a file containing this stuff, one would 
<br />
a) be documenting the file consistently, this doesn't  necessarily rely
<br />
on external tables any more than using standard_names relies on the
<br />
external definitions.
<br />
b) want some faith that www.foo.int will keep that meaning around at
<br />
least as long as the data exists. That's no more or less a leap of faith
<br />
than in CF ... any given data producer can then make their own decision
<br />
about doing that.
<br />
<br />12) If there is an existing cf standard name or cf standard metadata for
<br />
this, then *don't* use them both - that way lies confusion (it's
<br />
unlikely that the two will really be identical). In this I differ
<br />
strongly from Jonathan's last suggestion.
<br />
<br />That's probably enough for now.
<br />
<br />Bryan
