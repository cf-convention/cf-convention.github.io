Dear all
<br />
<br />I don't think we intended axis to be used for auxiliary coord vars. It doesn't
<br />
say this explicitly in the document, but &quot;axis&quot; would be an odd name for a 2D
<br />
grid, and auxiliary coord vars are introduced in CF 5, whereas axis is in CF 4.
<br />
<br />Yes, I still think we should after all restrict X and Y to genuine 1D lon and
<br />
lat coord variables. As Simon correctly says, the axis attribute in this case
<br />
is not necessary, because you can identify lon and lat from units, which are
<br />
mandatory, and standard_name, if present. We certainly had discussions about
<br />
this redundancy when we introduced the axis attribute.
<br />
<br />The redundancy arises because we continue to support COARDS. Suppose that one
<br />
day we didn't insist on COARDS conventions. In that case it might be natural
<br />
to use units of degrees for lon and lat, as we do for rotated lon and lat. The
<br />
use of degrees_east etc. arises because COARDS depends on units to identify the
<br />
axes. We could identify lon and lat by standard name, if we made the standard
<br />
name mandatory. We did not make it mandatory because of COARDS compatibility. 
<br />
However, for the vertical, the standard name would not be sufficient because
<br />
there are many possible vertical coordinates. The COARDS convention is to
<br />
identify an axis as vertical if it has units of pressure or a positive
<br />
attribute, and CF upholds that too. But in a non-COARDS convention, I'd suggest
<br />
it would be simpler to make the axis=&quot;Z&quot; attribute mandatory. Similarly, it is
<br />
easier to identify a time axis by axis=&quot;T&quot; than by parsing it to see whether it
<br />
has units of time; standard name is not sufficient again because there is more
<br />
than one possible standard name for time. This paragraph may seem like a
<br />
digression, but the conclusion of it is that I think the axis attribute is a
<br />
good thing to have because it is what we would use to identify 1D axes if we
<br />
departed from COARDS compatibility. That's not a strong argument.
<br />
<br />There already exists data where X and Y have been used for coord vars which are
<br />
not 1D lon and lat. If we restrict the use of it now, the implication is that
<br />
new CF-compliant applications would be entitled to assume that any coord var
<br />
labelled X is actually 1D longitude, even though it might not be if it was old
<br />
data. They should therefore test the Conventions attribute before making this
<br />
assumption to check the version of CF. Existing CF-compliant applications
<br />
would not make this assumption; they should instead be using the units or
<br />
standard_name to identify lon and lat axes. There will be no problems for them
<br />
with new data written using the restricted meaning of X and Y.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
