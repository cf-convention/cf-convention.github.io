Dear Bryan, John, Paco, Brian, et al.
<br />
<br />I think we are all happy with the idea of a realization dimension and
<br />
auxiliary string coordinate variables (labels) with this dimension that
<br />
contain the various metadata.
<br />
<br />John said that he would require one of these variables to have unique values
<br />
(no repeats) so it could be used for selection. Brian pointed out that the
<br />
current CF (6) provision for label coordinates doesn't have such a restriction.
<br />
However, unique values are required for coordinate variables for the same
<br />
reason that John wants them in this case. If we could regard a realization
<br />
variable as a coordinate variable rather than as alternative label information,
<br />
the uniqueness requirement would be natural. In netCDF string-valued
<br />
arrays have to be 2D character variables, because there isn't support for
<br />
true arrays of strings, but this is a restriction of the file format, and
<br />
netCDF-4 does have strings (I believe). In netCDF-4 it would be natural, I
<br />
think, to have a 1D array of strings whose name was the same as the name of
<br />
its dimension e.g. realization(realization) i.e. a coordinate variable. We
<br />
can't do this now: it has to be realization(realization,stringlength) and we
<br />
even recommend against having a multidimensional array whose name matches the
<br />
name of a dimension, so that it is not misidentified as a coordinate variable.
<br />
But for strings it isn't &quot;logically&quot; multidimensional. So I would propose:
<br />
<br />* If a 2D auxiliary coordinate variable is of char type and its name is the
<br />
same as the name of its first dimension, it should be regarded as a string-
<br />
valued coordinate variable, and its string values should all be distinct.
<br />
Coordinate variables are also required to be monotonic. Do you want to make
<br />
this requirement too for string-valued ones? I can't see the need for it
<br />
myself, because you don't perform operations on string-valued variables or
<br />
use them for plotting positions, like you do with numeric ones.
<br />
<br />* If it has any other name, it should be regarded as a label/alternative
<br />
coordinate variable as currently in CF 6, and the restriction does not apply.
<br />
<br />In either case the nature of the metadata needs to be identified. Bryan says
<br />
he &quot;strongly disagrees&quot; with my suggestion. I'm not sure which one of them he
<br />
dislikes :-) but it might be my proposal that new standard names for these
<br />
things (such as institution) should be the same as the new or existing names
<br />
for global and data variable attributes. It seems sensible to me to make them
<br />
the same names, so probably the objectionable bit is their designation as
<br />
standard names.
<br />
<br />Bryan proposes that instead of standard names they should be some new
<br />
attribute, because standard names are for physical quantities and we should
<br />
know what is physical. John may also see an advantage in this. I can see there
<br />
is a sort of difference, but I don't really think it's clear-cut. We already
<br />
have standard names for some things that aren't really physical quantities in
<br />
Bryan's sense e.g. land_cover and region (string-valued), and various platform_
<br />
names (describing the observation platform rather than any quantity which is
<br />
observed). I suspect there are grey areas. Why should we make a functional
<br />
distinction, for instance, between the ensemble member number and the analysis
<br />
time for various forecasts made for the same verification time? I think Bryan
<br />
would put these in different categories. Moreover, the standard_name and the
<br />
new attribute will have to be searched for in the same kind of way, and the
<br />
values of the coordinates they label have to be treated in the same ways
<br />
(selection, labelling axes, etc.); it complicates the software to have to
<br />
do this with two different attributes and two different tables to look them up
<br />
in rather than one. It seems simpler to me to make them standard names. If
<br />
there is a need for a distinction, we could make it with some additional
<br />
attribute. What different treatments are needed that should be flagged?
<br />
<br />I believe we agree that it's useful to have an attribute that points to an
<br />
external dictionary. This could be useful for string-valued existing standard-
<br />
named quantities such as region. I agree that it would be good if these tables
<br />
weren't maintained by us, but I don't think we can do that (as I've said
<br />
before) without an agreement with the dictionary-maintainer about the format
<br />
and content of the dictionary. Do others think the same?
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
