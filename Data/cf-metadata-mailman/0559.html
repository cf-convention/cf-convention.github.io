<br />
Hello,
<br />
<br />sorry to have gone so quiet on this.  I'm not sure I have anything to
<br />
add to make a lot of progress, certainly few concrete suggestions...
<br />
<br />1)  Originally we added realization and realization_weight* as standard
<br />
name and a standard name modifier to help support a representation of
<br />
probability distributions (such as those generated by Monte-Carlo
<br />
methods).  The extension appears as a minor addition - which is probably
<br />
why it didn't attract too much attention when proposed - though it does
<br />
break the '4D COARDS/CF nut' by introducing the explicit recognition of
<br />
a 5th (the realization) dimension into the CF standard.
<br />
<br />The current version of the standard name table has realization units as
<br />
1 (not string as I and others have implied in examples) - though I
<br />
imagine it is not too late to change this.  I think there may be good
<br />
reason to keep this as it is.  Since the realization dimension is so
<br />
hard to label maybe we should say the simplest (default) thing to do is
<br />
leave the realization coordinate as an integer index.  I think this
<br />
helps with the uniqueness issue that John and others have talked about.
<br />
<br />Bryan raised the issue that the standard name realization is not always
<br />
needed.  That's true - though I think we need it in there as there are
<br />
cases where it is needed to help recognition of which is the realization
<br />
dimension - for instance if you want to apply the realization weights
<br />
and you can not infer the which is the realization dimension from other
<br />
information you have (this may be pretty rare - but it could happen if
<br />
you have another non spatial-temporal dimension of the same length as
<br />
realization).
<br />
<br />Maybe we should strongly recommend that if you have a variable in a file
<br />
that has a standard name modifier 'realization weight' then the
<br />
realization coordinate variable should be included in the file and have
<br />
the standard name 'realization'?  (Of course, if we stick with
<br />
realization as units '1', this may be a bit space wasteful in some cases
<br />
as the coordinate variable will just be filled with the indices
<br />
1:realization.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
2) A related (but maybe should be separated) issue is then how to label
<br />
the process's used to generate the individual realizations.  At the
<br />
moment we have two proposals - one is to identify particular realization
<br />
label coordinates by standard names, the other is to recognise them by
<br />
introducing a new cf attribute which is 'standard metadata'.   Bryan's
<br />
interpretation of standard names referring to physical quantities seems
<br />
to fit well with how standard names are introduced in section 3.3 of CF.
<br />
But as Jonathan points out its not that clear cut.
<br />
<br />One of the values of having standard names is that it tells you what
<br />
quantities you can compare.   If I have numerical physical quantities
<br />
then in order to do a comparison I need to check they are referring to
<br />
the same thing (standard_name, cell_methods) and make adjustments to
<br />
make sure I'm on the same scale (units, offset, scale factor type
<br />
things).  For string's there is an analogous process - but its
<br />
definitely a different process. For string valued 'things' I need to
<br />
make sure they are the same thing (say 'region' or 'surface_cover') and
<br />
from the same vocabulary, and if not do a translation between vocabs.
<br />
Is this difference sufficient to say that we should disallow  string
<br />
valued standard_names and allow only 'standard_metadata' to be string
<br />
valued? (OK there are backwards compatibility problems there as we
<br />
already have a couple of string valued standard_names).  This is maybe
<br />
what Bryan has been driving at for a while?
<br />
<br />(I'm not really sure what cell_methods mean for string valued
<br />
standard_names either)
<br />
<br />Jamie
