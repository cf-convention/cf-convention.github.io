<br />
Hello Jamie, Paco, Jonathan and Roy,
<br />
<br />Thank you all for your recent comments.  Firstly I would like to make a
<br />
general point about the purpose of the standard name status reports.  They
<br />
are intended to achieve two things: (1) to keep everyone up to date with the
<br />
state of play on the various standard names threads without having to
<br />
follow every discussion in detail; (2) to identify the unresolved issues
<br />
and prompt further discussion.  Writing the summaries helps me to keep things
<br />
straight in my own mind and I hope they are useful to others, if only to
<br />
reassure people that their proposals have not been forgotten, especially when
<br />
progress is slow.  Preparing the summaries is, of course, a subjective process
<br />
and sometimes I will get things wrong - I am always happy for people to point
<br />
out when I have made a mistake or misrepresented something.
<br />
<br />My summary of the ensembles discussion concluded with:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given the direction that the discussion has taken since the initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposals were made on 15th October 2006 I will now close &quot;ensembles&quot; as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard names issue.  The names will _not_ be added to the table.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, ensembles will most definitely remain open as a CF1.0 conventions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue.
</em><br />
This seems to be causing some concern.  Before writing this I reread the whole
<br />
of the ensembles discussion and I believed this to be the point that had been
<br />
reached in the conversation.  Since Bryan's posting of 27th October there has
<br />
been no further discussion of the specific standard name proposals.  Rather,
<br />
the question has been whether or not standard names is the correct mechanism
<br />
for labelling metadata.
<br />
<br />My overall impression was that people felt that being able to specify an
<br />
external vocabulary or standard metadata would be a useful addition to the CF
<br />
standard. There seemed to be general agreement that it could
<br />
accommodate ensemble metadata and also other types of metadata that may be
<br />
needed in the future.  Rereading again today I realise that there are a couple
<br />
of points raised by Jonathan that should have been included in my summary but
<br />
weren't.  They are:
<br />
(1) if we adopt Bryan's proposal then we need a way of deciding whether new
<br />
metadata added within CF should be standard names or standard metadata;
<br />
(2) when using external vocabularies we would need to be sure of the format and
<br />
content - these may need to be agreed with the vocabulary owner.
<br />
Regarding (1), Bryan has suggested that standard names should be used to
<br />
describe the content of variables that relate to the physical world while
<br />
standard_metadata would describe how the data were produced (i.e., details of a
<br />
model or observing system).  Jonathan (23rd October) has suggested that it is
<br />
not always straightforward to decide whether something should be a standard name
<br />
or standard metadata, so it would be better not introduce the standard_metadata
<br />
vocabulary.
<br />
<br />The upshot of this is that there are actually three alternative approaches on
<br />
the table, rather than the two detailed in my summary:
<br />
(1) use standard names for ensemble metadata;
<br />
(2) use standard names to describe physical variables, for metadata use
<br />
external vocabularies where possible and introduce a new CF vocabulary called
<br />
standard_metadata for situations where a suitable external vocabulary does not
<br />
exist;
<br />
(3) use external vocabularies for metadata where possible and add new standard
<br />
names where a suitable external vocabulary does not exist.
<br />
<br />Clearly there needs to be a decision on which approach to take before any
<br />
specific proposals can be taken forward.  On balance, it seems I was premature
<br />
in declaring the issue completely closed as far as standard names are
<br />
concerned.  However, I would certainly say that the standard name proposals are
<br />
&quot;on hold&quot; pending a decision on strategy.
<br />
<br />It remains my impression that external vocabularies are generally agreed to be
<br />
a useful tool, albeit one that should be used with care.  For ensembles in
<br />
particular, my understanding is that no suitable external vocabulary exists, so
<br />
in this instance we will need to add the metadata within CF.  All
<br />
of which leaves one question: do we want to introduce a new attribute called
<br />
standard_metadata, with an associated vocabulary, or do we want to add metadata
<br />
names as standard names?  I would still argue that this is really a conventions
<br />
issue at the moment, rather than a standard names issue, and that it deserves
<br />
as wide a discussion as possible.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
