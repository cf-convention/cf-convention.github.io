<br />
Dear all
<br />
<br />I think Steve is right that when making a proposal for change we have to start
<br />
with a requirement. This is of course normally done in some informal way as a
<br />
motivation, but sometimes being more explicit would help. I would suggest this
<br />
as a requirement:
<br />
<br />A data variable may have a dimension which serves as an index over the members
<br />
of an ensemble, in which the ensemble members are derived from different
<br />
models, integrations, institutions supplying the data, etc., and the data from
<br />
each ensemble member is a function of the same spatiotemporal coordinates
<br />
and/or other physical independent variables. A means is needed to provide
<br />
metadata identifying the ensemble members. This metadata serves as the
<br />
coordinate data for the index dimension over ensemble members.
<br />
<br />Here's my summary of how we have proposed to meet this requirement:
<br />
<br />We propose to allow auxiliary coordinate variables with the ensemble index
<br />
dimension to contain metadata identifying the institution, source,
<br />
experiment_id and realization of the data. institution and source are strings,
<br />
with the same meaning as the attributes of those names (CF 2.6.2).
<br />
experiment_id is a string describing the design or intent of the
<br />
integration. realization is either numeric or a string, and it distinguishes
<br />
integrations of a model which in other respects are identically specified and
<br />
constitute members of a statistical sample. Since these are auxiliary
<br />
coordinate variables, their values do not have to be unique or ordered.
<br />
<br />(Ensemble members might also be distinguished by different analysis or
<br />
verification times, in the forecasting sense of these terms. These can be
<br />
supplied as auxiliary coordinate variables with standard_names of
<br />
forecast_reference_time and time, and could be dimensioned with the ensemble
<br />
index dimension. This is not a new convention.)
<br />
<br />For consistency and completeness, I would propose also to allow experiment_id
<br />
and realization as attributes of data variables and as global attributes (i.e.
<br />
include them in CF 2.6.2), with the same meanings as they have for auxiliary
<br />
coordinate variables.
<br />
<br />The string-valued metadata should be as intelligible to humans, since the file
<br />
should be self-describing. If the purposes for which the data are intended
<br />
require the values of the string-valued metadata to be chosen from a standard
<br />
set, a table specifying the possible set should be made publicly available,
<br />
and a string-valued &quot;vocabulary&quot; attribute of the auxiliary coordinate
<br />
variable should supply its URL.
<br />
<br />Do we want to mandate the form of this table?
<br />
<br />I think/hope the above is agreeable to all in general, though there may be
<br />
some details in dispute. The main outstanding issue, as Alison and others have
<br />
said, is whether institution, source, and experiment_id should be the
<br />
standard_names of their auxiliary coordinate variables, or recorded in a new
<br />
attribute. I'd say the case that Steve has raised concerning names
<br />
for structural aspects of the grid is not part of this requirement for
<br />
identifying ensemble members; it's a different question.
<br />
<br />I think they should be standard_names, because
<br />
<br />* I can't think of a good distinction to be drawn between this kind of
<br />
information and other coordinate variables, so I suspect we would end up
<br />
spending time trying to draw an illusory distinction which can't be made
<br />
consistently. Referring to Steve's idea, it doesn't seem to me that the
<br />
requirement indicates they should be treated differently from realization,
<br />
forecast_reference_time and time, which are already allowed as standard_names.
<br />
<br />* if we use a different attribute, it means that software will have to look at
<br />
both alternatives, although it's usually going to treat the contents in the
<br />
same way.
<br />
<br />Here are some distinctions which *don't* seem to work well:
<br />
<br />* We could say string-valued things are not given standard names. But we have
<br />
region as a standard name with string values, identifying geographical areas
<br />
such as atlantic_ocean, for labelling the ocean overturning streamfunction.
<br />
This function is very similar to numerical geographical coordinates. It would
<br />
be strange to use standard name for latitude and longitude to describe a
<br />
rectangular region, but to say that the label for a non-rectangular region is
<br />
not a standard name. Similarly, land cover types have standard names. They are
<br />
labelling parts of gridboxes which aren't geographically delineated, so again
<br />
are acting as a sort of spatial coordinate.
<br />
<br />* Things which you aren't going to &quot;operate&quot; on are not standard names i.e.
<br />
they're just labels. However, possibly the commonest thing to do with the
<br />
numerical spatiotemporal coordinates is to subset them, and you may well do
<br />
that with the ensemble metadata too. It is also possibly you might combine
<br />
them or process them in other ways.
<br />
<br />* Quantities which could never be data variables should not be given standard
<br />
names. It does seem quite unlikely that source, institution and experiment_id
<br />
might form the contents of a data variable. (In fact it would be hard to do
<br />
until netCDF-4, since they are string-valued, but it could be done using
<br />
flag_values and flag_meanings.) But I don't think it's impossible. I can
<br />
imagine constructing a lat-lon field which indicates which model, at each
<br />
point, had the most realistic value of a quantity, for example.
<br />
<br />But perhaps someone can think of a better distinction which would naturally
<br />
seem part of the requirement.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
