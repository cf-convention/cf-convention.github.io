Dear Bert, John, Steve et al.
<br />
<br />Bert's requirement is to provide one or more pairs of auxiliary 2D projection
<br />
coordinates which can be derived by a grid mapping from latitude and longitude
<br />
x(latitude,longitude), y(latitude,longitude). This requires an extension to the
<br />
existing standard, which only supports grid mappings in which the projection
<br />
coordinates are the 1D coordinate variables of the data variable.
<br />
<br />Three conventions have been proposed to record this information in the netCDF
<br />
file at <a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/wiki/MultipleProjections">http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/wiki/MultipleProjections</a>. Alternatively,
<br />
it has been suggested that the 2D projection coordinates could be computed by a
<br />
server instead of recording them in the file.
<br />
<br />All three proposed conventions provide a way of associating the grid_mapping
<br />
with the 2D projection coordinates. This is necessary because projection
<br />
coordinates are georeferenced only by specifying the mapping. These are my
<br />
views of the three proposals:
<br />
<br />John's proposal introduces a coordinate system variable which is
<br />
separate from the data variable. The coordinate system variable points to the
<br />
grid mapping and the projection coordinates. The data variable points to one or
<br />
more coordinate system variables. The advantage of this is that it directly
<br />
associates the grid mapping and the projection coordinates, and it saves having
<br />
to make the same association on every data variable. I would say that this is
<br />
an attractive idea, and it is quite natural to introduce this abstraction as a
<br />
way of interpreting the file. However, I think it would be inconsistent to
<br />
separate the coordinate system from the data variable *only* in this rather
<br />
specialised case, while we do not do it in the commoner situations where the
<br />
coordinate system is defined by the 1D coordinate variables, or by 2D lat-lon
<br />
auxiliary coordinate variables. Also, this abstraction may make the file harder
<br />
to understand and to use by simple programs or inexpert users. Users are
<br />
accustomed to seeing the coordinates attached to the data variable, which seems
<br />
an obvious approach.
<br />
<br />Jonathan's proposal retains the grid mapping as an attribute of the data
<br />
variable, as in the present standard, and introduces an alternative format for
<br />
it, allowing it to specify the 2D projection coordinates in association with
<br />
the grid mapping, for more than one projection. The advantage of this is that
<br />
there is minimal change to the way the file is interpreted; the grid mapping is
<br />
found in the same place as in the existing convention, which I think we have
<br />
to retain because of backward compatibility, and needs only to be parsed in a
<br />
new way. (If preferable to supporting two formats for one attribute, we could
<br />
instead introduce a new differently named attribute of the data variable.) The
<br />
drawback is that the association between mapping and coordinates is made
<br />
independently on every data variable, but this is consistent in principle with
<br />
all the other kinds of coordinate system: we provide the same 1D coordinates or
<br />
2D lat-lon coordinates for every data variable that needs them.
<br />
<br />Bert's proposal has the data variable point to the 2D projection coordinates
<br />
via the coordinates attribute used for auxiliary coordinate variables. The
<br />
grid mapping becomes an attribute of 2D projection coordinate variables; each
<br />
such variable points to its grid mapping. The advantages of this are that the
<br />
association between grid mapping and projection coordinates does not have to
<br />
be made for every data variable independently, and that the grid mapping
<br />
attribute does not need a new format. The drawbacks are that software would
<br />
have to look in two different places for the grid mapping attribute (either on
<br />
the data variable or on the auxiliary coordinate variables), and that the
<br />
grid mapping is specified on *both* of the 2D projection coordinates for each
<br />
projection. If they happened to be different by accident, the file would be
<br />
broken.
<br />
<br />Please comment on the above summary. If there are many comments, we could
<br />
perhaps compile them on the wiki. I hope that a summary of the arguments might
<br />
provide the necessary information for more people to consider the question and
<br />
make a decision.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
