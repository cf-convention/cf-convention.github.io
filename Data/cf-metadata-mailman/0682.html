Hi Karl,
<br />
<br />This is excellent news.  I am completely in agreement that there is a
<br />
need
<br />
to get the committees up and running as soon as possible.
<br />
<br />Currently, one of the hardest things in my role as standard names
<br />
manager is 
<br />
deciding when a community consensus has actually been reached.  There
<br />
have 
<br />
been occasions when a mailing list discussion has apparently petered out
<br />
and 
<br />
I have moved to bring the discussion formally towards a close, only to
<br />
find 
<br />
that this has caused concern and prompted another flurry of activity.  
<br />
Generally speaking, I am pleased if my interventions prompt discussion -
<br />
it 
<br />
is part of my job to keep things moving - but there does need to be a
<br />
way of 
<br />
drawing a line so that debates don't drift on indefinitely without ever 
<br />
reaching a conclusion.  Clearly there has to be a balance between
<br />
allowing 
<br />
the community ample opportunity to express their views and the need, 
<br />
ultimately, to make decisions.
<br />
<br />I very much hope that input from committee members will help move things
<br />
<br />forward - it is simply not possible for one individual acting as
<br />
standard 
<br />
names manager to be an expert in every scientific field where CF might
<br />
be 
<br />
used.  I echo your encouragement to committee members, and indeed to
<br />
others, 
<br />
to involve themselves wherever possible in the mailing list discussions.
<br />
If 
<br />
only two or three people join in the discussion of a particular subject,
<br />
as 
<br />
often happens now, it is difficult to be confident that the views of the
<br />
<br />community as a whole are being reflected.  I would very much welcome the
<br />
<br />opportunity to meet members of both committees at the next GO-ESSP
<br />
meeting 
<br />
as I am sure that would assist us in working together.
<br />
<br />Recently I have given a lot of thought to the timing of updates to the 
<br />
standard name table.  Something that committee members and the CF
<br />
community 
<br />
in general should be aware of is that I have a somewhat atypical working
<br />
pattern, which impacts on my availability to perform updates.  Also,
<br />
recent 
<br />
experience has taught me that it often takes many weeks for standard
<br />
names 
<br />
to be agreed and if there is a schedule of monthly updates there may
<br />
well be 
<br />
occasions when there are no new names to add.  Balanced against this is
<br />
the 
<br />
need to avoid long delays in adding names once agreement has been
<br />
reached.
<br />
<br />Based on the considerations outlined above, I propose to update the
<br />
standard 
<br />
name table on a bi-monthly basis.  Updates will be performed on the
<br />
second 
<br />
Tuesday of the month in January, March, May, July, September and
<br />
November.  
<br />
I hope that having definite dates for change, published in advance, will
<br />
<br />help to expedite the process of adding agreed names.  Users of the table
<br />
<br />will also benefit by knowing when they need to check for updates.
<br />
<br />The reasons for arriving at the above timetable are essentially
<br />
pragmatic, 
<br />
based on the timing of major public holidays in the UK and my own
<br />
working pattern.  I have designed it in this way because I believe there
<br />
is a 
<br />
realistic chance of my being able to deliver it.  I think it is
<br />
preferable 
<br />
to schedule less frequent updates, and actually perform them, than to 
<br />
promise a monthly schedule and not be able to deliver.
<br />
<br />By way of background, I should explain that I am employed at BADC on a
<br />
part-
<br />
time basis and over a calendar year my working hours constitute just
<br />
over 
<br />
fifty per cent of full time.  However, the majority of my working hours
<br />
are 
<br />
condensed into the term-time periods of UK schools.  During school
<br />
vacations 
<br />
I usually work the equivalent of only one day per week.  The bi-monthly 
<br />
schedule deliberately avoids the periods when UK schools would normally
<br />
be 
<br />
closed for any length of time.  I have chosen the second Tuesday of the 
<br />
month to allow for the fact that most UK public holidays occur on a
<br />
Monday.  
<br />
It also avoids the possibility of updates falling due on New Year's Day
<br />
and 
<br />
during Easter (both public holidays in the UK).
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject: Invitation to serve on the CF Standard Name Committee
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Friend of CF:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At its last meeting in September, the WGCM (Working Group on Coupled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Modeling) formally accepted responsibility for promoting the CF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventions across WCRP (World Climate Research Programme) programs
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; providing a home for the conventions within the scientific community.
</em><br />
I
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been asked by the WGCM to serve as chair of the Governance Panel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the CF conventions, but unfortunately the panel itself has not yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been appointed.  Nevertheless, given the current active discussion on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the CF mail list, there is a need to activate the &quot;Standard Name&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Conventions&quot; committees.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Until the CF Governance Panel convenes and can formally appoint these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two committees, I hope you will consent to serve as an &quot;acting&quot; member
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so we can move forward.  I trust that the Governance Panel will
</em><br />
concur,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since you all have generously volunteered to serve and provide a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; valuable service to our community.  Judging from the ongoing email
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion, interest in the CF conventions is continuing to increase,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it is clear that official involvement of committee members is now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Recently, Jonathan Gregory, Steve Hankin, Bryan Lawrence and I held a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preliminary discussion on how the process of arriving at modifications
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the CF convention might be improved, which is the business of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conventions Committee.  We developed a straw man that I will post
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separately to the CF email list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Modifications to the standard names table are being facilitated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alison Pamment, the manager of standard names employed by the BADC,
</em><br />
who
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has taken on the role of summarising and moderating debates about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposals for changes.  She aims to make updates to the standard name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; table about once a month, reflecting the conclusions of these debates.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An important reason for convening the committees was to engage a
</em><br />
larger
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; group in the debates.  In order to reach the best conclusions, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful to have several people considering each issue. We would
</em><br />
therefore
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to encourage you to get involved in any of the ongoing
</em><br />
discussions
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as far as your time allows, as part of the role of committee
</em><br />
membership.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In addition we are hoping to reserve one day of the next GO-ESSP
</em><br />
meeting
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to discuss CF and to allow for face-to-face meetings of the two CF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; committees. We expect the meeting to be held in Paris in early June,
</em><br />
but
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; firms dates are not yet available.  I hope most of you will be able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participate in that meeting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I invite your ideas about the above. Please could you comment to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; email list rather than replying to this email, as we think it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important for discussion about CF governance to take place in public.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks very much for volunteering your time for this (almost) noble
</em><br />
cause.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sincerely,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Karl Taylor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P.S. Thanks to Jonathan Gregory, Steve Hankin, and Bryan Lawrence for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their input to this invitation.
