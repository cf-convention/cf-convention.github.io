<br />
Dear all,
<br />
<br />At its last meeting in September, the WGCM (Working Group on Coupled 
<br />
Modeling) formally accepted responsibility for promoting the CF 
<br />
conventions across WCRP (World Climate Research Programme) programs and 
<br />
providing a home for the conventions within the scientific community. I 
<br />
have been asked by the WGCM to serve as chair of the Governance Panel 
<br />
for the CF conventions, but unfortunately the panel itself has not yet 
<br />
been appointed.  Nevertheless, given the current active discussion on 
<br />
the CF mail list, showing that interest in the CF conventions is 
<br />
continuing to increase, there is a need to activate the &quot;Standard Name&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;Conventions&quot; committees proposed by the CF &quot;white paper&quot;
<br />
<a href="http://home.badc.rl.ac.uk/lawrence/cf/papers/MaintainingAndAdvancingCF.pdf">http://home.badc.rl.ac.uk/lawrence/cf/papers/MaintainingAndAdvancingCF.pdf</a> 
<br />
The original CF authors have invited a number of people to serve on 
<br />
these committees, whom we hope will serve as &quot;acting&quot; members until the 
<br />
CF Governance Panel convenes and can formally appoint them. (The 
<br />
committees can subsequently propose further members.)
<br />
<br />Recently, Jonathan Gregory, Steve Hankin, Bryan Lawrence and I held a
<br />
preliminary discussion on how the process of arriving at modifications 
<br />
to the CF convention might be improved.  We arrived at the following 
<br />
straw man that we felt will help to create a more effective CF 
<br />
advancement process.
<br />
<br />* New issues will be opened, discussed and resolved through a process 
<br />
outlined in a Web (Wiki) template. The template will ensure that 
<br />
discussions meet a minimal standard of completeness and that they leave 
<br />
behind a readable record of the reasoning used to reach conclusions.
<br />
<br />* Every CF issue must have a responsible moderator.  Initially 
<br />
individual Conventions Committee members will need to volunteer to be 
<br />
moderators and assume responsibility for leading the discussion to a 
<br />
consensus-driven conclusion.  The job of the moderator would involve i) 
<br />
reading all of the emails on the topic that you are moderating; ii) 
<br />
enforcing some simple rules; iii) summarizing conclusions from the email 
<br />
discussions on a web page; iv) bringing the discussion to a conclusion 
<br />
which reflects the consensus and has minimum dissent. In cases where the 
<br />
discussion ends with irreconcilable points of view, the committee 
<br />
chairman will decide whether to ask the committee to decide the issue by 
<br />
a vote.
<br />
<br />Modifications to the standard names table are being facilitated by 
<br />
Alison Pamment, the manager of standard names employed by the BADC, who 
<br />
has taken on the role of summarising and moderating debates about 
<br />
proposals for changes. She aims to make updates to the standard name 
<br />
table about once a month, reflecting the conclusions of these debates.
<br />
<br />We are hoping to reserve one day of the next GO-ESSP meeting to discuss 
<br />
CF and to allow for face-to-face meetings of the two CF committees.  We 
<br />
expect the meeting to be held in Paris in early June, but firms dates 
<br />
are not yet available.
<br />
<br />We would like to encourage everyone with an interest to get involved in 
<br />
any of the ongoing discussions as far as time allows. It is important 
<br />
for good decision-making and wide acceptance of CF that all proposals 
<br />
are throughly debated.
<br />
<br />We invite your ideas about the above.
<br />
<br />Sincerely yours,
<br />
<br />Karl Taylor (with thanks to Jonathan Gregory, Steve Hankin and Bryan 
<br />
Lawrence for their substantial input).
