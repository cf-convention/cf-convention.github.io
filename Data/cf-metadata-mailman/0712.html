<br />
Dear Jonathan, Roy, Nan and Tom,
<br />
<br />sorry for the slow response on this - I am working only a few hours this week
<br />
due to school holidays.
<br />
<br />When I raised the subject of reaching decisions I certainly did not mean to
<br />
suggest that we should impose rigid or arbitrary time limits on the process of
<br />
agreeing new standard names.  Thus far I have adopted a pragmatic approach in
<br />
which threads that are clearly actively under discussion have been left to run
<br />
until, hopefully, a consensus is reached at which point the names have been
<br />
listed for inclusion in the table.  I see no particular reason to alter that
<br />
approach.  Indeed, there can be very good reasons why a discussion takes a long
<br />
time, for example, to allow for consultation with experts outside the CF
<br />
community as is happening currently with the aerosols and chemistry proposals.
<br />
I feel very strongly that it would be a mistake to cut short efforts to agree
<br />
names on a sound scientific basis purely in the interests of speeding up the
<br />
process.
<br />
<br />A problem arises when a thread has been dormant for a while, say two or three
<br />
weeks without any postings.  In that case it is tempting to think that the
<br />
discussion has run its course and that people are happy to proceed with whatever
<br />
position was reached before the postings stopped.  However, I have learned that
<br />
it is dangerous to assume under those circumstances that anything has actually
<br />
been agreed!  To a great extent I think the responsibility for restarting
<br />
stalled discussions lies with me, through prompting for posts on the mailing
<br />
list and/or contacting proposers directly.  I agree with Roy's suggestion that
<br />
we could have a &quot;guillotine date&quot; where, after prompting and if no further
<br />
comments have been received, we can either proceed on the basis of what has
<br />
already been discussed or agree to drop the proposals from further discussion.
<br />
The committee would need to decide which course of action to take.  If
<br />
proposals were dropped there would be nothing to prevent them being reintroduced
<br />
at a later date but they would then have to go through the whole process again
<br />
from the beginning.
<br />
<br />Another major benefit of having the committee comes if a discussion has reached
<br />
a point where there is no overall consensus and no clear way forward. This
<br />
situation does arise on occasion, often because there are only two or three
<br />
participants in a particular conversation each advancing a different opinion.
<br />
Under those circumstances it does not seem appropriate for me, acting as an
<br />
individual, simply to impose a decision on the community by opting for one
<br />
particular point of view.  That is especially true if the topic under discussion
<br />
is outside my own area of scientific knowledge.  I do think it is likely that
<br />
there will be a need to ask the committee to vote from time to time.
<br />
<br />Having looked after standard names for some months now I am gradually learning
<br />
through experience how to manage more smoothly at least some aspects of the
<br />
process.  I have learned that I do need to be pro-active in keeping things
<br />
moving and publishing the schedule of planned updates is one step towards this.
<br />
Another step is to announce in advance of an update the names that are planned
<br />
for inclusion - this alerts people to the fact that a change is about to take
<br />
place and also gives them one last chance to air any objections to the names
<br />
going forward.  The last point is important because names, once included in the
<br />
table, are not taken out again so there is a clear need to avoid making
<br />
erroneous or only semi-agreed additions.  Based on recent experience, I think
<br />
that names planned for inclusion should be announced two weeks in advance of an
<br />
update.  In the past I have given a week's notice but giving the extra time
<br />
makes some allowance for the possibility of people being on leave, attending
<br />
conferences, etc.
<br />
<br />Regarding the use of trac, I agree with Jonathan's comments.  Certainly my hope
<br />
is that having separate tickets will make it easier to monitor progress on
<br />
different issues.  Life may get complicated if people change subject headings or
<br />
raise new tickets part way through a conversation as sometimes happens now on
<br />
the mailing list.  There is bound to be an associated learning curve.  However,
<br />
I think the timescales for the standard names process are definitely something
<br />
that can only be arrived at by discussion and my gut feeling is that they will
<br />
vary between one set of proposals and another, even if that is within an agreed
<br />
framework.
<br />
<br />There are other comments I could make regarding the standard names process, but
<br />
I think that is enough from me for now.  I am pleased that we are having this
<br />
conversation and I do hope that we can at least agree some guidelines for how
<br />
the committee will work.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
