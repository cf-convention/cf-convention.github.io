<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Steve and Balaji,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for bringing back the issue of CF and the ensemble axis.
</em><br />
<br />Paco, Thank you for your patience. I'm sorry this is taking a while to
<br />
settle, but I think it's a key new feature and we needed some time to
<br />
digest the implications. I really want to come up with a solution to
<br />
this problem, as GFDL is ready with datasets to submit to ENSEMBLES,
<br />
and we are mainly waiting to finalize the issue of what metadata to
<br />
place in the netCDF files.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The original proposal concerned multi-forecast system ensembles. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; includes initial-condition ensembles, perturbed-parameter ensembles and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-models. It is likely that the first two systems have the same grid in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the forecasts, because they would be generated by the same model version.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wouldn't call these examples a limited sub-case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Solving the question of how to handle multiple grids in the same file before 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introducing the ensemble dimension would be ideal, but in the meantime the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dissemination of standard NetCDF files with all sorts of ensembles forecasts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is limited.
</em><br />
<br />I understand that in the first two cases, initial-condition and
<br />
perturbed-parameter, it is very likely that all the models will be on
<br />
the same grid, and have the same provenance (though that &quot;very likely&quot;
<br />
might be changing as we do more and more cross-model forecast
<br />
ensembles...). In the last case, multi-model or heterogeneous
<br />
ensembles, the models might be quite different. I'd like to think of
<br />
the ENSEMBLES project as an example of the first,
<br />
climateprediction.net as an example of the second, and IPCC AR4 as an
<br />
example of the third, to see how we might want to represent ensembles
<br />
in these three instances.
<br />
<br />For each of these three examples, let's take a look at something you
<br />
might want to do by way of analyzing the ensemble data.
<br />
<br />- For the first case, the question is something like, &quot;Is the ensemble
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mean forecast of some quantity better (i.e lower global RMS error)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than any individual forecast?&quot; Such a question can clearly be well
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered using an array t(x,y,z,t,n) where n is the ensemble ID, if
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the ensemble members are to be included, they're all on the same
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grid, and so on. If the question becomes more complicated, e.g, &quot;can
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we further improve the skill by omitting from the ensemble the 5
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members whose _individual_ RMS error is the worst?&quot; At this point
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are eliminating some random selection of points along the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensemble axis. This operation is no longer &quot;hyperslabbing&quot; but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;subsetting&quot; in some more general sense.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other technical issues with this approach that also
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worry me. One is that netCDF-3 only supports one UNLIMITED
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dimension. If that's the time axis, is the number of ensemble
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members going to be fixed at initialization? Is that practical?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, related issue, is of filesize. One record, i.e a single
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slice along the UNLIMTITED axis of a single variable, is stored as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one contiguous hypercube of all the other dimensions. As of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;netCDF3.6, this record can be no larger than 4GB. Is it practical to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work within this limit for the ensemble experiments we are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considering, if there were an ensemble axis?
<br />
<br />- In the second case (climateprediction.net) the question is something
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like, &quot;what range of parameter P among the 100,000-member ensemble
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivers the maximum climate sensitivity&quot;? Again, the answer is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;achieved not by hyperslabbing, but by subsetting based on some
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outcome in an analysis.
<br />
<br />- The third case is like the second, only more so...: a standard query
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we've been using in our thought experiments is &quot;give me the surface
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature field from all 20C3M scenarios in the IPCC AR4 archive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where volcanoes are turned OFF.&quot; This involves some fairly
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sophisticated SQL-type processing (and in fact requires 'human
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasoning agents' at present...:-), which I honestly believe is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond the scope of what can be stored in simple netCDF file
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;headers.
<br />
<br />Paco, I'm worried about the current proposal for the reasons outlined.
<br />
What I think I've learnt is that: a 'dimension' is useful for
<br />
'hyperslabbing'. Ensemble processing is usually accompanied by
<br />
'subsetting' which is much more general than 'hyperslabbing' and may
<br />
involve processing of many layers of metadata. These are very likely
<br />
in some higher-level relational model whose 'records' may not map very
<br />
well onto netCDF's current model of a 'record'.
<br />
<br />I propose, instead, something more minimalist. IPCC AR4 has two
<br />
requirements of global attributes, 'experiment' and 'realization'.
<br />
Could I suggest that for the moment we can use something like this:
<br />
two levels of nomenclature that identifies the collection or ensemble
<br />
to which the dataset belongs, and second, an unique ID for each member
<br />
within that ensemble. (The 'realization' or 'ensemble_member' string
<br />
itself does not have to be unique, as we can combine this with other
<br />
provenance information to generate a unique ensemble member ID).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My message is that there is a demand for standardized NetCDF ensemble 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forecast files. Shouldn't the adoption of a CF standard to write those files 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depend on when an alternative, more adequate solution is available?
</em><br />
<br />I really believe that at this point, this is as far as we can go. In a
<br />
few years, with more experience of routinely working with multi-model
<br />
ensembles we can invent a better way of expressing ourselves. Would
<br />
the proposal above satisfy in some fashion the demand for an 'ensemble
<br />
forecast dataset (note: not file)'? I believe a THREDDS catalogue can
<br />
be configured to permit the kinds of aggregation you have implemented,
<br />
working off combinations of global attribute settings to generate an
<br />
ensemble dataset.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
