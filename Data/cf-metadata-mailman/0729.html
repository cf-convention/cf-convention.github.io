<br />
Dear all
<br />
<br />Many people have made thoughtful contributions to this discussion. My
<br />
impression is that through the earlier discussions we reached a consensus on
<br />
a convention for handling ensembles. There was one exception to this, namely
<br />
the issue of whether to use the standard_name attribute for new purposes, or
<br />
define an alternative attribute, but that issue doesn't affect the structure
<br />
proposed. This convention introduces an extra dimension and allow a combination
<br />
of auxiliary coordinate variables to identify the ensemble members along that
<br />
dimension. The convention is adequate for some needs that already exist. That
<br />
is why Paco raised the requirement in the first place. Balaji gives two use-
<br />
cases for it. The combination of auxiliary coordinates is really doing the job
<br />
of the &quot;lower-level&quot; identification (members within the ensemble) that Balaji
<br />
describes, but early on in the previous discussion it appeared useful to have
<br />
this factorised into various attributes rather than in a single string.
<br />
<br />I agree that because this axis doesn't have a meaningful monotonic coordinate
<br />
variable, you can't extract a range from it. That's because it's discrete, not
<br />
continuous. This is not an unprecedented situation. If you have a data variable
<br />
containing timeseries or vertical profiles at scattered points, or trajectories
<br />
from a number of parcels, you will have a similar kind of index dimension, with
<br />
auxiliary coordinates providing locations and other identification. You can
<br />
usefully subset such an axis, as people have commented. Subsetting may be a bit
<br />
more awkward for analysis softare, but it is an essential operation. You might
<br />
do it with continuous axes as well (e.g. to extract the Januaries from a time 
<br />
axis of months).
<br />
<br />It is also a limitation that the data have to be on the same space-time grid.
<br />
For many analysis operations, however, this is necessary, even if the data were
<br />
not generated like that. In Balaji's case of the AR4 archive, the models do not
<br />
have the same grid. It is necessary to put them on a common grid nonetheless in
<br />
order to produce some familiar diagnostics such as appear in the AR4 and recent
<br />
papers, like the average lat-lon field of surface temperature change, or the
<br />
time-depth field of ocean temperature change averaged over models with
<br />
volcanoes. Even if the archive did not originally hold that data like that, I
<br />
am sure that somewhere along the way the ensemble dimension will be needed.
<br />
<br />In regard to John's point, it's true that models don't generate all the same
<br />
quantities. But one purpose of standard names is to indicate which quantities
<br />
can be regarded as equivalent among models. You would put surface temperature
<br />
from various models in a single data variable with an ensemble dimension if
<br />
the data variables from the various models already had the same standard_name.
<br />
<br />It is certainly true that it would be good to have a solution that *could*
<br />
deal with data on different grids. We can't do that with the proposal we have
<br />
now. It may well be that netCDF-4 will offer a good technical solution for
<br />
that. However, I don't think we ought to wait for it. We have a good solution
<br />
now for cases which are of immediate practical relevance. If we find later that
<br />
a more general solution is efficient for these cases too, we can support both.
<br />
That would be fine. CF is always going to evolve for new needs and technology.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
