Hi Folks, especially Balaji and Steve
<br />
<br />I'll make some general comments, and then take Balaji's questions.
<br />
<br />Firstly,  Thredds has nothing to do with this issue, and that's my point
<br />
from the November email, and which I was restating in reply to Steve's
<br />
point. If we have to appeal to *any* external *software* package to
<br />
define our metadata, then our convention is broken. (However, I have no
<br />
problem with appealing to external *definitions* of internal
<br />
identifiers.)
<br />
<br />Secondly, netcdf4 is also a red herring, because folk have to use
<br />
netcdf3 now, and will have to do so for a while to come. (Further, I
<br />
can't seriously believe that on the one hand we have an argument that
<br />
adding another axis is an engineering problem, but using a different API
<br />
to the persistence format is not ... both ways, software will need
<br />
adjustment, but in the former case we are working on top of a known and
<br />
reliable persistence format. I can tell you for a fact that we wont be
<br />
accepting netcdf4 data in 2007 for the BADC ... not  because I don't
<br />
like it, but because it has not yet got a track record!).
<br />
<br />So where does that leave us? 
<br />
* It leaves us with certain classes of ensemble data, that we have
<br />
available a priori (i.e. at file writing time), and that can be stored
<br />
in files in a certain way, and these are the ones that we are proposing
<br />
a solution for. These work fine with the proposed solution.
<br />
* there are also classes of ensemble data that we might what to
<br />
aggregate a postiori (i.e we don't have them at file write time, or that
<br />
cannot be stored into an array which has the same underlying coordinate
<br />
system). Well frankly, how is that different from *any* other existing
<br />
situation? (The Unified Model 4.5 had P and UV on different grids, but
<br />
we can still put them in the same file, I could even put them in the
<br />
same file with an ensemble axis for each). I can always find an example
<br />
where I want to add more data to a file later which isn't in the time
<br />
dimension (so I rewrite the file). Ensembles are simply not special in
<br />
this regard!
<br />
<br />(Aggregation servers are a red herring, in the final analysis, what I
<br />
get from aggregation servers are files, so let's care about the
<br />
persistence format, not the interface definition).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is the ensemble axis static? (i.e not UNLIMITED)? What happens if I want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to increase the size of an ensemble later? (We recently added 2 members
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a 3-member initial-condition ensemble we've submitted to IPCC AR4).
</em><br />
<br />So rewrite the data, but nobody is saying you *have* to have ensembles
<br />
all in one file, just as you don't rely on having all the variables in
<br />
one file. In the latter case, for sure one needs external information to
<br />
make the links, but let's not appeal to any *specific* software to do
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the kinds of ensembles we have in mind, can we stay within the file
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; size limits?
</em><br />
<br />No one is arguing that 1 file = 1 dataset.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I certainly wasn't meaning to suggest, or even imply, any software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choices or aggregation methods to go along with this. This is a comment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about metadata only.
</em><br />
<br />Fair enough, I agree with your perspective.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
Bryan
