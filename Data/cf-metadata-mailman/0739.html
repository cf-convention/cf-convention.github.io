Hi Bryan et. al.,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Please accept my bowing and scraping in advance here both for being
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long and wordy and for any appearance of being preachy.  Assertions
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like &quot;THREDDS has nothing to do with this issue&quot; and &quot;Aggregation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servers are a red herring&quot; illustrate such a fundamental divergence
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in perceptions that I feel compelled to go back to the history of CF
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and our fundamentals.]
<br />
<br />It is wise that we have chosen to schedule a full day on CF for our 
<br />
GO-ESSP meeting this summer, because we have some fundamental (and 
<br />
probably difficult) issues to reach agreement on.  For a very large 
<br />
fraction of the CF community  &quot;files&quot; were supplanted by aggregations as 
<br />
the foundation of netCDF data management a very long time ago.   In 
<br />
Ferret this happened in 1995.  GrADS I think was a little earlier.  CDAT 
<br />
and NCL probably around this time, too.   I'm sure there have been 
<br />
plenty of other application-specific aggregation solutions developed, 
<br />
too ... also probably a long time ago.
<br />
<br />The fact that so many applications separately developed solutions is a 
<br />
clear indication that aggregation is a fundamental need.  I have to 
<br />
assume, Bryan, that when you referred to aggregation servers as a red 
<br />
herring your emphasis is on the &quot;server&quot; part (which I will get to).  
<br />
Because the need for aggregation with CF data seems inescapable.
<br />
<br />The fact that so many applications separately developed solutions is 
<br />
also a clear indication of inefficiency.  Group after group developing 
<br />
the same capability ....  That's why it made so much sense when Unidata 
<br />
released a fully integrated aggregation solution in 2001 ... and many 
<br />
enhancements to it since then (the entire NcML framework).  For those 
<br />
lucky enough to be programming in Java, this was a transparent solution 
<br />
for aggregating local files.  For those using C or C-dependent code the 
<br />
aggregations were available only through OPeNDAP connections.  Here we 
<br />
see a hole and the beginning of a parting of the ways, since some parts 
<br />
of the community found OPeNDAP to be excellent.  Other parts found it 
<br />
unacceptable.  Arguably it is that parting of the ways that lies at the 
<br />
heart of our differing outlooks on ensembles today.  I would note, 
<br />
however, that at the last GO-ESSP meeting we made a group commitment to 
<br />
the development of a C library that will capture the richness of what 
<br />
Java access to netCDF offers -- hopefully including the entire NcML 
<br />
framework for aggregation.
<br />
<br />These dates -- 1995, 2001 -- are ancient history.  Since then &quot;service 
<br />
oriented&quot; concepts have come to dominate our discussions.  (E.g. 
<br />
server-side transformation capabilities on CF files are now bread and 
<br />
butter discussion topics.)  THREDDS is one example of a service-oriented 
<br />
approach.  Just as aggregation allowed us to replace files with a higher 
<br />
order abstraction -- the dataset -- the service oriented abstractions 
<br />
allow us to handle collections of datasets as single entities.  Some may 
<br />
like THREDDS.  Others may not.  Discussion of the trade-offs ought to be 
<br />
happening.  But it is an extreme rhetorical stand to say that it has 
<br />
&quot;nothing to do with the problem&quot;.
<br />
<br />The power of the service-oriented approach _has everything to do_ with 
<br />
the options available for handling ensembles.  If we accept that 
<br />
THREDDS-like metadata catalogs are within the scope of CF discussions, 
<br />
then we open a huge and fertile domain for solving problems in ways that 
<br />
are 100% harmonious with the current CF usage.  If we reject the 
<br />
discussion of catalogs, then we are forced to pile greater and greater 
<br />
complexity into the body of our CF files, muddying fundamental CF 
<br />
concepts and ultimately providing only a partial solution to the 
<br />
ensemble problem.
<br />
<br />Conclusion:  I reject the assertion that discussion of catalog level 
<br />
metadata is out of bounds.  One could as well argue that the ensemble 
<br />
problem, itself is out of bounds.  When we confront fundamental new 
<br />
problems in CF, we may need to introduce fundamental new tools.   _The 
<br />
catalog is the natural place in the CF data model for the concept of an 
<br />
ensemble to exist_.  Currently there has been no proposal placed on the 
<br />
table to handle multi-grid ensembles.  (Clearly THREDDS offers some 
<br />
obvious directions).  We're treating the multi-grid problem like the 
<br />
elephant in the living room.  Lets address it and see where that leads 
<br />
our thinking.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Secondly, netcdf4 is also a red herring, because folk have to use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; netcdf3 now, and will have to do so for a while to come. (Further, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't seriously believe that on the one hand we have an argument that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adding another axis is an engineering problem, but using a different API
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the persistence format is not ... both ways, software will need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adjustment, but in the former case we are working on top of a known and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reliable persistence format. I can tell you for a fact that we wont be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepting netcdf4 data in 2007 for the BADC ... not  because I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like it, but because it has not yet got a track record!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So where does that leave us? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * It leaves us with certain classes of ensemble data, that we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; available a priori (i.e. at file writing time), and that can be stored
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in files in a certain way, and these are the ones that we are proposing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a solution for. These work fine with the proposed solution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * there are also classes of ensemble data that we might what to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aggregate a postiori (i.e we don't have them at file write time, or that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be stored into an array which has the same underlying coordinate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system). Well frankly, how is that different from *any* other existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation? (The Unified Model 4.5 had P and UV on different grids, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can still put them in the same file, I could even put them in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same file with an ensemble axis for each). I can always find an example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where I want to add more data to a file later which isn't in the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimension (so I rewrite the file). Ensembles are simply not special in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this regard!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Aggregation servers are a red herring, in the final analysis, what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get from aggregation servers are files, so let's care about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persistence format, not the interface definition).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is the ensemble axis static? (i.e not UNLIMITED)? What happens if I want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to increase the size of an ensemble later? (We recently added 2 members
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to a 3-member initial-condition ensemble we've submitted to IPCC AR4).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So rewrite the data, but nobody is saying you *have* to have ensembles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all in one file, just as you don't rely on having all the variables in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one file. In the latter case, for sure one needs external information to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make the links, but let's not appeal to any *specific* software to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For the kinds of ensembles we have in mind, can we stay within the file
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; size limits?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No one is arguing that 1 file = 1 dataset.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I certainly wasn't meaning to suggest, or even imply, any software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; choices or aggregation methods to go along with this. This is a comment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about metadata only.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fair enough, I agree with your perspective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cheers
