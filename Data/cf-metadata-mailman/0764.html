Dear Steve
<br />
<br />You make a specific suggestion that we could use a mandatory axis attribute to
<br />
identify ensemble axes. I think that's a useful idea. Although it should not be
<br />
difficult to use such an axis when you know which one it is, I agree that
<br />
identifying it could be tricky.
<br />
<br />You express many other concerns about the CF standard and its development. My
<br />
perception is quite different from yours. I think we have been rather careful
<br />
about the additions we make. It is not my impression that the standard has
<br />
suffered from &quot;instability and snow-balling complexity&quot;. We only add things
<br />
that people need. In doing that, we should try to anticipate obvious next steps
<br />
and generalisations which are very likely to be needed, but I do not think we
<br />
should hold up development because we cannot see the way to an all-encompassing
<br />
solution. Also, I don't understand the problem about unintelligibility by
<br />
existing applications. Pretty much all of CF is optional; only the COARDS core
<br />
is not. Old applications should simply be able to ignore new parts. They won't
<br />
be able to understand them, but they should not be broken by them. I think the
<br />
only significant departure from COARDS is the one which perhaps worries you
<br />
viz. in CF 2.4:
<br />
<br />&quot;A variable may have any number of dimensions, including zero, and the
<br />
dimensions must all have different names. COARDS strongly recommends limiting
<br />
the number of dimensions to four, but we wish to allow greater flexibility.&quot;
<br />
<br />Even COARDS does not forbid more than four dimensions. CF has had this
<br />
statement allowing more than four from its early drafts, whenever that was -
<br />
probably more then seven years ago - so suggesting a possible fifth dimension
<br />
for ensembles is hardly an innovation now.
<br />
<br />I agree with you that it is difficult to know we are making the best decisions
<br />
if few people express a view. On this particular thread (about the ensemble
<br />
axis) an unusually large number of people have expressed views, and that's
<br />
good. I would say there is a majority in favour of the proposal among those
<br />
who have contributed, but unanimity would be better than a majority. This is
<br />
not a new problem. We have convened the committees partly to engage more
<br />
people in the process. It could be that the silent majority sees no particular
<br />
problem with the proposal.
<br />
<br />My concern is that our decision-making presently is terribly slow. We have not
<br />
definitely enacted any change for more than three years, although we have in
<br />
effect agreed several on the email list. I don't think that's satisfactory. I
<br />
will try to find time to repropose the apparently agreed versions of some of
<br />
them through the Trac system, so that we have them clearly visible. But we do
<br />
need to agree reasonable timescales for making decisions, I think.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
