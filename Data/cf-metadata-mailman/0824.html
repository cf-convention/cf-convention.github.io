Hi all,
<br />
<br />A little more background about C-LAMP.  C-LAMP output is being written 
<br />
(rewritten?) through CMOR, so netCDF files are being produced that are 
<br />
to some extent compliant with CF.  I think the main problem is that 
<br />
certain &quot;standard_names&quot; have not yet been defined, and there are some 
<br />
standard_names that are incorrect.  I have copied an email I sent to the 
<br />
C-LAMP folks a week or two ago.  It lists some of the problems I found. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Some of you have found and commented on these same problems.)
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
Karl
<br />
<br />Dear Forrest,
<br />
<br />I have quickly looked over the list of your standard output fields for 
<br />
C-LAMP and have a few questions/comments/suggestions:
<br />
<br />1)  You should submit your proposed new standard names to the following 
<br />
CF discussion list: cf-metadata at cgd.ucar.edu.  After consideration by a 
<br />
broader group of individuals, the names will be approved or suggestions 
<br />
for modifications will be made.  I suggest, however, first that you 
<br />
consider 2-6 below:
<br />
<br />2) Different components of water vapor flux are requested as &quot;rates&quot; (in 
<br />
units of m s-1), which is admissible, but does involve some 
<br />
approximation concerning the density of water (which isn't constant). 
<br />
Fluxes (expressible as kg m-2 s-1, for example) are the primitive 
<br />
quantity (used by the model), and with some assumption about water 
<br />
density can be converted to a rate.  I recommend that such quantities as 
<br />
subsurface drainage, surface runoff, rainfall, snowfall, 
<br />
evapotranspiration, etc. all be expressed as fluxes.  You will be able 
<br />
to use available CF &quot;standard names&quot; and avoid petitioning for new 
<br />
names.  This would save both you and the &quot;standard name&quot; committee some 
<br />
time and also make your units exact and for some of these quantities 
<br />
consistent with the units required for the CMIP3 (IPCC AR4) archive at 
<br />
PCMDI.
<br />
<br />3) To avoid misunderstanding concerning the meaning of several 
<br />
quantities appearing in your list of standard output, it would be good 
<br />
to add notes concerning the definitions (following the example of the 
<br />
CMIP3 archive; see notes in the table at:
<br />
<a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/standard_output.html">http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/standard_output.html</a>).  In particular it 
<br />
will be important to specify whether quantities such as &quot;snow depth&quot; 
<br />
(surface_snow_thickness) are the thickness averaged over 1) the entire 
<br />
grid cell, 2) the land-portion of the grid cell, or 3) only the portion 
<br />
of the grid cell covered by snow.  For the CMIP3 standard output, we 
<br />
described monthly-mean surface_snow_thickness as follows:
<br />
<br />&quot;this thickness when multiplied by the average area of the grid cell 
<br />
covered by snow yields the time-mean snow volume.  Thus, for time means, 
<br />
compute as the weighted sum of thickness (averaged over the snow-covered 
<br />
portion of the grid cell) divided by the sum of the weights, with the 
<br />
weights equal to the area covered by snow;  report as 0.0 in snow-free 
<br />
regions.&quot;
<br />
<br />Similarly, monthly mean soil_moisture_content was described as:
<br />
<br />&quot;water in all phases summed over all soil layers, and averaged over the 
<br />
land portion of the grid cell (i.e., compute by dividing the total mass 
<br />
of water contained in the soil layer of the grid cell by the land area 
<br />
in the grid cell); report as &quot;missing&quot; or 0.0 where the land fraction is 0.&quot;
<br />
<br />Note, that if the land fraction is either 0. or 100%, then the ambiguity 
<br />
for this variable vanishes (i.e., dividing by the land area or the grid 
<br />
cell area would give the same result).
<br />
<br />4) For several variables, you request surface values, but at least in 
<br />
the case of atmospheric specific humidity (SPEC_HUM or QBOT) I wonder if 
<br />
that is a 2-meter quantity or a value right at the surface.  You also 
<br />
request SPEC_HUM_2M (Q2M) which clearly states at 2M.  As I understand 
<br />
it models produce the 2M value just to compare with observations, and 
<br />
they use the lowest model level specific humidity to calculate latent 
<br />
heat fluxes.  What is SPEC_HUM (QBOT) used for?
<br />
<br />5)  To be consistent with the CF conventions, all variables evaluated at 
<br />
2-meters above the surface should not include this location within the 
<br />
CF convention &quot;standard_name&quot; (i.e, the standard_name for 2m air 
<br />
temperature should be simply &quot;temperature&quot;, not 
<br />
&quot;surface_air_temperature_at_2m&quot;).  The quantity measured is temperature 
<br />
and the location should be stored in CF as a &quot;scalar coordinate&quot; using 
<br />
the &quot;coordinates attribute&quot; (see: 
<br />
<a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/CF-1.0.html#scalar_coords">http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/CF-1.0.html#scalar_coords</a>)
<br />
<br />Note that CMOR can be made to automatically store this information 
<br />
consistent with the CF conventions.
<br />
<br />6) You should double check your standard names for consistency with:
<br />
<a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/standard_name.html">http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/standard_name.html</a>
<br />
Note, for example, that for &quot;GROUND&quot; you list the standard name, 
<br />
&quot;downward_heat_flux_in_soil&quot;, but I think you want 
<br />
&quot;downward_heat_flux_at_ground_level_in_soil&quot;.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you have questions or if I can help out.  One can 
<br />
only hope that you will be rewarded by the avoidance of future problems 
<br />
if you continue to pay attention to these seemingly endless details.
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
Karl

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventions we've developed for the new Carbon-LAnd Model

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intercomparison Project (C-LAMP). To see these conventions, go to the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Developing a Common Set of Output Fields for the CCSM C-LAMP.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that C-LAMP presently involves just two or three versions of a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single model (the CCSM). As Pierre Friedlingstein has remarked, for some

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purposes it might be considered a pilot project for the next phase of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the larger Coupled Climate and Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Project (C4MIP). Accordingly, we do not intend to wait for a formal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; endorsement by the CF group before releasing C-LAMP output to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Working Group.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the same time, we welcome your suggestions on how the C-LAMP data 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventions could be improved. I have copied this message to other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interested parties who may not belong to the CF Metadata Discussion

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Group. Please forward to others I've missed.
