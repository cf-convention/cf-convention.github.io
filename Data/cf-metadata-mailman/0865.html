Dear all
<br />
<br />At the CF day in Paris this month there was a discussion of the rules to be
<br />
used to agree changes to the CF conventions. (The standard names are a
<br />
separate process.) I think we all feel that we need a more clearly stated
<br />
procedure to expedite decisions. I presented a proposed set of rules; various
<br />
changes were discussed and appeared to be agreed by those present. Here is
<br />
the current proposal. Please could the members of the conventions committee
<br />
state their view, even if just Yes/No. My vote for this is Yes. :-) All are
<br />
welcome to comment, of course. Once we have a procedure in place, various
<br />
proposals which have already been discussed on this email list will be
<br />
reproposed formally on the new trac system.
<br />
<br />Committee members: Karl Taylor (chair), Kyle Halliday (secretary), Balaji,
<br />
John Caron, Tom Gross, Steve Hankin, Russ Rew, Rich Signell, Jonathan Gregory.
<br />
<br />Thanks. Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br />New proposals to be made on trac using the template, including verbatim changes
<br />
proposed to the text of standard document and the conformance document.
<br />
<br />A member of the conventions committee, or another suitably qualified person,
<br />
volunteers to moderate the discussion. If no-one volunteers, the chairman of
<br />
the committee will ask someone to do it.
<br />
<br />The discussion takes place on trac.
<br />
<br />The moderator periodically summarises discussion on trac, keeps it moving
<br />
forward and tries to achieve a consensus. It is expected that everyone with an
<br />
interest will contribute to the discussion and consensus during this stage.
<br />
<br />After four weeks from the proposal, or two weeks of no contributions,
<br />
whichever is longer, the moderator attempts to wind up the discussion by
<br />
summarising the outcome. The summary should make clear which version of the
<br />
proposal would be adopted, since several may have been discussed. After a
<br />
further two weeks of no contributions, the discussion is concluded and the
<br />
trac ticket closed by the moderator stating the outcome, which should follow
<br />
these rules:
<br />
<br />No outstanding objection     Accept proposal
<br />
Near consensus               Accept proposal if all, or all but one, of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conventions committe vote in favour of it.
<br />
Not near consensus           No change to standard
<br />
<br />(NB These rules are different from the ToRs in the white paper, which allowed
<br />
a simple majority to decide. The discussion in Paris indicated that all
<br />
members should vote, but should be guided by other members where they don't
<br />
consider themselves to have the right expertise.)
<br />
<br />If a change is accepted, the standard document should be updated, the CF
<br />
convention version number incremented, and the conformance document updated.
<br />
<br />The author of the proposal should be added to the list of contributing authors
<br />
of the CF convention.
<br />
<br />At this point, the change is shown in the document as provisional, but it will
<br />
not be revoked unless subsequent testing shows it to be flawed. Provisional
<br />
status lasts until the Unidata cflib and the NCAS CF checker have both
<br />
successfully interpreted some data following the new convention.
<br />
<br />Once this has been done, the document should again be updated to remove the
<br />
provisional status, and the version number incremented again.
<br />
<br />All versions of the standard and conformance document should be kept available
<br />
online, with their trac tickets and a history of changes.
