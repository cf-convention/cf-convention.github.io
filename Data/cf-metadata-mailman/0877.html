<br />
Dear all
<br />
<br />I believe that in Paris there was agreement that we needed to be able to make
<br />
decisions on reasonable timescales. What has often happened is that a good
<br />
discussion has taken place, but with no agreed procedure to make a decision,
<br />
once things go quiet the issue drifts into limbo. We have several such issues
<br />
from the last several years. That was the reason for my making the proposal,
<br />
which I thought we had essentially agreed in Paris, but of course not everyone
<br />
was there.
<br />
<br />Most requests for extension to the conventions come from people who intend to
<br />
write data fairly soon and find that CF lacks a convention for something they
<br />
need. Someone who makes such a proposal might indeed be the only person who
<br />
sees the need for it at that time, but that in itself is not a good reason to
<br />
reject the proposal. There is a first time for everything! What is necessary
<br />
is that other people pay some attention to the matter, and form a view. That
<br />
might not be a lot of people. We discussed in Paris that not everyone feels
<br />
able to participate in all discussions because of expertise. I proposed that
<br />
it was good enough if just the moderator and the proposer had thought about the
<br />
proposal, but I agree it would be safer if we required there to have been one
<br />
other person express a positive view during the discussion. Note that a single
<br />
person posting to express a reservation is sufficient for the moderator to
<br />
have to try to engineer a consensus or arrange a vote if this has not been
<br />
answered (because in that case there is an outstanding objection). That is
<br />
already quite a large safeguard, I would say.
<br />
<br />Is that OK? I don't think it is necessary to have as many as five. Given past
<br />
experience I think few issues would be agreed with such a requirement. For
<br />
instance, on several previous occasions I have appealed for people to express a
<br />
view (positive or negative) on a particular matter under discussion and had no
<br />
response. To solve this kind of problem, greater engagement is needed, not
<br />
tougher rules, I'd say. It is necessary for people who think CF is valuable to
<br />
engage in discussions about it at the time changes are proposed.
<br />
<br />I think the requirement for test data should be included in the requirement for
<br />
testing, rather than at the time of the proposal. Proposals always include
<br />
CDL examples. A real file may find problems once it is given to software as
<br />
input, and obviously it must exist for the testing to take place (so I agree
<br />
we need to require such a file), but it will not help the discussion of the
<br />
proposal.
<br />
<br />The idea was the the libcf and the CF-checker are the two applications which
<br />
are required to verify that the new convention &quot;works&quot;, in the sense that it
<br />
can be successfully interpreted. I think that's a pretty good indication it is
<br />
not flawed and does not break applications. To require two further applications
<br />
to use the data would, I think, be a recipe for no convention ever passing out
<br />
of provisional status on a foreseeable timescale, since those two are the only
<br />
ones which have a stated commitment to support CF. 
<br />
<br />It's a good suggestions that the committee could decide what to do if an
<br />
agreed change fails at the stage of testing. Alternatively, it could be
<br />
referred back to the proposer by default.
<br />
<br />As I often do, I am arguing from the point of view of a data-provider. I see
<br />
the need to design conventions carefully, but if the standard cannot be
<br />
updated on a timescale which matches the needs of people who want to use it to
<br />
write data, it's not a lot of use. They will just invent their own conventions
<br />
and that will frustrate the purpose of CF.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
