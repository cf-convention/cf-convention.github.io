Dear all
<br />
<br />Two points about this question:
<br />
<br />(1) I agree with Ken that CF is concerned with use metadata, but that there
<br />
is overlap between use and discovery metadata. If needs arise for metadata
<br />
that CF does not support at present but which could go in CF, do please
<br />
consider proposing extensions to CF. As you may know, we are at present
<br />
trying to agree definite rules and timescales for making changes to CF, as we
<br />
have not up to now had a clear procedure. I can appreciate that it is more
<br />
effort to propose and argue for an extension or change to CF than it is to
<br />
devise a convention within a smaller community. The discussions that ensue
<br />
can definitely be hard work, but I feel that it is worthwhile and leads to a
<br />
better result, and I think that the applicability of CF should be broadened
<br />
as much as possible. This is because many problems do turn out to be of more
<br />
general application than one might initially suspect.
<br />
<br />(2) Although a syntax could be introduced to indicate in the names of
<br />
attributes which convention defines them (as John suggests), I suspect this
<br />
may be too much of an &quot;easy way out&quot;. This is rather like discussions we have
<br />
had about standard names. So far we have maintained one standard name table
<br />
to serve all disciplines. It is more work to choose these names but it means
<br />
the names have to be clearly defined, and there is only one name for a given
<br />
concept, so it helps data exchange between different user communities. If you
<br />
allow conventions to have separate attribute namespaces, there is less
<br />
incentive to look at other existing conventions to see whether the same issue
<br />
has been addressed by someone else. The result will be the development of
<br />
synonyms and mutual unintelligibility, whereas if attributes have common
<br />
names across conventions, interoperability is promoted. So I think it would
<br />
be good if Unidata maintained a registry of attribute names defined by
<br />
known/registered netCDF conventions. This will assist in different conventions
<br />
sharing attributes, such as we already do with those defined by Unidata like
<br />
_FillValue and Conventions.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
