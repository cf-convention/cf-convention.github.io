<br />
Dear all
<br />
<br />I am pleased to say that we have reached agreement on the rules for making
<br />
changes to the CF conventions. All the members of the conventions committee
<br />
have voted Yes to the rules, in some cases after discussion and revision. It
<br />
has been more than three weeks since any further substantial changes were
<br />
suggested. Thanks to all who contributed to the discussion. Below is the final
<br />
version, which will be put on the CF website. Of course, if it is should turn
<br />
out in coming months that these rules of procedure don't work properly, we
<br />
can revise them. However, I think that with these rules we are now in a much
<br />
better position, because we have decided how to make decisions! This means we
<br />
should be able to tackle several outstanding issues which have been discussed
<br />
on the email list over past months and years, but subsequently drifted into
<br />
limbo because we had no procedure for reaching a conclusion.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br />New proposals are to be made on trac using the template, including verbatim
<br />
changes proposed to the text of standard document and the conformance
<br />
document.
<br />
<br />A member of the conventions committee, or another suitably qualified person,
<br />
volunteers to moderate the discussion. If no-one volunteers, the chairman of
<br />
the committee will ask someone to do it.
<br />
<br />The discussion takes place on trac and all may participate.
<br />
<br />The moderator periodically summarises discussion on trac, keeps it moving
<br />
forward and tries to achieve a consensus. It is expected that everyone with an
<br />
interest will contribute to the discussion and to achieving a consensus during
<br />
this stage. During the discussion, if an objection is raised, answered and not
<br />
reasserted, the moderator will assume the objection has been dropped. However,
<br />
since consensus is the best outcome, it will be helpful if anyone who
<br />
expresses an objection explicitly withdraws it on changing their mind or
<br />
deciding to accept the majority view.
<br />
<br />It will be helpful if a test netCDF file is provided as early as possible
<br />
during the discussion. However, several variants of the proposal may be
<br />
discussed, and the proposer may not be able to provide test netCDF files for
<br />
all of them.
<br />
<br />When three weeks have passed with no contributions being made, the moderator
<br />
should attempt to move toward a decision on the proposal by summarising the
<br />
discussion outcome and indicating the outcome as consensus, near consensus, or
<br />
not near consensus (see below) on making the proposed change. Since several
<br />
versions of the proposal might have been discussed, the summary should make
<br />
clear which one, if any, would be adopted. The moderator will then invite
<br />
further comment on the proposal, as summarised.  If futher comments are made
<br />
i.e. the discussion restarts, this step is repeated.
<br />
<br />Once the summary has been made, if the test netCDF file does not yet exist, it
<br />
must be created (unless the summary suggests the proposal should be rejected).
<br />
When three weeks have passed with no contributions following a summary, and
<br />
providing a test file exists (if appropriate), a decision is reached in one of
<br />
the following ways:
<br />
<br />Consensus: Accept the proposal if there is no outstanding objection, and at
<br />
least three contributors have expressed support for it, including at least two
<br />
members of the conventions committee. If the moderator personally expresses
<br />
support, he or she can be counted among the supporters.
<br />
<br />Near consensus: If the conditions for consensus are not met but the
<br />
moderator's summary is that consensus has nearly been achieved, accept the
<br />
proposal if all, or all but one, of the conventions committee vote in favour
<br />
of it. The moderator will call for votes and all members should vote.
<br />
<br />Not near consensus: No change to standard.
<br />
<br />The trac ticket is then closed by the moderator stating the outcome.
<br />
<br />If the change is accepted, the standard document should be updated, the CF
<br />
convention version number incremented, and the conformance document updated.
<br />
<br />The author of the proposal should be added to the list of contributing authors
<br />
of the CF convention.
<br />
<br />At this point, the change is shown in the CF documents as provisional, but it
<br />
will not be revoked unless subsequent testing shows it to be flawed.  In rare
<br />
circumstances, unforeseen issues may arise during testing that could lead the
<br />
standards committee to decide by unanimous opinion to revoke the provisional
<br />
change.
<br />
<br />Provisional status lasts until at least two applications have successfully
<br />
interpreted the data in the test or some other netCDF file following the new
<br />
convention. The Unidata libcf and the NCAS CF checker would be sufficient to
<br />
meet this requirement. If other applications are to be used, the conventions
<br />
committee must be satisfied that they are suitable.
<br />
<br />Once the testing is successful, the CF documents should again be updated to
<br />
remove the provisional status, and the version number incremented again.  If
<br />
the testing is not successful, the change is revoked.
<br />
<br />All versions of the standard and conformance document should be kept available
<br />
online, with their trac tickets and a history of changes.
