Hi Olivier:
<br />
Just to remind us all (we need to get this agreed if possible  as the
<br />
GHRSST-PP are working on a new set of documentation) and the large EU
<br />
MyOcean project will be using CF as a the baseline for ocean products.
<br />
<br />My comments on your summary mail are in line below. also attached is
<br />
the original proposal. Note that the operational GHRSST-PP community
<br />
is moving some 25Gb SST data in netCDF _each day_ using GHRSST-PP
<br />
definitions and that the World Meteorological Organisation has
<br />
accepted the proposed terms already.
<br />
<br />I hope we can resolve these issues as quickly as possible now.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Craig
<br />
<br /><br />Summary of proposal so Far (from Oliveier Laurent mail)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  *SSTint (GHRSST-PP): surface_temperature (CF)
</em><br />
OK as we do not use this in operations but clarification on the
<br />
interface may still be useful in a description.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  *SSTskin (GHRSST-PP):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  - sea_surface_temperature_in_skin_layer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  - skin_sea_surface_temperature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  - sea_skin_temperature?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  - sea_water_temperature with a depth attribute ?
</em><br />
We still propose skin_layer_sea_surface_temperature as in the
<br />
GHRSST-PP proposal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  *SSTsubskin (GHRSST-PP):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  - sea_surface_temperature_in_subskin_layer?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  - subskin_sea_surface_temperature?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  - sea_subskin_temperature?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  - sea_water_temperature with a depth attribute ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (same comments as for SSTskin)
</em><br />
I accept subskin_sea_surface_temperature
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  *SSTdepth (GHRSST-PP): sea_water_temperature (CF)
</em><br />
<br />I'm happy with Alison and Nan suggestions regarding the use of
<br />
sea_water_temperature followed by a depth attribute.  Without the
<br />
depth attribute the data are only of marginal use in data assimilation
<br />
systems and for blending.  Many of the problems we have in the
<br />
satellite SST community today stem from the fact that depth was not
<br />
included as an essential component of the measurement.  Now that some
<br />
satellite radiometers are providing more accurate and consistent
<br />
measurements of SST than can be obtained in situ (O'Carroll et al
<br />
JTECH, 2007) depth is essential!!)  So to answer Alisons question
<br />
<br />&quot;We already have the standard name sea_water_temperature which is
<br />
defined as follows: &quot;For the temperature of sea water at a particular
<br />
depth or layer, a data variable of sea_water_temperature with a
<br />
vertical coordinate axis should be used.&quot;  Would this meet your
<br />
needs?&quot; The answer is YES it does and we will work on this within
<br />
GHRSST-PP. but The need for the depth information needs to be
<br />
mandatory can this be done?  without depth it is somewhat
<br />
meaningless...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  *SSTfnd (GHRSST-PP):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  - sea_surface_temperature_at_diurnal_thermocline_base
</em><br />
This is not correct.  The main purpose of SSTfnd is to remove from the
<br />
vocabulary of
<br />
scientists the totally confusing and lazy term bulk SST which is
<br />
meaningless in the context of modern measurements, for data
<br />
assimilation and simply perpetuates confusion and erroneous
<br />
assumptions (Bit harsh, I know, but essentially true!)).  To answer
<br />
Alison's question:
<br />
<br />&quot;Does this mean that the foundation temperature is measured/modelled
<br />
at the base of the thermocline so that the values are intrinsically
<br />
free of diurnal variation [YES], or is the diurnal variation
<br />
statistically removed from the data [it could be - especially when
<br />
blending data for statistical analyses]?&quot;  The answer is yes in both
<br />
cases.  I hope that a new 'surface' and associated name can be
<br />
introduced to represent this quantity which is the quantity that most
<br />
global SST analysis systems produce today.  There is a nice figure
<br />
showing what SSTfnd is at
<br />
<a href="https://www.ghrsst-pp.org/SST-Definitions.html">https://www.ghrsst-pp.org/SST-Definitions.html</a>
<br />
So I would argue for foundation_sea_surface_temperature
<br />
<br />Original proposal==========================================
<br />
For the benefit of everyone concerned, here are the full definitions
<br />
(reported in Donlon et al., J Climate 2002 and updated and reported in
<br />
BAMS this August). The following is taken from
<br />
<a href="https://www.ghrsst-pp.org/SST-Definitions.html">https://www.ghrsst-pp.org/SST-Definitions.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br />SST is a difficult parameter to define exactly because the upper ocean
<br />
(~10 m) has a complex and variable vertical temperature structure that
<br />
is related to ocean turbulence and the air-sea fluxes of heat,
<br />
moisture and momentum. A framework is required to understand the
<br />
information content and relationships between measurements of SST made
<br />
by different satellite and in situ instruments, especially if these
<br />
are to be merged together. The definitions of SST developed by the
<br />
GHRSST-PP SST Science Team (agreed at the 2nd and 3rd GHRSST-PP
<br />
workshops) achieve the closest possible coincidence between what is
<br />
defined and what can be measured operationally, bearing in mind
<br />
current scientific knowledge and understanding of how the near surface
<br />
thermal structure of the ocean behaves in nature.
<br />
<br />The interface temperature (SSTint)
<br />
At the exact air-sea interface a hypothetical temperature called the
<br />
interface temperature (SSTint) is defined although this is of no
<br />
practical use because it cannot be measured using current technology.
<br />
(NOTE- this is probably not required but was included for
<br />
completeness)
<br />
[Proposed CF-names: SSTint, interface_SST, interface_sea_surface_temperature]
<br />
<br />The skin sea surface temperature (SSTskin)
<br />
The skin temperature (SSTskin) is defined as the temperature measured
<br />
by an infrared radiometer typically operating at wavelengths 3.7-12 ?m
<br />
(chosen for consistency with the majority of infrared satellite
<br />
measurements) that represents the temperature within the conductive
<br />
diffusion-dominated sub-layer at a depth of ~10-20 ?m. SSTskin
<br />
measurements are subject to a large potential diurnal cycle including
<br />
cool skin layer effects (especially at night under clear skies and low
<br />
wind speed conditions) and warm layer effects in the daytime. (NOTE:
<br />
Discussion on frequency is of secondary importance here - the main
<br />
issue is that the SSTskin is that retrieved using an infrared
<br />
radiometer)
<br />
[Proposed CF-names: SSTskin, skin_layer_SST, skin_layer_sea_surface_temperature]
<br />
<br /><br />The sub-skin sea surface temperature (SSTsub-skin)
<br />
The subskin temperature (SSTsubskin) represents the temperature at the
<br />
base of the conductive laminar sub-layer of the ocean surface. For
<br />
practical purposes, SSTsubskin can be well approximated to the
<br />
measurement of surface temperature by a microwave radiometer operating
<br />
in the 6-11 GHz frequency range, but the relationship is neither
<br />
direct nor invariant to changing physical conditions or to the
<br />
specific geometry of the microwave measurements.  (NOTE: Discussion on
<br />
frequency is of secondary importance here - the main issue is that the
<br />
SSTsub-skin is that retrieved using a microwave radiometer)
<br />
[Proposed CF-names: SSTsubskin, Sub-skin_SST, sub-skin_sea_surface_temperature]
<br />
<br /><br />The surface temperature at depth (SSTz or SSTdepth)
<br />
All measurements of water temperature beneath the SSTsubskin are
<br />
referred to as depth temperatures (SSTdepth) measured using a wide
<br />
variety of platforms and sensors such as drifting buoys, vertical
<br />
profiling floats, or deep thermistor chains at depths ranging from
<br />
10-2 - 103m.  These temperature observations are distinct from those
<br />
obtained using remote sensing techniques (SSTskin and SSTsubskin) and
<br />
must be qualified by a measurement depth in meters (e.g., or SST(z)
<br />
e.g. SST5m).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The foundation temperature (SSTfnd) (Please look at figure provided at
<br />
<a href="https://www.ghrsst-pp.org/SST-Definitions.html">https://www.ghrsst-pp.org/SST-Definitions.html</a> to make sense of this)
<br />
&nbsp;The foundation SST, SSTfnd, is defined as the temperature of the
<br />
water column free of diurnal temperature variability (daytime warming
<br />
or nocturnal cooling) and is considered equivalent to the SSTsubskin
<br />
in the absence of any diurnal signal.  It is named to indicate that it
<br />
is the foundation temperature from which the growth of the diurnal
<br />
thermocline develops each day (noting that on some occasions with a
<br />
deep mixed layer there is no clear SSTfnd profile in the surface
<br />
layer). Only in situ contact thermometry is able to measure SSTfnd and
<br />
analysis procedures must be used to estimate the SSTfnd from
<br />
radiometric satellite measurements of SSTskin and SSTsubskin. SSTfnd
<br />
provides a connection with the historical concept of a &quot;bulk&quot; SST
<br />
considered representative of the oceanic mixed layer temperature and
<br />
represented by any SSTdepth measurement within the upper ocean over a
<br />
depth range of 1-20+m.  SSTfnd provides a more precise, well-defined
<br />
quantity than previous loosely defined &quot;bulk&quot; SST and consequently, a
<br />
better representation of the mixed layer temperature. In general,
<br />
SSTfnd will be similar to a night time minimum or pre-dawn value at
<br />
depths of ~1-5 m, but some differences could exist. Note that SSTfnd
<br />
does not imply a constant depth mixed layer, but rather a surface
<br />
layer of variable depth depending on the balance between
<br />
stratification and turbulent energy and is expected to change slowly
<br />
over the course of a day.
<br />
[Proposed CF-names: SSTfnd, Foundation_Temperature,
<br />
foundation_sea_surface_temperature]
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />I should note that I had a small WMO/IOC JCOMM  task team set up as
<br />
part of the SOT to look at this a year or so ago which concluded at
<br />
this years SOT.  The definitions presented above above were adopted by
<br />
the WMO CBS.  I Hope this makes things clearer and more straight
<br />
forward and I sense that the main concern is with the in situ folk
<br />
regarding the details and not the principles behind SSTz.
