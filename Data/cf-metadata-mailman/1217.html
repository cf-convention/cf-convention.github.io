Dear All,
<br />
<br />The purpose of this posting is to summarize the status so far of all the
<br />
standard names that have been proposed to meet needs of the CCMVal
<br />
project.  A total of 104 names relating to atmospheric chemistry and
<br />
atmospheric dynamics have been proposed.
<br />
<br />Mole Fraction names
<br />
<br />The following names have attracted no discussion and are accepted:
<br />
N.B. Because of the units of mole mole-1 we assign a canonical unit of 1
<br />
(i.e. dimensionless quantity) to mole fractions in the standard name
<br />
table.
<br />
mole_fraction_of_nitrous_oxide_in_air; 1; N2O 
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hydrogen_chloride_in_air; 1; HCl
<br />
mole_fraction_of_methyl_chloride _in_air; 1; CH3Cl
<br />
mole_fraction_of_methyl_bromide_in_air; 1; CH3Br
<br />
mole_fraction_of_carbon_tetrachloride_in_air; 1; CCl4
<br />
mole_fraction_of_atomic_chlorine_in_air; 1; Cl
<br />
mole_fraction_of_chlorine monoxide_in_air; 1; ClO
<br />
mole_fraction_of_dichlorine peroxide_in_air; 1; Cl2O2
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hypochlorous acid_in_air; 1; HOCl
<br />
mole_fraction_of_chlorine_nitrate_in_air; 1; ClONO2
<br />
mole_fraction_of_chlorine dioxide_in_air; 1; OClO
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hydroperoxyl_radical_in_air; 1; HO2
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hydrogen_peroxide_in_air; 1; H2O2
<br />
mole_fraction_of_atomic_nitrogen_in_air; 1; N
<br />
mole_fraction_of_dinitrogen_pentoxide_in_air; 1; N2O5
<br />
mole_fraction_of_peroxynitric_acid_in_air; 1; HNO4
<br />
mole_fraction_of_atomic_bromine_in_air; 1; Br
<br />
mole_fraction_of_bromine_monoxide_in_air; 1; BrO
<br />
mole_fraction_of_bromine_chloride_in_air; 1; BrCl
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hydrogen_bromide_in_air; 1; HBr
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hypobromous_acid_in_air; 1; HOBr
<br />
mole_fraction_of_bromine_nitrate_in_air; 1; BrONO2
<br />
mole_fraction_of_methyl_hydroperoxide_in_air; 1; CH3OOH
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hydrogen_cyanide_in_air; 1; HCN
<br />
mole_fraction_of_passive_ozone_in_air; 1; This is a tracer quantity
<br />
<br />The following mole fraction names have been proposed for cfcs and
<br />
halons:
<br />
mole_fraction_of_cfc11_in_air; 1; CFCl3
<br />
mole_fraction_of_cfc12_in_air; 1; CF2Cl2
<br />
mole_fraction_of_cfc113_in_air; 1; CCl2FCClF2
<br />
mole_fraction_of_cfc113a_in_air; 1; CCl3CF3
<br />
mole_fraction_of_cfc114_in_air; 1; CClF2CClF2
<br />
mole_fraction_of_cfc115_in_air; 1; CClF2CF3
<br />
mole_fraction_of_halon1301_in_air; 1; CBrF3
<br />
mole_fraction_of_halon1211_in_air; 1; CBrClF2
<br />
mole_fraction_of_halon2402_in_air; 1; C2Br2F4
<br />
mole_fraction_of_halon1201_in_air; 1; CBr2F2
<br />
<br />Regarding the chemical names for cfc, hcfc and halon species the
<br />
discussion has centred on whether IUPAC names should always be used.  To
<br />
date, no firm decision has been made to adopt IUPAC nomenclature for all
<br />
CF standard names.  There is a definite (and becoming more urgent) need
<br />
to agree a coherent approach to the way CF will treat chemical species
<br />
names in the future, but that discussion is probably best held
<br />
separately from that of any specific set of proposals.  I will shortly
<br />
create a new ticket in the CF trac system which can be used as a place
<br />
to hold the wider discussion.
<br />
<br />As far as the CCMVal proposals are concerned, apart from the question
<br />
regarding IUPAC nomenclature, no objections have been raised to these
<br />
names.  The terms proposed, e.g. cfc11, are unique so will not give rise
<br />
to ambiguity and they are already widely in use as has been pointed out
<br />
in the discussion. IUPAC equivalences can be given in the explanation of
<br />
the names.  If a decision is made subsequently to use exclusively IUPAC
<br />
(or indeed any other naming system) in CF then aliases would need to be
<br />
created for any non-conforming names.  In the present circumstances, I
<br />
think that the proposed cfc and halon mole_fraction names can be
<br />
accepted for use in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />I would like to ask for further clarification on the meaning of the
<br />
following names:
<br />
mole_fraction_of_inorganic_chlorine_in_air; 1; (Cly) Does this mean
<br />
chlorine contained in inorganic molecules plus atomic chlorine?  Does it
<br />
cover a particular list of species or one that varies from model to
<br />
model?
<br />
mole_fraction_of_total_inorganic_bromine_in_air; 1; (Bry) This raises
<br />
the same questions as the chlorine name
<br />
mole_fraction_of_total_reactive_nitrogen_in_air; 1; (NOy) Again, please
<br />
can you explain this term further.  I am not clear as to what species
<br />
are covered by &quot;reactive nitrogen&quot;.
<br />
mole_fraction_of_anthropogenic_nmvoc_in_air; 1; nmvoc means non-methane
<br />
volatile organic compounds
<br />
mole_fraction_of_biogenic_nmvoc_in_air; 1; 
<br />
NMVOC names have been discussed before when names were proposed for the
<br />
HTAP project.  They have not yet been included in the standard name
<br />
table.  The question again is what species are included in nmvoc.  If
<br />
the species vary from model to model then presumably there needs to be a
<br />
way of recording in the Netcdf file which species were actually included
<br />
in any particular dataset.
<br />
<br />Mole Burden and Tendency of Mole Burden Names
<br />
<br />The proposed mole_burden names are:
<br />
<br />atmosphere_nitrous_oxide_mole_burden; mol;
<br />
atmosphere_cfc11_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_cfc12_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_cfc113_mole_burden; mol;
<br />
atmosphere_cfc114_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_cfc115_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_carbon_tetrachloride_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_halon1301_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_halon1211_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_halon2402_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_halon1202_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_methane_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_carbon_monoxide_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_molecular_hydrogen_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_methyl_chloride_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_methyl_bromide_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_hcc140a_mole_burden; mol; 
<br />
atmosphere_hcfc22_mole_burden; mol;
<br />
<br />where atmosphere_X_mole_burden means the total number of moles of X in
<br />
the atmosphere.
<br />
<br /><br />Following on from the mole_burden names the following tendency names are
<br />
also proposed:
<br />
<br />tendency_of_nitrous_oxide_mole_burden; mol s-1;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_cfc11_mole_burden; mol s-1;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_cfc12_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_cfc113_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_cfc114_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_cfc115_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_carbon_tetrachloride_mole_burden; mol s-1;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_halon1301_mole_burde; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_halon1211_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_halon2402_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_halon1202_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_methane_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_troposphere_methane_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_middle_atmosphere_methane_mole_burden; mol s-1;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_carbon_monoxide_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_troposphere_carbon_monoxide_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_middle_atmosphere_carbon_monoxide_in_air; mol s-1;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_molecular_hydrogen_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_troposphere_molecular_hydrogen_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_middle_atmosphere_molecular_hydrogen_in_air; mol s-1;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_methyl_chloride_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_troposphere_methyl_chloride_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_middle_atmosphere_methyl_chloride_in_air; mol s-1;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_methyl_bromide_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_troposphere_methyl_bromide_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_middle_atmosphere_methyl_bromide_mole_burden; mol s-1;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_hcc140a_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_troposphere_hcc140a_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_middle_atmosphere_hcc140a_mole_burden; mol s-1; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_hcfc22_mole_burden; mol s-1;
<br />
tendency_of_troposphere_hcfc22_mole_burden; mol s-1;
<br />
<br />Firstly, the chemical species names are the same as those for the
<br />
mole_fraction proposals which have been accepted.
<br />
<br />Secondly, if the term &quot;mole_burden&quot; is accepted for use, then the
<br />
construction of the tendency names follows directly and both these sets
<br />
of names could be accepted together.
<br />
<br />This brings me to the outstanding question regarding all these names,
<br />
which is the adoption of the &quot;burden&quot; term itself.  This has given rise
<br />
to a considerable amount of debate on the mailing list and at present
<br />
opinion is divided.
<br />
<br />There was some discussion of an alternative to using &quot;burden&quot;  by
<br />
describing the quantities as area integrals:
<br />
area_integral_of_atmosphere_X_mole_content with use of cell_methods to
<br />
express the fact that area is the entire globe.  However, it was
<br />
generally agreed that this is not the way to proceed.  The remaining
<br />
'for' and 'against' arguments can be summarised as follows:
<br />
<br />'For' the adoption of &quot;burden&quot;:
<br />
<br />* &quot;Burden&quot; is used and defined in the IPCC AR4 report which is intended
<br />
to be read by both experts and non-experts.  It is therefore widely
<br />
understood and its use in standard names will aid those searching for
<br />
the data.
<br />
<br />* It allows names to be constructed with a parallel syntax to existing
<br />
&quot;content&quot; names.  &quot;Content&quot; had to be defined as a per unit area
<br />
quantity for use in CF and &quot;burden&quot; could also have a clearly defined
<br />
meaning that is consistent for all CF standard names.  The CF definition
<br />
of burden would be the total amount of substance contained in the full
<br />
depth of the atmosphere and over the entire globe.
<br />
<br />'Against' the adoption of &quot;burden&quot;:
<br />
<br />* &quot;Burden&quot; is also sometimes used to mean the column integral of an
<br />
amount, e.g., column mass, and its use to mean a global integral could
<br />
therefore lead to confusion.
<br />
<br />* An alternative syntax has been proposed: &quot;moles_of_X_in_atmosphere&quot;
<br />
where X is the name of the chemical species.  This syntax is as concise
<br />
as the proposed &quot;burden&quot; syntax and avoids the need to define any new
<br />
terminology in standard names.
<br />
<br />N.B. If the alternative suggestion is adopted the tendency names would
<br />
then need to be modified to have the syntax:
<br />
tendency_of_moles_of_X_in_atmosphere.
<br />
<br />The various viewpoints have been discussed at some length and no new
<br />
points have been raised on the mailing list in recent days.  However, we
<br />
have not yet arrived at a consensus view.  Among those expressing a
<br />
view, opinion is currently divided along the following lines:
<br />
<br />In favour of adopting &quot;burden&quot;: Martin, Veronika
<br />
Against adopting &quot;burden&quot;: Christiane, Karl
<br />
Willing to accept majority decision (but tending to lean against
<br />
adopting &quot;burden&quot;: Jonathan, Philip
<br />
<br />I have sought here to represent the current situation as fairly as
<br />
possible.  If I have unfairly represented anyone's views I trust that
<br />
you will correct me.
<br />
<br />My own view (which is just one vote, like all the others) is against the
<br />
adoption of &quot;burden&quot; because of the possibility of confusion with column
<br />
integrals.  Personally, I think that avoiding ambiguity is one of the
<br />
most important considerations when constructing new standard names.  If
<br />
a term is widely used in the literature with two distinct meanings I
<br />
think that confusion will inevitably arise.
<br />
<br />Taking all the above points into consideration, I think the weight of
<br />
opinion is currently against adopting &quot;burden&quot; as a term in standard
<br />
names.  However, Veronika and Martin have given reasoned arguments as to
<br />
why the term should be adopted.  In order to make further progress on
<br />
this issue within a reasonable timescale I would like first to put a
<br />
question to Martin and Veronika: would you be willing to accept the
<br />
majority view and adopt the &quot;moles_of_X_in_atmosphere&quot; syntax for
<br />
standard names?  Within CCMVal you would of course still be free to
<br />
agree the use of a long_name attribute using &quot;burden&quot;.  If you feel that
<br />
this is an acceptable solution, the names could be agreed immediately
<br />
and included in the next update to the standard name table.  If,
<br />
however, your preference is still to use &quot;burden&quot; in the standard names,
<br />
I think the sensible course of action now would be to call on the
<br />
members of the standard names committee to comment and reach a decision
<br />
on whether to adopt the term.  Please note that the committee's decision
<br />
would be final.
<br />
<br /><br />Dynamical Names
<br />
<br />The following name is already in the standard name table:
<br />
tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_gravity_wave_drag; m s-2;
<br />
I think it is worth expanding the explanation to point out the
<br />
relationship between this name and the names proposed for the components
<br />
that contribute to the overall gravity wave drag.
<br />
<br />The following names have attracted no discussion and are accepted:
<br />
<br />northward_heat_flux_due_to_eddy_advection; W m-2;
<br />
<br />northward_eliassen_palm_flux; m3 s-2;  &quot;Eliassen Palm flux&quot; is a widely
<br />
used vector in the meridional plane, and the divergence of this flux
<br />
appears as a forcing in the Transformed Eulerian mean formulation of the
<br />
zonal mean zonal wind equation.
<br />
<br />upward_eliassen_palm_flux; m3 s-2; 
<br />
<br />tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_eliassen_palm_flux_divergence; m s-2;
<br />
&quot;Eliassen Palm flux&quot; is a widely used vector in the meridional plane,
<br />
and the divergence of this flux appears as a forcing in the Transformed
<br />
Eulerian mean formulation of the zonal mean zonal wind equation. Thus,
<br />
&quot;eastward_wind&quot; here will generally be the zonally averaged eastward
<br />
wind.
<br />
<br />northward_transformed_eulerian_mean_velocity; m s-1;
<br />
eastward_transformed_eulerian_mean_velocity ; m s-1;
<br />
<br />tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_orographic_gravity_wave_drag; m s-2;
<br />
Component of gravity wave drag due to orographic waves.
<br />
<br />tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_nonorographic_gravity_wave_drag; m s-2;
<br />
Component of gravity wave drag due to non-orographic gravity waves.
<br />
<br />upward_flux_of_eastward_momentum_due_to_orographic_gravity_waves; Pa;
<br />
Zonal orographic gravity wave stress (momentum flux).
<br />
<br />upward_flux_of_eastward_momentum_due_to_nonorographic_eastward_gravity_w
<br />
aves; Pa;
<br />
eastward_momentum indicates the component of the momentum which is being
<br />
transported, eastward_gravity_waves indicates the class of gravity waves
<br />
included, with eastward referring to the phase speed of the waves. There
<br />
is thus no obvious redundancy here, though there is a tendency in the
<br />
specialist community to do away with one &quot;eastward&quot; when referring to
<br />
this quantity, since gravity waves with eastward phase speeds only carry
<br />
eastward momentum.
<br />
<br />upward_flux_of_eastward_momentum_due_to_nonorographic_westward_gravity_w
<br />
aves; Pa;
<br />
<br />tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_numerical_artefacts; m s-2; The actual
<br />
tendency of the eastward wind will include a variety of numerical and
<br />
diffusive effects: this variable is designed to allow the momentum
<br />
budget to be closed.
<br />
<br />dynamic_tropopause_potential_temperature; K; The dynamical tropopause is
<br />
very useful for interpreting the dynamics of the upper troposphere and
<br />
lower stratosphere.  As with regions in the previous section, it will be
<br />
useful to have a description of the dynamical tropopause definition, as
<br />
there are variations in the scientific literature. We would propose to
<br />
give the variable an attribute &quot;surface&quot; containing the name of a global
<br />
attribute which describes the surface used.
<br />
<br />The following name has not received much discussion since the proposals
<br />
were posted to the list:
<br />
mean_age_of_stratospheric_air or age_of_stratospheric_air. 
<br />
<br />However, this name did prompt quite a lot of debate in an email exchange
<br />
that took place while the proposals were under development.  The first
<br />
option, mean_age_of_stratospheric_air, is the one preferred by the
<br />
CCMVal community.  My understanding is that the term is widely used in
<br />
the stratospheric literature to mean the time since an air parcel was
<br />
last in contact with the troposphere, and so it is not the same as a
<br />
residence time.  The inclusion of the word &quot;mean&quot; in a standard name
<br />
would not generally be acceptable because &quot;mean&quot; is a term that would
<br />
normally be used as a cell_method to describe statistical processing
<br />
within cell boundaries.  However, my understanding is that in this
<br />
instance, the word &quot;mean&quot; does not imply that any averaging has taken
<br />
place within the cell bounds - rather it refers to the mean time taken
<br />
for air parcels to reach their current location by various transport
<br />
mechanisms from their &quot;source&quot; region.  The term &quot;age of air&quot; is
<br />
generally used in the stratospheric literature to refer to the overall
<br />
distribution of transport times for air parcels reaching a particular
<br />
location.  I hope that someone will correct me if I have misunderstood.
<br />
<br />I have given this name a lot of thought, and while I appreciate that
<br />
&quot;mean&quot; is not being used in the same sense as in cell_methods I confess
<br />
to feeling uncomfortable about including it in the standard name.  I am
<br />
concerned that it may set a precedent for allowing other &quot;non-standard&quot;
<br />
ways of using statistical terms into the standard names.  A possible
<br />
solution might be to have some way of defining a time axis as &quot;time
<br />
since contact with source region&quot; so that we could then use
<br />
&quot;cell_methods: mean&quot; along that axis and a standard name of
<br />
&quot;age_of_air&quot;.  However, I think that this would need a modification to
<br />
the conventions to allow a new type of time axis and I wonder if that is
<br />
just adding extra complication for the sake of one standard name.  I
<br />
would welcome further views on this particular name.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
