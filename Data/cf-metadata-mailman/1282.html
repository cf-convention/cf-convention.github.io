<br />
Dear Craig and all those who have contributed to this thread,
<br />
<br />Thank you to all of you for your many valuable contributions during this
<br />
discussion.
<br />
<br />I have reviewed the whole SST thread from the beginning and it is clear
<br />
that there is widespread support for the GHRSST definitions and the need
<br />
to describe each of them individually with a CF standard name.
<br />
<br />I would like to clarify one procedural point arising from Craig's last
<br />
posting, which is that I do not, in fact, have a casting vote.  My role
<br />
is to follow all the standard names discussions, suggest possible
<br />
clarifications to proposed names and/or definitions and to moderate the
<br />
mailing list discussions with the aim of achieving consensus.  Any
<br />
decision that is reached regarding any of the standard names must be
<br />
firmly based on the points raised during the mailing list discussion.
<br />
<br />Moving now to the details of the standard names, the following gives the
<br />
current status of each of the proposals.
<br />
<br />1. GHRSST name SSTdepth
<br />
<br />There is unanimous agreement to use the existing CF standard name
<br />
sea_water_temperature accompanied by a scalar vertical coordinate
<br />
variable to record the depth.
<br />
<br />2. GHRSST names skin_layer_sea_surface_temperature and
<br />
sub_skin_sea_surface_temperature
<br />
<br />There is widespread support for the CF standard names to include
<br />
explicitly the words &quot;skin&quot; and &quot;subskin&quot;.  Jonathan has suggested the
<br />
wording sea_skin_temperature and sea_subskin_temperature on the grounds
<br />
that &quot;skin&quot; and &quot;subskin&quot; are not, strictly speaking, the same concept
<br />
as &quot;surface&quot;.  Olivier has supported Jonathan's suggestion and Craig has
<br />
indicated that he is content to accept this approach. There have been no
<br />
objections to this suggestion.  Thus, sea_skin_temperature and
<br />
sea_subskin_temperature are accepted as new standard names.  They will
<br />
be included in the table update scheduled for May.
<br />
<br />If the need arises to state precisely the wavelength at which
<br />
sea_skin_temperature or sea_subskin_temperature were measured, a scalar
<br />
coordinate variable with the standard name radiation_wavelength could be
<br />
supplied as additional metadata.
<br />
<br />3. GHRSST name interface_sea_surface_temperature
<br />
<br />I suggested that the existing standard name surface_temperature could be
<br />
used for this quantity.  This suggestion has received support from
<br />
Olivier and qualified support from Roy.  Craig has indicated that he
<br />
finds this solution acceptable.
<br />
<br />After some further consideration I think that the definition of the
<br />
existing name should be modified slightly.  The definition currently
<br />
reads:
<br />
&quot;The surface called 'surface' means the lower boundary of the
<br />
atmosphere. The surface temperature is the (skin) temperature at the
<br />
interface, not the bulk temperature of the medium above or below.&quot;
<br />
I suggest that the parenthesised word &quot;skin&quot; be deleted to avoid any
<br />
potential confusion with the new name 'sea_skin_temperature'.  In all
<br />
other respects I think that the existing definition matches the GHRSST
<br />
definition supplied by Craig:
<br />
&quot;At the exact air-sea interface a hypothetical temperature called the
<br />
interface temperature (SSTint) is defined although this is of no
<br />
practical use because it cannot be measured using current technology.&quot;
<br />
I don't think that deleting &quot;skin&quot; from the definition will affect the
<br />
meaning of surface_temperature as used in coupled models, where it is
<br />
the temperature that is seen by physics parametrizations such as the
<br />
longwave radiation.
<br />
<br />4.  GHRSST name SSTfnd (foundation temperature)
<br />
<br />The only issue remaining to be resolved is the precise wording of the
<br />
name.  There are currently two options on the table:
<br />
sea_surface_temperature_at_diurnal_thermocline_base and
<br />
sea_foundation_temperature.
<br />
<br />I suggested the former as a way of trying to encapsulate the meaning of
<br />
the name using widely understood terminology.  Jonathan has supported
<br />
the suggestion.  Craig has raised the point that foundation_temperature
<br />
has been widely adopted within the data assimilation community and is in
<br />
daily use.
<br />
<br />I have changed my mind about this name and actually I now prefer
<br />
sea_foundation_temperature over my original suggestion.  Given that we
<br />
have achieved consensus for sea_skin_temperature and
<br />
sea_subskin_temperature I think that sea_foundation_temperature provides
<br />
a concise and consistent syntax.  Additionally, the argument that &quot;skin&quot;
<br />
and &quot;subskin&quot; are not the same as the physical sea surface could equally
<br />
well be applied to &quot;foundation&quot;/&quot;base_of_diurnal_thermocline&quot; so it
<br />
would seem inconsistent to refer to this quantity as a
<br />
&quot;sea_surface_temperature&quot;.  It is true that &quot;foundation&quot; is a new term
<br />
to standard names, but actually so are &quot;skin&quot; and &quot;subskin&quot; so, all
<br />
things considered, I can't see any reason to treat this name
<br />
differently.  Last, but not least, sea_foundation_temperature has the
<br />
advantage of using a term that is well recognized in the GHRSST
<br />
community.  Jonathan, do you think this sounds reasonable?
<br />
<br />One general comment: in his posting
<br />
<a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2008/002066.html">http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2008/002066.html</a>, Craig
<br />
raised the issue of CF long_names.  The long_names are not standardised
<br />
in any way, so this attribute can be used to include any alternative
<br />
name that is meaningful to the GHRSST community.  For example, the CF
<br />
long name could contain the GHRSST &quot;shorthand&quot; names such as 'SSTdepth',
<br />
'SSTint', etc., if that would be a useful thing to do.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
