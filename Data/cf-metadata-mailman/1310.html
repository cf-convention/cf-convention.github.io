Dear Bryan and Jonathan,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanks for your answers. While I fully appreciate your reluctance to
<br />
add &quot;external&quot; namespaces to the standard CF file (I would probably react
<br />
similar if such a proposal was put forward to me), I still believe there is
<br />
something missing in the concept and/or work flow to really simplify life
<br />
and establish the standard_names as a true community standard which can be
<br />
put to use. The concept by John Graybeal doesn't help, because you still
<br />
need to manually establish the connection between variable names and
<br />
standard names, and this must be redone whenever the CF file changes (John
<br />
told me that perhaps in the future this could be facilitated in that
<br />
&quot;updates&quot; may become possible, but at present you have to go through the
<br />
whole link process again when a new CF table is released). That concept is
<br />
great for step 2, i.e. if you have different connections (in this case
<br />
different set of variable names), you can establish relationships between
<br />
these. But what I am worried about now is step 1. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not that I shy away from editing the XML file and adding the
<br />
variable names for the project use once. But I can almost guarantee that
<br />
this will then be cast in stone and we will never update to any newer CF
<br />
table (and worse even, over time different groups may generate different
<br />
versions of such a merged table). In contrast, if these tags were contained
<br />
in the default file, it would be easier to follow any new developments. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think we are talking about a large number of sets of &quot;common
<br />
variable names&quot; here: there may be amip (which I believe is still widely in
<br />
use; ECHAM for example uses those in all its netcdf output), there would be
<br />
htap and aerocom for chemistry (and I am optimistic that we can persuade
<br />
other projects to adopt those for atmospheric chemistry, for example in
<br />
upcoming IPCC AR5 simulations), and there may be 2 or 3 others for
<br />
climate/meteorology and ocean (and if there are more they can't be called a
<br />
standard set and thus shouldn't be included). A strong criterion should be
<br />
that these variable names are adopted in large international programmes
<br />
where a good fraction of the respective community is engaged in.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is great to see the great involvement that you all put into this and
<br />
I thank you for this effort. Some of the discussions on the list have become
<br />
almost philosophical and I sure have learnt quite a bit through them. Yet,
<br />
from the pure practical angle I can't see yet, how the standard names can
<br />
become well established if we don't facilitate the connection to &quot;real life&quot;
<br />
name spaces (and at least from my programming experience these are typically
<br />
variable names). It's well possible that I am too old-fashioned in my
<br />
programming paradigm, but then I see myself more as a scientist than a
<br />
software developer, and I know that (at least in the atmospheric chemistry
<br />
field) the same is true for almost anyone who is a potential &quot;customer&quot; of
<br />
standard names. Again, it's step 1 that I am concerned about, which is to
<br />
ease the process of creating files that have these standard names in them.
<br />
Once this is sufficiently spread, the time for the great universal analysis
<br />
tools can come, and these tools would have the chance to identify variables
<br />
by their standard_name alone. Caveat: we are using CMOR in HTAP and this
<br />
helps a lot, but (and I don't hink this is such an exceptional situation)
<br />
when we were producing our first output files, the chemistry names were
<br />
still under discussion, which means we are now using slightly different
<br />
&quot;standard_names&quot; which I don't like at all. The standard_name &lt;--&gt; variable
<br />
mapping which I propose would greatly help to clean this up (and to bring
<br />
additional output which was not or could not be generated through CMOR; for
<br />
example vertical column output; up to the standard as well). 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all this, I would like to emphasize that this is of course a
<br />
personaly biased view and may be too determined by the moment's needs.
<br />
However, I hope you agree with me that this problem shows that something is
<br />
still missing in the concept and that some effort should be made to ease the
<br />
spreading of CF standard names.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Martin
<br />
<br />PS: what I meant by &quot;syntax definition file&quot; came up when I used IDL's
<br />
IDLffxmlSAX parser to scan the contents of the cf-standard-names.xml file.
<br />
The message was:
<br />
% IDLFFXMLSAX::PARSEFILE: Parser SAX warning: File: , line: 0, column: 0 :
<br />

Subject: Re: [CF-metadata] what standard names are for
<br />
<br />Hi Martin
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    although the subject has been changed I feel that this discussion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been closely related to my recent question about adding extra tags 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the XML file and mdefining a way how these can survive. To ask 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again much more specifically this time:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) who is maintaining the xml file (and the asociated syntax 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definiiton file which I could not locate on the web)?
</em><br />
<br />We (BADC) and specificaly Alison Pamment maintain the CF standard names. We
<br />
maintain the authorative version at cfconventions.org, and the
<br />
non-authorative (but version controlled) list via vocab.ndg.nerc.ac.uk.
<br />
<br />There is no associated syntax definition file, if I have understood what you
<br />
mean by that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) if I would send an edited XML file which included &lt;htap&gt; tags to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain the TFHTAP multi-model assessment variable names (just like it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the case for &lt;amip&gt; at present) to the person named in (1): would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this xml file be further maintained and future updates would keep this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; additional tag?
</em><br />
<br />I don't think we're currently in the business of maintaining other folks
<br />
namespaces. and particularly not by locking into any specific xml syntax. I
<br />
think the earlier response to your message from John Graybeal is a better
<br />
way forward for you ...
<br />
<br />That said, the cf common concept (a current proposal thread) could also
<br />
provide a useful mechanism which we (CF) could maintain. However, that
<br />
doesn't exist now!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    If these two points can be satisfied, it would constitute a great 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step forward for me to actually make use of the cf standard names and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other standards around it. And I believe that this will also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proliferate into many other international (atmospheric chemistry) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modelling initiatives, because many groups are involved in HTAP. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not, then I fear that the HTAP community for example will quickly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loose interest to follow standard names as there will for a long time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be no &quot;super software&quot; that eliminates the need to know the actual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable names in order to process the data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry for being somewhat pushy on this, but I need to get some work 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done here.
</em><br />
<br />As do we all :-)
<br />
<br />best wishes,
<br />
Bryan

<br />
<br />Dear Martin   (just to you)
<br />
<br />I'm not quite sure what you mean - sorry. Are you asking about extra tags in
<br />
the standard_name.xml file? This file is maintained by Alison Pamment and
<br />
Velimir Mlaker and its syntax is described in Appendix B of the CF standard.
<br />
However, personally I don't think we should add more tags in that centrally
<br />
maintained file. I actually would prefer that we removed the PCMDI and GRIB
<br />
info, which is out of date. Would it not be better for separate files to be
<br />
maintained by PCMDI, HTAP and others, giving the CF equivalences of their
<br />
codes?
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
