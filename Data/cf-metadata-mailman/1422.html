Dear Jon
<br />
<br />I am sorry you are frustrated. I sympathise with your frustrations. We should
<br />
indeed make the website clearer about the instructions.
<br />
<br />Your bottom line is correct:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This all comes down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a lack of time on everybody's part.  Is it not time to consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applying for funds to employ more people to be dedicated to CF?  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have thought that the community would strongly support this.
</em><br />
<br />We (the conventions committee and a few others) are pursuing this. I think it
<br />
is essential for the future development of CF that we employ people whose job
<br />
is to work on it. I agree that it should be obvious, but in practice, who in
<br />
&quot;the community&quot; will pay for it? A great many organisations benefit from what
<br />
has been done voluntarily to define CF, but very few of them are likely to be
<br />
eager to support it. They would want to know why it is their responsibility in
<br />
particular to do so, and not someone else's. How would you make a case to NCEO
<br />
or the Met Office, for instance, that they should fund a member of staff to
<br />
work on CF for the benefit of the world?
<br />
<br />A change cannot be agreed without detailed text being proposed, because there
<br />
is no-one who has time to work out the detailed text in response to a proposal.
<br />
The original document authors you refer to, such as me, are not employed to
<br />
work on CF, any more than you are. We all have other full-time jobs. There are
<br />
no &quot;developers&quot; behind the scenes to do it for us. It does indeed take hours of
<br />
our time. Many other people have likewise contributed hours of their time to
<br />
developing proposals on trac and the email list. Of course, we all recognise
<br />
that it is a severe problem that none of us has enough time for it.
<br />
<br />There is another reason, though, I think, which is that the devil is often in
<br />
the detail. Once something has been agreed in principle, agreeing exactly how
<br />
to do it still requires discussion. Even if we did have people to work on it,
<br />
I think the details would still be debated and decided in public.
<br />
<br />Your participation is of course welcome. I do hope you will stick it out!
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
