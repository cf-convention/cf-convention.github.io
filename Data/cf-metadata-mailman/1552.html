Dear All
<br />
<br />I volunteered to act as the moderator for trac ticket 24, the proposal
<br />
for the common_concept.  This ticket has attracted a lot of interest and
<br />
I added my summary of the current status of the discussion to the trac
<br />
system on 13th August.  Unfortunately, due to an intermittent problem
<br />
with email, my changes were not sent to the cf-conventions mailing list
<br />
and as a result many people are probably unaware that the summary has
<br />
been added.   For convenience, I have included the text of the summary
<br />
below.  If you wish to make any further comments in the discussion,
<br />
please do not reply to this posting but add them to the trac ticket in
<br />
the usual way.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
<br />
<br />==&gt; Please note new email address: alison.pamment at stfc.ac.uk &lt;==
<br />
<br />--- Reproduced from trac ticket #24 ---
<br />
<br />As moderator of this ticket I would first like to thank everyone for the
<br />
many excellent and thoughtful contributions to the discussion.  Clearly
<br />
this proposal has excited a lot of interest.  Thanks in particular to to
<br />
Bryan, John Graybeal and Steve for summarizing at intervals and
<br />
providing suggestions on how to proceed with the discussion.
<br />
<br />I would like first to express my own opinion before moving on to my
<br />
summary of the ticket.  From my point of view, an important strength of
<br />
this proposal is that it could help to speed up the agreement of
<br />
standard names.  I'm not really convinced that it will reduce the number
<br />
of standard name proposals because a common_concept will still require a
<br />
standard_name to point to when describing a physical quantity.  However,
<br />
if a scientific community is able to make use of its own familiar terms
<br />
via the common_concept I think that will tend to reduce the tension
<br />
between the community's wish/requirement to have their particular terms
<br />
accepted as standard and the need for standard_names to be constructed
<br />
according to CF's accepted rules and guidelines.  That is my reason for
<br />
supporting this proposal.
<br />
<br />I will turn now to the role of moderator and try to give as unbiased a
<br />
summary as possible of the discussion so far.  I have tried to
<br />
concentrate on the main areas of agreement and disagreement while
<br />
attempting not to restate too much of the detailed technical arguments.
<br />
<br />1. There is agreement that common_concepts may be used to:-
<br />
a) draw together a combination of CF attributes, to include standard
<br />
name and other attributes such as cell_methods, valid values and/or
<br />
valid ranges of coordinate variables and names of grid mappings.  (This
<br />
list is indicative and not necessarily exhaustive);
<br />
b) provide synonyms for the standard name attribute alone.
<br />
<br />2. All but one contributor seem to be agreed that a CF &quot;concept
<br />
registry&quot; should be established within which user communities can
<br />
register their own common_concepts.  Steve Hankin has raised the concern
<br />
that registering URIs could lead to namespace collisions.
<br />
<br />3. There is agreement on the following potential benefit:-
<br />
The introduction of common_concepts will allow mappings to be created
<br />
between CF and an unlimited number of other vocabularies, whether they
<br />
be local to a single institution or widely adopted in other metadata
<br />
standards.
<br />
This will address the following use cases:-
<br />
a) the requirement for data centres to serve files that contain a user's
<br />
own familiar vocabulary;
<br />
b) the requirement for short names as an alternative to standard_names +
<br />
additional metadata;
<br />
(N.B. this should not be taken to imply that all are agreed on _how_ the
<br />
mapping should be achieved in practice - see later)
<br />
<br />4. Other potential benefits and topics that have emerged during the
<br />
discussion:-
<br />
a) The possibility of registering a concept even while some of its
<br />
constituent parts are under discussion but have not been fully agreed
<br />
within CF, for example, while the standard name is still under
<br />
discussion.  This would require some form of registration system that
<br />
would cater for newer versions of common_concepts.  This would require a
<br />
proposal to be put forward under another trac ticket.
<br />
b) Common_concept may provide a mechanism for CF metadata to reference
<br />
terms from other vocabularies/metadata standards.  In particular, this
<br />
would require the development of a syntax or &quot;parsing scheme&quot; for
<br />
referencing metadata outside the CF standard.  Benno has opened ticket
<br />
#27 for the discussion of this topic.  The form of the URIs used for
<br />
external referencing could also be adopted for referencing
<br />
common_concept bundles of CF attributes.
<br />
c) Bryan has raised the question of how the local names that map onto
<br />
the common_concept URIs should be encoded.  This is an important
<br />
subtopic for the discussion of the current ticket and should be opened
<br />
under another trac ticket.
<br />
d) John Caron, in discussing the content of the common_concept attribute
<br />
raised the question of mapping not just identities, but other types of
<br />
relationships between common concepts and local names.  I think this
<br />
point is very much akin to Steve Hankin's identification of the need to
<br />
&quot;add semantic richness&quot; to standard names, for example, describe the
<br />
relationship between sea_surface_temperature and
<br />
sea_surface_skin_temperature.
<br />
<br /><br />It should be noted that none of these was part of the original proposal
<br />
and in order to keep this discussion to manageable proportions these
<br />
topics should be pursued under separate trac tickets or mailing list
<br />
discussion threads as appropriate.
<br />
<br />5. This ticket should continue to be used for the discussion of the
<br />
original proposal which concentrates on defining common_concepts based
<br />
on metadata attributes that already form part of the CF conventions.
<br />
Even this narrower view gives rise to a number of questions that need to
<br />
be addressed before a second draft of the proposal can be prepared.
<br />
<br />a) What language should be used to describe the definition?
<br />
It is clear that, if a common_concept is to be defined, there must
<br />
necessarily be a way of describing that concept.  The original proposal
<br />
attempts to use CDL as a language for describing the constraints on a
<br />
common concept, i.e., what values its constituent attributes may be
<br />
permitted to take.  It has been demonstrated during the discussion of
<br />
this ticket that CDL does not currently lend itself to this use.  Some
<br />
of the examples in the original proposal are ambiguous in their
<br />
interpretation.  Ticket 29 has been opened for the discussion of the
<br />
technical aspects of using CDL to describe the common_concept.  Other
<br />
possible methods of describing a common_concept have been raised during
<br />
the discussion of this ticket.  These include OWL/XML, RDF and OCL.  The
<br />
resolution of this issue is clearly essential if a second draft of the
<br />
common_concept proposal is to be developed and I would encourage all
<br />
interested parties to contribute to the discussion under ticket 29.
<br />
<br />b) What will be the procedure for registering a common concept
<br />
definition?
<br />
There is some question as to whether the registration of a
<br />
common_concept should be an entirely automated process or whether it
<br />
would/should require some manual intervention.  I would note that,
<br />
although the actual procedure for registering a common_concept may not
<br />
need to be included in the CF conventions (in the same way that the
<br />
procedure for proposing a new standard name is not spelt out within the
<br />
document itself), we nevertheless need to agree the procedure and put
<br />
any necessary software/services in place before the common_concept can
<br />
be put to practical use.  I think that a second draft of the proposal
<br />
would need to contain some further clarification of the registration
<br />
process.
<br />
<br />c) What CF metadata attributes are allowed to be included in the
<br />
common_concept definition?
<br />
This hasn't really come out in the discussion, but I think that for the
<br />
purpose of clearly defining the common_concept within the CF conventions
<br />
it may be necessary to list those attributes that can be used as part of
<br />
a combination.  Does it make sense to allow the use of any attribute or
<br />
are there some that should be excluded from use in common_concepts?
<br />
<br />6) There needs to be a means of attaching the information represented by
<br />
a common_concept to a CF variable.  The original proposal is that this
<br />
will be achieved by introducing a single additional attribute, called
<br />
common_concept, whose value will take the form
<br />
namespace:scoped_name;URI.  The value that this attribute should take,
<br />
and indeed whether a single attribute can suffice, has proved to be the
<br />
point of greatest debate within this discussion.
<br />
<br />To recap, the intended purpose of each of the proposed components of the
<br />
common_concept attribute is as follows:
<br />
scoped_name - this is the name that is used within a scientific
<br />
community to refer to a data variable such as 2 metre temperature;  
<br />
namespace - in essence, identifies the community or institution that
<br />
registered the scoped name;
<br />
URI - a machine readable identifier for the registered definition of the
<br />
common_concept.  All namespace:scoped_name identifiers that reference
<br />
the same common_concept would be associated with the same unique and
<br />
unchanging URI.
<br />
<br />The proposed design incorporates two distinct elements:
<br />
i) The local name that is familiar to the scientist using the data
<br />
ii) The means of mapping that local name to the registered
<br />
common_concept and, by implication, to other synonymous local names.
<br />
<br />a) The use of URIs.
<br />
We are agreed that any URIs should be opaque, i.e., contain no semantic
<br />
information additional to the CF attributes of the common_concept to
<br />
which the URI points.  There is no clear preference for the use of URNs
<br />
or URLs - John Graybeal has suggested that both might be included.
<br />
Ticket #27 includes much discussion of the form that URIs should take
<br />
and the outcome of that ticket should be used to inform the second draft
<br />
of the common_concept proposal.
<br />
<br />b) The local name vs the URI.
<br />
The original proposal was to include both these elements in the
<br />
common_concept attribute.  However, a number of contributors have
<br />
questioned this point:
<br />
John Caron suggested including the local name only - he was concerned
<br />
that a fixed URI would unduly limit possible mappings between
<br />
vocabularies (see below);
<br />
Steve Hankin also suggests using the local name only and does not
<br />
support the registration of URIs within CF;
<br />
Jonathan has suggested including the common_concept URI only - he has
<br />
argued that external software should translate the URI to a local name;
<br />
On behalf of the proposers Frank and Bryan have continued to argue that
<br />
both elements should be included so that the URI can point to the bundle
<br />
of attributes forming the concept while the inclusion of local names is
<br />
convenient for scientists accessing data from within a particular
<br />
institution.
<br />
<br />Frank has further suggested that the two elements could be split between
<br />
two new attributes - common_concept_urn and common_concept_local.
<br />
<br />The decision as to whether to include one or both elements of the name
<br />
depends very much on how the mapping process between URI and local name
<br />
(and by implication between one local name and another) is to be
<br />
achieved (see point (c) below).
<br />
<br />c) Should the mapping process take place within CF supported processes
<br />
or by an external mechanism?
<br />
According to the original proposal the mapping would be achieved by
<br />
registering both a common_concept metadata bundle and a
<br />
namespace:scoped_name with CF.  This, coupled with the proposed
<br />
automated registration procedure, would require CF to be responsible for
<br />
maintaining a machinable list of both these elements. The case for CF
<br />
providing this service from a central server has been further argued by
<br />
Frank and Bryan.
<br />
<br />John Graybeal, while supporting the establishment of a CF common_concept
<br />
registry, asked whether it would be appropriate for the mapping
<br />
mechanism from common_concept to local name to be entrenched within the
<br />
CF process.  He pointed out that the method of mapping from a CF
<br />
registered scoped name to another is a solution that is very local to
<br />
the CF community and asked whether the mapping from one vocabulary to
<br />
another should be done in cooperation with other organisations.
<br />
<br />John Caron asks whether mapping via an immutable URI is the best
<br />
approach because it allows only for the identity mapping between
<br />
common_concept/standard_name and another vocabulary.  The current
<br />
proposal does not address the construction of more complex relationships
<br />
such as finding broader or narrower terms than a particular scoped name.
<br />
However, the important point for this discussion is that John also
<br />
proposes splitting the job of naming the common_concept from that of
<br />
mapping and that the attribute should not attempt to encapsulate the
<br />
mapping mechanism.
<br />
<br />Jonathan suggests that the mapping between the URI and the local name
<br />
should be performed by servers within each institution.  He prefers the
<br />
suggestion of giving the URI and the local name in separate attributes,
<br />
but does not support registering the local names in the CF standard.
<br />
<br />As mentioned in my point 2, Steve Hankin has expressed the view that CF
<br />
should not act as a registry even for the URIs because of the potential
<br />
for namespace collision.  Individual institutions/ data centres would
<br />
then be responsible for mapping their own names to the CF attributes.
<br />
<br />7. Conclusion
<br />
The most important point to draw out is that we have a unanimous
<br />
consensus that the common_concept, as a means of bundling together a
<br />
number of attributes or as a synonym for standard names, will be a
<br />
useful addition to the CF conventions.  We must therefore work to
<br />
resolve the outstanding issues that have been raised during the
<br />
discussion.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Progress now rests on reaching a decision on whether CF should act as a
<br />
registry for the common_concept attribute bundles (and presumably
<br />
associate them with a URI), local scoped names, or both.  I would say
<br />
that we are very close to achieving consensus that CF should register
<br />
the common_concept bundles but we are rather further away from consensus
<br />
on whether to register the local names.  Making a decision on this point
<br />
will also clarify what the content of the common_concept attribute
<br />
should be.
<br />
<br />In any case, I think it will not be possible to finalise all the details
<br />
of a second draft proposal until the outcomes of ticket 29 (CDL as a
<br />
constraint language) and 27 (on namespace tags) are decided.  However, I
<br />
hope that this summary will provide a starting point for developing a
<br />
second draft.  The second draft should make clear:
<br />
a) its scope (i.e., bundling together attributes that already form part
<br />
an agreed of the CF conventions);
<br />
b) a common_concept can consist of a standard_name only;
<br />
c) the registration process for the common concept.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
