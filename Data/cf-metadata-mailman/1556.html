<br />
Dear Jonathan, Philip, Martina, et al.,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first of all: many thanks for carrying this forward! This is now
<br />
becoming especially important because there is an operational service for
<br />
atmospheric composition on the horizon which will need a good standard
<br />
definition of its output. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a couple of points to make in response to the recent emails:
<br />
<br />1) origin of the new proposal:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as Martina stated in her email, the current proposal was directly based
<br />
on another proposal to WMO for a new definition of chemistry variables in
<br />
the GRIB2 format. GRIB2 is the format that will be used as standard by ECMWF
<br />
for its data products and there is another committee deciding on its
<br />
adoption. The big first step will be to see general acceptance of the
<br />
proposed structure which is to separate physical quantity from species name:
<br />
one GRIB table for each of these.
<br />
<br />2) synergies with CF:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our hope was that we could try to harmonize the GRIB2 and CF efforts as
<br />
much as possible so that a translation between the two would become
<br />
straightforward. Various people have worked on the names that have now been
<br />
suggested and these were in part different people than on the original
<br />
&quot;atmospheric chemistry and aerosols&quot; proposal, where in particular
<br />
Christiane textor had a leading role. Apparently this has led to some small
<br />
inconsistencies between the existing (accepted) standard names and the new
<br />
suggestions. I hope that these can be resolved without too much ado and that
<br />
the revisions can also be carried back to the GRIB2 world if that proposal
<br />
gets through at WMO.
<br />
<br />3) conceptual remarks:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while perhaps not each and every chemical constituent listed in the
<br />
proposal will be regularly output immediately, we believe that the present
<br />
list is a reasonable compromise to cover the needs for a couple of years to
<br />
come. Since GRIB defines specific code numbers for individual variables, we
<br />
thought it is more important to settle on a rather complete list now instead
<br />
of adding names later which might lead to a lot of confusion about specific
<br />
code numbers. This philosophy differs from CF, but I believe it is possible
<br />
to reach a compromise here. What I see as most important right now is to
<br />
create the opportunity to develop a 1:1 mapping betwen GRIB2 codes and CF
<br />
standard names, and if we fuss too much about specific constituents, this
<br />
goal will be lost. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case in point is the definition of &quot;lumped&quot; species, which indeed was
<br />
carried out earlier with no final conclusion. Now is the time when we
<br />
actually need something like this and so we should reach a compromise here.
<br />
There is indeed a difference between &quot;total&quot; and &quot;lumped&quot; and the latter is
<br />
vague on purpose. In the GRIB species list we developed compound groups
<br />
(similar to the JPL rate constant tables) as HOx species, NOx species,
<br />
carbon-containing species, aerosols and &quot;project specific variables&quot;. The
<br />
latter contain all variables that are &quot;reasonably well defined&quot; within the
<br />
community but too unspecific or variable to be a universal standard across
<br />
communities. It may be that this is what is meant with the common_concept
<br />
proposal, but frankly this discussion goes over my head (with the limited
<br />
time I can devote to these matters). From a practicality standpoint I would
<br />
like to suggest to include these community specific standard names (and keep
<br />
the name &quot;lumped&quot; rather than &quot;total&quot;). Since there is a definition sentence
<br />
attached to each standard name, this definition could clearly indicate for
<br />
all &quot;lumped&quot; species that this is a community specific definition and may
<br />
vary between applications/models/projects.
<br />
<br />4) structure:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most important point in bringing together the GRIB2 and CF
<br />
proposals wa the recognition that atmospheric chemsitry and aerosol
<br />
variables require a matrix rather than a vector for their definition. Hence
<br />
the separation of physical parameter and species in the GRIB2 proposal. Of
<br />
course the matrix will contain many zeros and somewhere these must be
<br />
identified (or the non-zero elements must be identified), but for the
<br />
purpose of defining the new terms it is probably best to lead the discussion
<br />
on the parameters separately from the discussion of the species names and to
<br />
delay the specific agreement on standard_names until each of these two
<br />
points has been resolved.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the parameter names I just had a conversation with
<br />
Christiane Textor who alerted me to 
<br />
(i) the guidelines page on
<br />
<a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/guidelines">http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/guidelines</a>
<br />
and 
<br />
(ii) the Wiki on
<br />
<a href="http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/CF_Standard_Names_-_Future_Atmospheric_Che">http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/CF_Standard_Names_-_Future_Atmospheric_Che</a>
<br />
mistry_and_Aerosol_Terms 
<br />
which contains a number of (unfortunately outdated) tables on the topic.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it would be best if somehow the information on the physical
<br />
parameter space (i.e. standard_names with an X instead of a specific species
<br />
name  - just as Martina has written them in her section 1) could be brought
<br />
together again in one place so that it can be expanded more easily. What is
<br />
needed in my opinion is something in between Christiane's Wiki table (which
<br />
allows too many combinations of compartment, medium, position, etc.) and the
<br />
standard_name table
<br />
(<a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/9/cf-standard-name-tab">http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/9/cf-standard-name-tab</a>
<br />
le.html) which spells out each term for all compounds to which it applies.
<br />
Thus, I like Martina's &quot;X&quot; terms together with an explanation and a units
<br />
string.
<br />

<br />
<br />Martin Schultz
