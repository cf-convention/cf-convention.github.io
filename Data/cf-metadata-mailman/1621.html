Dear all
<br />
<br />I think there are two kinds of difficulty with additions to the standard name
<br />
table which need to be distinguished. First, there is the problem of the
<br />
standard name table getting very large because of the possibly large number of
<br />
chemical species. That presents a problem of organisation of metadata, but it
<br />
does not cause delays in assigning standard names. It is easy to add lots more
<br />
standard names which follow the same patterns as existing ones. Second, there
<br />
is the problem of delays when requests are made for new standard names. This
<br />
problem is caused by the intellectual difficulties of working out what the
<br />
concepts are and what the names for them should be.
<br />
<br />As discussed e.g. by Heinke, Martin and Philip, we could avoid the first
<br />
problem by adopting species-independent standard names. I would favour a
<br />
syntax which identifies where to look for the species name,
<br />
e.g. mass_concentration_of_[VAR]_in_air, where VAR is the name of the
<br />
string-valued coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable that names the
<br />
species, and [] is a special syntax. That kind of syntax would allow more than
<br />
one place-holder, which may be necessary because some quantities might
<br />
identify more than one species e.g. reaction rates or the existing ones of the
<br />
kind mole_concentration_of_[VAR1]_in_sea_water_expressed_as_[VAR2], where VAR1
<br />
could be have the value &quot;mesozooplankton&quot; and VAR2 the value &quot;nitrogen&quot;. The
<br />
lists of what can fill the gaps could, as has been suggested, be maintained by
<br />
groups with the relevant expertise.
<br />
<br />I think that a stronger argument for this than the size of the standard name
<br />
table, which should be no problem for software, is that chemical models may
<br />
internally have array dimensions for species, in which case it would be
<br />
natural to write out arrays of results. Are the models indeed like that?
<br />
<br />If we take this kind of approach, any combination of standard name and species
<br />
would be possible, as only the contents of the lists would be regulated, not
<br />
the combinations. There would not be a way to prevent nonsense such as mass
<br />
concentration of mesozooplankton in air. However, I don't think that's a
<br />
problem really. We currently have no way to prevent sea_water_temperature with
<br />
a height coordinate of 10 km above the ground, and that's not a problem.
<br />
<br />The second issue is more difficult. As I have argued before, I do not think it
<br />
can be helped by allowing projects to develop independent tables if we want to
<br />
use standard names to compare data from different sources. That is one of the
<br />
main reasons they are useful, I think, as Seth says too, and it's why they are
<br />
called &quot;standard&quot;.  If there were many tables, of course it would become
<br />
easier to add new names within projects, but interoperability would be lost
<br />
among projects. Interoperability can be maintained by across tables by
<br />
mappings (ontologies) but that is hard work. With more tables it would be
<br />
harder work. Who would do it? Dividing up the standard name table would
<br />
compound the intellectual difficulty, rather than easing the problem.
<br />
<br />So why is agreement of new standard names slow? I think it is because it is
<br />
difficult. It is not principally because we are arguing about syntax (though
<br />
it is partly), but because we are working out what we actually mean, and how
<br />
to describe it in ways consistent with other quantities we have defined. That
<br />
is, I think the slowness is mostly about the the definition, not about the
<br />
meaningful identifier, in Bryan's terms. It is largely a scientific and
<br />
communication problem, not a technological one. (As an example, at the end of
<br />
this email I have listed some of the issues that Stephen Griffies and I have
<br />
just been discussing in order to make proposals for standard names for ocean
<br />
quantities to be requested by CMIP5.) I do not see any easy way to dissolve
<br />
this difficulty. We can move it around or conceal it, but not easily get rid
<br />
of it.  If we want to reduce the difficulty of the problem, we could choose to
<br />
lower the standards currently applied to the clarity of concepts. That would
<br />
mean that projects using standard names would have to decide for themselves
<br />
more about what they meant before using them, or suffer more confusion through
<br />
not doing so, and interoperability would be reduced too. CF would do less
<br />
work, and would be less useful as a result. But if we decide to go that way, I
<br />
for one won't complain about doing less work. I don't do it for fun!
<br />
<br />I agree with Steve H that technology could help to ease the problem, though,
<br />
by providing more tools. Could we provide tools to allow it to be easier to
<br />
search standard names in cleverer ways? It might be that the ocean names I've
<br />
been discussing with Stephen G could have been chosen more quickly if it had
<br />
been easier to search the existing names, as many of the quantities that
<br />
appeared to be new did actually have existing names.  Could tools be written
<br />
to digest the table into those phrases and words from which the existing names
<br />
are constructed, and to present menus which allow construction of names from
<br />
the existing elements, with the possibility of proposing new elements to be
<br />
inserted in existing patterns? That would be a big help.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br />Some issues in defining ocean standard names:
<br />
- Basin masks for tracer and velocity are the same geophysical quantity, but
<br />
distinguished by coordinates. Grids are not identified by standard names; that
<br />
is an issue of how CF organises metadata.
<br />
- We say &quot;sea floor&quot;, not &quot;ocean bottom&quot;. You could say either, but in a set
<br />
of definitions it is important to be consistent about terminology, or the
<br />
reader will wonder if a distinction is being drawn.
<br />
- If you speak of the mass of the ocean, does it include sea-ice?
<br />
- We do not need a separate name for global-mean sea water temperature; we can
<br />
use sea_water_temperature and indicate the mean in cell_methods. That's another
<br />
issue of organisation of metadata.
<br />
- What does &quot;ideal age&quot; of sea water mean?
<br />
- Is the vertical integral of mass transport in an ocean model with a free
<br />
surface to be regarded as the same geophysical quantity as the vertical
<br />
integral of volume transport in a rigid-lid model multiplied by density?
<br />
- Is the mixed-layer depth determined by a buoyancy criterion the same concept
<br />
as mixed-layer depth determined by sigma-theta?
<br />
- Is the sea water &quot;mixing depth&quot; the same concept as mixed-layer depth defined
<br />
by the mixing scheme?
<br />
- Transports across various straits are all the same geophysical quantity, and
<br />
the strait should be identified by some string-valued coordinate.
<br />
- Do we want to know the rainfall flux over the whole grid box, or just the
<br />
part that falls into the liquid water (and not on the sea-ice)? These can be
<br />
distinguished by cell_methods.
<br />
- What's a clear way to describe the heat flux associated with the temperature
<br />
of rainfall not being the same as the temperature of the ocean it falls into?
