<br />
<br />Seth et al.,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed, this sounds like the right concept to follow: let CF define the
<br />
principle and let the communities organize themselves to fill in one or
<br />
several tables. Of course, it also raises many questions, but all-in-all I
<br />
would advocate that this is the way forward. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I would nevertheless propose that the CF core group
<br />
(and this discussion list) plays an active role in guiding the principles
<br />
and reviewing proposed name spaces. Specifically for the atmospheric
<br />
chemistry discussion my suggestion would be to agree (as soon as possible)
<br />
on the &quot;syntax definition&quot; of the standard names (I hope that Martina
<br />
Stockhause has an up-to-date version of her proposal including your helpful
<br />
comments), i.e. basically the
<br />
&quot;&lt;physical_quantity&gt;_of_X_in_&lt;medium&gt;_as_&lt;identity&gt;&quot; level of Martina's
<br />
proposal. The chemistry community could then among themselves agree on the
<br />
species names (or if not then we will have two or three species lists) and
<br />
construct (and maintain) the &quot;full-blown tables&quot; according to the general CF
<br />
rules. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this would require though is some form of registration process for
<br />
the community which includes a link to a standard repository of names
<br />
defined and maintained by this community. And of course, the CF site should
<br />
then have links (and occasional communication) with the registered
<br />
communities.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think this is exactly the same as the &quot;common concept&quot; proposal,
<br />
because the one identifying attribute would still simply be called
<br />
&quot;standard_name&quot;. However, somewhere in the global attribute section the file
<br />
should contain an identifier of the communities whose name definitions were
<br />
used. Should this be in the Convention attribute? (example: &quot;CF1.2, ACC1.0&quot;)
<br />
I don't know....
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Martin
<br />
<br />PS: another question is where the community name discussions would take
<br />
place. In order to keep things together at least a bit, I would propose to
<br />
add mailing lists for the registered communities at cgd.ucar.edu (example
<br />
cf-acc at cgd.ucar.edu) if this is possible.

<br />
<br />Dear all
<br />
<br />I think there are two kinds of difficulty with additions to the standard
<br />
name table which need to be distinguished. First, there is the problem of
<br />
the standard name table getting very large because of the possibly large
<br />
number of chemical species. That presents a problem of organisation of
<br />
metadata, but it does not cause delays in assigning standard names. It is
<br />
easy to add lots more standard names which follow the same patterns as
<br />
existing ones. Second, there is the problem of delays when requests are made
<br />
for new standard names. This problem is caused by the intellectual
<br />
difficulties of working out what the concepts are and what the names for
<br />
them should be.
<br />
<br />As discussed e.g. by Heinke, Martin and Philip, we could avoid the first
<br />
problem by adopting species-independent standard names. I would favour a
<br />
syntax which identifies where to look for the species name, e.g.
<br />
mass_concentration_of_[VAR]_in_air, where VAR is the name of the
<br />
string-valued coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable that names
<br />
the species, and [] is a special syntax. That kind of syntax would allow
<br />
more than one place-holder, which may be necessary because some quantities
<br />
might identify more than one species e.g. reaction rates or the existing
<br />
ones of the kind
<br />
mole_concentration_of_[VAR1]_in_sea_water_expressed_as_[VAR2], where VAR1
<br />
could be have the value &quot;mesozooplankton&quot; and VAR2 the value &quot;nitrogen&quot;. The
<br />
lists of what can fill the gaps could, as has been suggested, be maintained
<br />
by groups with the relevant expertise.
<br />
<br />I think that a stronger argument for this than the size of the standard name
<br />
table, which should be no problem for software, is that chemical models may
<br />
internally have array dimensions for species, in which case it would be
<br />
natural to write out arrays of results. Are the models indeed like that?
<br />
<br />If we take this kind of approach, any combination of standard name and
<br />
species would be possible, as only the contents of the lists would be
<br />
regulated, not the combinations. There would not be a way to prevent
<br />
nonsense such as mass concentration of mesozooplankton in air. However, I
<br />
don't think that's a problem really. We currently have no way to prevent
<br />
sea_water_temperature with a height coordinate of 10 km above the ground,
<br />
and that's not a problem.
<br />
<br />The second issue is more difficult. As I have argued before, I do not think
<br />
it can be helped by allowing projects to develop independent tables if we
<br />
want to use standard names to compare data from different sources. That is
<br />
one of the main reasons they are useful, I think, as Seth says too, and it's
<br />
why they are called &quot;standard&quot;.  If there were many tables, of course it
<br />
would become easier to add new names within projects, but interoperability
<br />
would be lost among projects. Interoperability can be maintained by across
<br />
tables by mappings (ontologies) but that is hard work. With more tables it
<br />
would be harder work. Who would do it? Dividing up the standard name table
<br />
would compound the intellectual difficulty, rather than easing the problem.
<br />
<br />So why is agreement of new standard names slow? I think it is because it is
<br />
difficult. It is not principally because we are arguing about syntax (though
<br />
it is partly), but because we are working out what we actually mean, and how
<br />
to describe it in ways consistent with other quantities we have defined.
<br />
That is, I think the slowness is mostly about the the definition, not about
<br />
the meaningful identifier, in Bryan's terms. It is largely a scientific and
<br />
communication problem, not a technological one. (As an example, at the end
<br />
of this email I have listed some of the issues that Stephen Griffies and I
<br />
have just been discussing in order to make proposals for standard names for
<br />
ocean quantities to be requested by CMIP5.) I do not see any easy way to
<br />
dissolve this difficulty. We can move it around or conceal it, but not
<br />
easily get rid of it.  If we want to reduce the difficulty of the problem,
<br />
we could choose to lower the standards currently applied to the clarity of
<br />
concepts. That would mean that projects using standard names would have to
<br />
decide for themselves more about what they meant before using them, or
<br />
suffer more confusion through not doing so, and interoperability would be
<br />
reduced too. CF would do less work, and would be less useful as a result.
<br />
But if we decide to go that way, I for one won't complain about doing less
<br />
work. I don't do it for fun!
<br />
<br />I agree with Steve H that technology could help to ease the problem, though,
<br />
by providing more tools. Could we provide tools to allow it to be easier to
<br />
search standard names in cleverer ways? It might be that the ocean names
<br />
I've been discussing with Stephen G could have been chosen more quickly if
<br />
it had been easier to search the existing names, as many of the quantities
<br />
that appeared to be new did actually have existing names.  Could tools be
<br />
written to digest the table into those phrases and words from which the
<br />
existing names are constructed, and to present menus which allow
<br />
construction of names from the existing elements, with the possibility of
<br />
proposing new elements to be inserted in existing patterns? That would be a
<br />
big help.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br />Some issues in defining ocean standard names:
<br />
- Basin masks for tracer and velocity are the same geophysical quantity, but
<br />
distinguished by coordinates. Grids are not identified by standard names;
<br />
that is an issue of how CF organises metadata.
<br />
- We say &quot;sea floor&quot;, not &quot;ocean bottom&quot;. You could say either, but in a set
<br />
of definitions it is important to be consistent about terminology, or the
<br />
reader will wonder if a distinction is being drawn.
<br />
- If you speak of the mass of the ocean, does it include sea-ice?
<br />
- We do not need a separate name for global-mean sea water temperature; we
<br />
can use sea_water_temperature and indicate the mean in cell_methods. That's
<br />
another issue of organisation of metadata.
<br />
- What does &quot;ideal age&quot; of sea water mean?
<br />
- Is the vertical integral of mass transport in an ocean model with a free
<br />
surface to be regarded as the same geophysical quantity as the vertical
<br />
integral of volume transport in a rigid-lid model multiplied by density?
<br />
- Is the mixed-layer depth determined by a buoyancy criterion the same
<br />
concept as mixed-layer depth determined by sigma-theta?
<br />
- Is the sea water &quot;mixing depth&quot; the same concept as mixed-layer depth
<br />
defined by the mixing scheme?
<br />
- Transports across various straits are all the same geophysical quantity,
<br />
and the strait should be identified by some string-valued coordinate.
<br />
- Do we want to know the rainfall flux over the whole grid box, or just the
<br />
part that falls into the liquid water (and not on the sea-ice)? These can be
<br />
distinguished by cell_methods.
<br />
- What's a clear way to describe the heat flux associated with the
<br />
temperature of rainfall not being the same as the temperature of the ocean
<br />
it falls into?

<br />Let me just add that a URI datatype is useful not just for external
<br />
references, but it is also useful for local references as well, e.g.
<br />
instead of cf:grid_mapping being a string that is the name of a local
<br />
variable, it would be a URI that points to a local variable (i.e.
<br />
probably still that same variable name).  Seemingly a minor distinction, but
<br />
it allows a clean mapping into an object-oriented framework for information
<br />
in netcdf files.  LIke RDF, or Java Beans, or ...

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; common_concept in particular (Trac Ticket #24), and where the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a need for a framework for using namespaces in netcdf, both with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes (so attributes can be explicitly placed in different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventions, not the issue here per se), and attribute values (so that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes can point to URI's identifying concepts).   My short
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; version of this is that cf:standard_name is a property that points to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a single controlled vocabulary (i.e. a string chosen from a list), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while the proposed cf:common_concept is a property that points to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts identified with URI's (e.g. namespace plus value).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard_name's could have URI's as well (Roy Lowry has assigned 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opaque URI's to all the standard names, MMI has assigned more readable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; URIs to many of the standard_names (e.g. cf:air_temperature), CF could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very well get a URN space of its own which will allow it to create 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some definitive URIs, which lets us relate cf:standard_name's to other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vocabularies (Roy has done this as well), and would let us write down 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships between standard_names (Roy is working on this).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The attribute namespace problem is easier, and we discussed a couple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of possible solutions which we hope to sort out by actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementing them.  namespaces for values seems trickier at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment, because netcdf (unlike DAP) does not have a URI datatype, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so even if one had a list of namespaces specified as id #24, one would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be sure which string-valued properties have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; namespace-abbreviated without reading through some document that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describes each property in the convention, a level of sophistication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the reading software we would like to avoid.  Of course, one does

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not need to abbreviate -- a URN in particular should be quite readable

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what I think you're implying is that there would be a single 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; authority (CF) tying together all those names (e.g., using the CF 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; aliases to bring the names from different namespaces together).  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There are two ways to do that, but I don't think aliases or a 'single 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; authority' (in the way you imply it) is the right model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think a better model is to consider the CF standard names one of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the major namespaces, to which many other vocabularies can be mapped.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then, modify the CF standard to allow the specification of a term 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from any namespace (since many terms may not be appropriate to the CF 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; vocabulary; see my comment on CF scope in the last post); this is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proposal I've been back-burnering for about 9 months now.  Finally, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; CF can accept any or all well-framed names that are in any of these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; namespaces, or can even alias to them, through manual or semi-automated
</em><br />
processes.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Under this model, CF has a mind share on solving this problem with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; particular approach, but CF users can take advantage of other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; approaches. CF doesn't have to take on the 'vocabulary publication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and mediation' task for the entire community, but can pick and choose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; its own targets for inclusion in the CF vocabulary (and the targets 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will be much more conspicuous and contextually defined).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There are multiple complexities that arise as you start trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; make this concept (mine, yours, or CF's) work -- I like to think our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MMI plans know about 85% of the issues in a fully operational but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; basic system -- and it isn't clear whether you'll want many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; organizations serving the results, or relatively few.  But the model 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can put a lot more precise naming and mapping capability into action 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in a very short period of time (we hope to go live in a matter of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; weeks), and should make clear the difference in scope between what CF is
</em><br />
currently addressing, and what needs to be accommodated.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Having said all that, I would like CF's model of &quot;meaningful, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; coherent, well-structured names&quot; to be a paradigm that is maintained. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If one group uses opaque codes, I would rather not see CF start 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; including those just because they are acceptable to some. One of CF's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; big strengths is the &quot;instant interoperability&quot; you get from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recognizing and understanding the name.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; With regard to the standard names problem, here's a perhaps-mad idea

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; from someone standing on the sidelines.  I don't think this idea has

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; been floated before, but I may have missed it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Where I'm coming from:  I'm the data manager for a modeling project 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; (NARCCAP, <a href="http://narccap.ucar.edu">http://narccap.ucar.edu</a>) that's using the CF standard.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; don't generate or use any of the project's data, I'm just in charge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of checking it to make sure it's properly formatted and trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; make things usable for the community that will use the data.  From 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; my perspective, the really important thing about standard names is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that if two different files have a variable with the same standard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; name, it means (1) they're talking about the same thing, and (2) a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; user can go somewhere and look up the definition and the canonical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; units.  The fact that the name has passed through an approval process is
</em><br />
entirely incidental.
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; So... why not just let any group that wants to define a set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; standard names for their community do so, as long as they're willing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to also take charge of publishing a Standard Name Table for it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Essentially, it would be creating namespaces.  The only mechanism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that would need to be added would be some way of noting which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; namespace the name comes from and the URL of the corresponding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Standard Name Table.  So, for example, maybe for chemical names, all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the standard names would all start with &quot;iupac:&quot; and somewhere in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the global attributes for the file you'd have &quot;standard_namespaces =
</em><br />
(default:
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cf-standard-name-table.xml,  chem:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; www.iupac.org/cf/standard-names-3.0.xml)&quot;.  Or something like that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Each community can manage its own namespace.  There's already a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mechanism in place (aliases) that could be extended to handle cases 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; where there are two different names for one thing.  And if you end 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; up with two names for the same thing with different dimensions or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; slightly different definitions, that's fine, because that situation
</em><br />
already exists in the single table.
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  (Rain, for example, can be defined as a mass flux per unit area
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; (precipitation_flux) or as an accumulated depth 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; (lwe_thickness_of_precipitation_amount).  They're different ways of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about the same physical thing.  So this is not a new problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; for the user.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Put some bounds on the representational domain that the default 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; standard name table will handle, delegate everything else to whoever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; in that community wants to deal with it, and no matter how many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; groups come to CF with new standard names, the system can handle it.
</em><br />
Right?

<br />... I agree with Philip and would like to re-inforce that I think species as
<br />
individual variables are much easier to handle. Usually, the model outputs
<br />
only a subset of the species it calculates (who cares about the ethylperoxy
<br />
radical concentrations, for example?), and array indexing on the results
<br />
means that one always has to manage an extra dimension and keep track of
<br />
what index 1 stands for. This is a bit like the early days of the GRIB
<br />
concept when every group had their own table and ozone, for example, was
<br />
&quot;output variable 243&quot; in one model and &quot;output variable 128&quot; in the other.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, however, that there is a fuzzy divide with respect to aerosol size
<br />
classes or the &quot;new&quot; dimension of &quot;mesozooplankton&quot; etc. (Gas-phase is EASY
<br />
in spite of the 4500 compounds ;-)
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Martin
<br />
<br />PS: re Jonathan - very valid points! In the end it will probably be the tool
<br />
question that determines the extent to which CF will be used. I know that
<br />
this is extra work (and I don't want to do it!), but in some of the previous
<br />
discussions I had the feeling that the semantics or syntax discussion of new
<br />
standard names focused entirely on the human brain, which had proven
<br />
notorioulsy difficult in the past to be implemented in software rules.
<br />
Perhaps it it time to check the existing standard name definitions if or how
<br />
they could be &quot;parsed&quot; by such tools. My guess is that, overal it should
<br />
work reasonably well (if there are certain key words like &quot;_in_&quot;, &quot;_of_&quot;,
<br />
&quot;_as_&quot;), but there might be a couple of terms which make a programmer's life
<br />
difficult. Then the question is: should these be revised even if they are so
<br />
standard (like &quot;air_temperature&quot;, which perhaps should be
<br />
&quot;temperature_of_air&quot; ?).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the &quot;two table&quot; approach: I believe we pretty much agree
<br />
here. What I meant to say is that the difficult problem should still be
<br />
sorted out in the CF main list, but the species table (or tables combining
<br />
marine life forms with species, etc.) could be maintained by a
<br />
sub-committee, i.e. community.
