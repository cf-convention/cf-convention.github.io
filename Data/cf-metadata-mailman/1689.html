<br />
Dear all,
<br />
<br />It seems to me that the issue of possibly wanting to store several 
<br />
different chemical species in a single array (with a coordinate variable 
<br />
identifying the species) is only one limitation of the current 
<br />
constraints placed by standard names.  We've also run up against the 
<br />
following difficulties:
<br />
<br />1)  Currently it is impossible to identify with a single standard name, 
<br />
closely related variables that one might want to store in a single 
<br />
array).  For example, such quantities as:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  temperatures measured with several different instruments.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  precipitation separated into categories of snow and ice
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  concentrations of a molecule (e.g., CO2) separated into 
<br />
components defined by its source (fossil fuel combustion, volcanic 
<br />
emissions, respiration, decay, etc.) [some have talked about 
<br />
distinguishing these contributions by am artificial &quot;color&quot; label]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  the contributions of various &quot;processes&quot; to a particular 
<br />
quantity (e.g., temperature tendency due to advection, deep_convection, 
<br />
short_wave_radiation, etc.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  a variable, as simulated by several different models
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* and the like
<br />
<br />2) thresholds and similar things
<br />
<br />3) various combinations of variables or operations/transformations, such as:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* anomalies and more generally differences
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* products (e.g., transports, correlations, etc.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* and the like
<br />
<br />I think it is perhaps time to consider devising an alternative way of 
<br />
providing the information that is currently in the standard name 
<br />
(instead of forcing all the information into a single attribute).  As 
<br />
you will see, this will eliminate the above limitations, but perhaps 
<br />
more importantly it provides a way of more quickly converging on new 
<br />
standard names.
<br />
<br />The idea, which I'm sure must have been discussed at length already (but 
<br />
I've forgotten by now or I've missed it entirely), is to parse the 
<br />
quantity identification information into separate elements (or 
<br />
&quot;categories&quot; or &quot;components&quot;).  We already do this to a certain extent 
<br />
by providing some information in the cell_methods attribute.  I would 
<br />
build on the bits of independent information already listed in the 
<br />
Guidelines for Construction of CF Standard Names 
<br />
(<a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/guidelines">http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/guidelines</a>).
<br />
We might, for example, parse air_temperature and sea_water_temperature 
<br />
into two independent attributes.  medium=&quot;sea_water&quot; or &quot;air&quot; and 
<br />
quantity=&quot;temperature&quot;
<br />
<br />These independent bits of information could be automatically assembled 
<br />
together to create the &quot;standard name&quot;.  The current standard names 
<br />
would in some cases be identical to the names created from the elements, 
<br />
and in other cases we could establish aliases. This would make it 
<br />
obvious in many cases how to construct new standard names, and in any 
<br />
case would impose a structure on the standard names.
<br />
<br />The main job of the standard name committee would be to agree on when a 
<br />
new *component* should be added and agree on the list of acceptable 
<br />
values for each component.  This would force everyone to think about 
<br />
whether a new variable can be distinguished from others simply by adding 
<br />
a new value to one of the components, or if an entirely new category 
<br />
(i.e., component) is needed.
<br />
<br />As a first step, it might be useful to consider the following components 
<br />
(many of which appear in the &quot;guidelines&quot; document referred to above):
<br />
<br />1. quantity:  the fundamental quantity (e.g., temperature, pressure, 
<br />
geopotential_height, precipitation_rate, concentration)
<br />
<br />2. medium:  where the quantity is &quot;measured&quot; (e.g., sea, atmosphere (or 
<br />
air?), sea_ice, troposphere, lake, stream land_ice, cloud, 
<br />
ocean_surface_mixed_layer)
<br />
<br />3. constituent: e.g., hydrometeor, ice, snow, rain, CO2, SO4, ozone, 
<br />
aerosol, sulfate_aerosol, soot.
<br />
<br />4. specie_color:  for when we want to distinguish constituents by what 
<br />
produced them (e.g. the sulfate aerosol in the atmosphere that comes 
<br />
from different sources: anthropogenic, natural, fossil_fuel, etc.)
<br />
<br />5. surface: a quasi-horizontal surface that cannot easily be described 
<br />
by a vertical coordinate (e.g., sea_floor, top_of_atmosphere, 
<br />
tropopause, adiabatic_condensation_level, surface)
<br />
<br />6. process: identifying what process is responsible for the quantity 
<br />
(e.g., for temperature tendencies: radiation, convection, 
<br />
latent_heating, etc.) [I wonder if specie_color might be combined with 
<br />
&quot;process&quot; into a single category?]
<br />
<br />7. vector_component: indicating the component of a vector and its 
<br />
positive direction (e.g., eastward, northward, upward)
<br />
<br />8. radiative_flux_component: indicating whether only the downwelling 
<br />
(incoming) or upwelling (outgoing) or net radiative flux is stored
<br />
<br />9. tensor_component: ????
<br />
<br />10. assumption: indicating that the quantity has been calculated under 
<br />
some assumption (e.g., assuming_clear_sky, assuming_no_snow)
<br />
<br />11. threshold: indicating that the quantity has been calculated only 
<br />
when certain conditions are satisfied.  The form of this attribute would 
<br />
have to be worked out, but presumably would identify both the 
<br />
condition(s) and the values (or variables containing the values) of the 
<br />
thresholds could be specified.
<br />
<br />The remaining 6 categories might not be considered part of the 
<br />
&quot;standard_name&quot; information, but might better be defined as new variable 
<br />
attributes:
<br />
<br />12. formula (or transformation?): indicating that in some sense the 
<br />
quantity is a &quot;compound&quot; quantity derivable from more fundamental 
<br />
quantities.  surface_net_downward_radiative_flux would have a 
<br />
formula=&quot;sw + lw&quot;, and the data writer would also store in the file a 
<br />
dummy variable (i.e., it would be either a scalar or array with possibly 
<br />
only one element, which would be  set to missing_value), and the 
<br />
attributes associated with these two variables would define the quantity 
<br />
stored (e.g., in this example, &quot;sw&quot; would have a standard name of 
<br />
surface_net_downward_shortwave_radiative_flux, and similarly for &quot;lw&quot;) 
<br />
As another example, a temporal correlation of quantity &quot;a&quot; and quantity 
<br />
&quot;b&quot; could be indicated by formula=&quot;correlation(a,b)&quot;.   As a third 
<br />
example, an &quot;anomaly&quot; could be represented as the difference between two 
<br />
variables, and the attributes associated with the variable representing 
<br />
the &quot;base&quot; state could explicitly indicate how it was calculated (e.g., 
<br />
for a climatology, the climatological period).  For the formula 
<br />
attribute,  we might consider adopting the syntax for the formula from 
<br />
something like matlab, I guess.  Note that the formula attribute makes 
<br />
it possible to express many different quantities without agreeing 
<br />
explicitly on their standard names (just the standard_names of their 
<br />
formula terms). Note also, that It is possible that the threshold 
<br />
information (#11 above) might be represented instead by an appropriate 
<br />
formula.
<br />
<br />13. measurement_method: indicating what type of sensor was used to 
<br />
measure the quantity (e.g., for sea surface temperature observations, 
<br />
bucket or ship_intake_temperature, and for models where there are 
<br />
multiple methods of defining cloud radiative forcing, specifying which 
<br />
of two well-know procedures known as &quot;method 1&quot; or &quot;method 2&quot; is used.
<br />
<br />14. area_type: indicating that instead of applying to the whole grid 
<br />
cell (which would be the default), the quantity applies only to a 
<br />
certain portion, as in the current &quot;where_type&quot; construction  (e.g., 
<br />
where_land would be indicated by &quot;land&quot;, and where_sea_ice would be 
<br />
indicated by &quot;sea_ice&quot;)
<br />
<br />15. region: specifying the geographic region from which the quantity is 
<br />
extracted (e.g., asia, africa, australia)
<br />
<br />16. experiment: containing the name of the experiment that produced the 
<br />
output.
<br />
<br />17. source:  containing some indication of the source of the data, 
<br />
whether it be from observations (e.g., ERBE) or from a model (e.g., 
<br />
CCSM3). A variable containing output from a multi-model ensemble 
<br />
(regridded to a common grid) could be stored with &quot;source&quot; as a 
<br />
dimension and the names of the models recorded as coordinate labels.
<br />
<br /><br />Any of these components of the standard_name might be omitted if either 
<br />
unnecessary, *or* if they themselves appeared as standard_names attached 
<br />
to one of the coordinate variables of the quantity.  Thus, for example, 
<br />
if the &quot;process' were left unspecified for a variable containing 
<br />
&quot;tendency_or_air_temperature&quot;, but one of the coordinates of that 
<br />
variable had the standard_name &quot;process&quot;, then one would find stored in 
<br />
this variable all the different processes identified by the coordinate 
<br />
labels for that coordinate.  This allows us to store many different 
<br />
tendencies in a single variable, but allows us to identify each of them 
<br />
through the &quot;process&quot; dimension of that variable.
<br />
<br />Turning now to the procedure for constructing new standard names:
<br />
<br />When constructing a new name, one would fill in the appropriate 
<br />
information for each of the components listed above (omitting those that 
<br />
are not needed).  If information seeming to lie outside the categories 
<br />
already listed in the table were necessary to fully define the quantity, 
<br />
then the requester would propose that a new category be adopted.  Within 
<br />
each category there would be a limited set of accepted designations 
<br />
(i.e. values), and again if none of the current acceptable values was 
<br />
appropriate, the requester would suggest a new one.
<br />
<br />The standard_name discussion would focus on 1) whether a new category 
<br />
was indeed needed and what the new category should be called, 2) whether 
<br />
a new value under a given category was needed and what that value should 
<br />
be, and 3) in many cases simply whether the user had correctly filled 
<br />
out the table.  [Alison could make a decision about 3) on her own in 
<br />
most cases, I suspect.]
<br />
<br />The second step would be to form a standard_name from the information in 
<br />
the table, but this should be nearly automatic, following some simple 
<br />
construction rules.
<br />
<br />If someone outside the current focus of CF wanted to use CF to store 
<br />
data (say someone from the biological community), they might begin by 
<br />
augmenting the components of the standard name with additional ones 
<br />
needed by their community.  They would be required to adopt existing 
<br />
&quot;categories&quot; when applicable to their discipline.
<br />
<br />Sorry for the length of this and sorry if it duplicates material in 
<br />
related discussions, but I think this standard_name business seems a bit 
<br />
out of control and perhaps there are alternatives out there that might 
<br />
make it more straight-forward to propose and adopt new names.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I hope someone out there cares enough to comment on or improve 
<br />
on or suggest alternatives to this proposal.  Whatever we do, we should 
<br />
be mindful that we must be able to determine when existing standard 
<br />
names are equivalent to any future representation of the standard name 
<br />
information.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
Karl
