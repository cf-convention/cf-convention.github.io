<br />
I love the list of classifiers and hope that discussion can continue.  
<br />
Having also tried to come up with a pervasive system for standard  
<br />
names (both in CF and in other contexts) over the years, here are some  
<br />
observations.
<br />
<br />Naming Effort: It appears CF standard names were originally Much More  
<br />
about coming up with the right name, and partially partitioning useful  
<br />
characteristics, than about a precise definition.  This reflects the  
<br />
original community needs, i think; as community needs for precision  
<br />
have grown, so has attention to the definition. But Jonathan is spot- 
<br />
on: getting a name that reflects both the meaning AND community usage  
<br />
has been the challenge. While it frustrates name proposers, it  
<br />
provides great comfort to users.
<br />
<br />Normalization and uniqueness: If I understand the proposal correctly,  
<br />
it calls for tracking all the orthogonal classifiers as possible  
<br />
components of the standard name. ('These independent bits of  
<br />
information could be automatically assembled together to create the  
<br />
&quot;standard name&quot;.') Is this any different from a database key  
<br />
construction from multiple independent columns of data? Each unique  
<br />
combination of the n components makes another possible name, and the  
<br />
meaning is encoded into the name itself. Exclusion of a component from  
<br />
the name means all values are accepted in that axis.
<br />
<br />Length and Complexity: It will be a Very Long standard name in many  
<br />
cases. No technical limitations, probably, but social reaction to  
<br />
these long names will be poor at best. (And will depend on some  
<br />
particularly clever way to indicate omitted categories when  
<br />
constructing the name.) Of course, more common cases will usually be  
<br />
shorter, but people won't always put in the relevant categories, or  
<br />
won't realize they are relevant. (&quot;Oh, c'mon, everyone knows that  
<br />
*has* to be over water.&quot;) Like filling out metadata, detail will be  
<br />
avoided during name creation, for better and for worse.
<br />
<br />Unique Identifiers for Resources: I agree with Benno: CF absolutely  
<br />
should have a separate resource identifier on the web for (a) all the  
<br />
existing and historical standard names, and (b) any name you come up  
<br />
in this system.  (I am separately engaged in creating and serving  
<br />
identifiers for vocabulary terms, so of course I would feel that way.   
<br />
We just now have a service that can provide this; I just started  
<br />
pursuing its application for/with CF.)  As an aside, this proposal may  
<br />
be a case where using opaque codes as the identifier, and the standard  
<br />
name as a label string, offers improved value to users.
<br />
<br />Unique Identifiers for Data Set Variable: This was proposed as a  
<br />
solution &quot;to identify with a single standard name, closely related  
<br />
variables that one might want to store in a single array&quot;. I  
<br />
discourage using standard names as &quot;the unique names for a data set&quot;,  
<br />
because there will always be a category for differentiating variables  
<br />
that isn't available in the standard convention. (primary vs secondary  
<br />
instrument, first/second/third installed sensor, clean/dirty, and on  
<br />
and on). Standard names should be used to describe each variable, not  
<br />
name it.
<br />
<br />Defining Similarity: For a variable mapping exercise, we considered  
<br />
what makes one thing the 'same as' something else. The answer is (of  
<br />
course) 'it depends'. The great advantage of this proposed approach is  
<br />
that it 'normalizes' the distinctions into the separate categories, so  
<br />
the user can evaluate the match much more directly for his or her own  
<br />
needs. But be aware that it will move the discussions of similarity  
<br />
and difference into the next layer of semantic detail (&quot;does 'body of  
<br />
water' include underground streams?&quot; and so on).
<br />
<br />Central Catalog: If the rules are deterministic, and every category  
<br />
has a controlled vocabulary, you don't need a single list of what  
<br />
names (i..e, combinations of categories) are approved; any possible  
<br />
combination of category terms is legal, right? This is fortunate, as  
<br />
the number of proposed names may indeed grow very large very quickly,  
<br />
and people will often just construct the names without bothering to  
<br />
submit them. You also don't need definitions; the definition is the  
<br />
compilation of all the displayed components in that name. (If it  
<br />
*isn't* the same as the aggregation, then there is by definition  
<br />
another axis of interest that needs to be turned into a category, or  
<br />
you will have 2 standard names that look the same but have different  
<br />
meanings.)  So this is really a system for creating a single-label  
<br />
categorization scheme across multiple axes; no catalog is strictly  
<br />
needed for the naming convention to work.
<br />
<br />Semantics and Ontologies: WIth this proposal, we are much further into  
<br />
creating classification systems for all concepts relevant to CF names  
<br />
(as opposed to conceptually linking the existing CF concepts, which is  
<br />
slightly different). I think this is inevitably a direction to be  
<br />
taken by someone -- witness the Plasmo work -- but it turns the  
<br />
process into something very much like other knowledge classification  
<br />
efforts in the semantic community. That isn't a pro or a con, just an  
<br />
observation. There are lessons to be learned and tools to be reused  
<br />
from work that has gone before. In that regard, I would love to be  
<br />
informed of existing vocabularies (formal or informal) that exist for  
<br />
each of these categories, particularly the first two. (Can we start a  
<br />
wiki page for this info somewhere?)
<br />
<br />In summary, I love this idea in principle, but think we can expect a  
<br />
stately progression toward seeing it in action. It serves a different  
<br />
need and audience than Standard Names, and so perhaps should be  
<br />
considered and developed separately, not necessarily as a replacement  
<br />
for them.
