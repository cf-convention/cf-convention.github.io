Dear Thomas,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your query.  It is not necessary to open a trac ticket
<br />
because discussion of standard names normally takes place on the mailing
<br />
list.
<br />
<br />I agree with Jonathan that the names themselves look fine, that
<br />
'displacement' is an appropriate term to describe the change in ice
<br />
position, and that it could be more widely applied in other standard
<br />
names should the need arise.  The way you have constructed the names is
<br />
consistent with other sea_ice and sea_water velocity names.
<br />
<br />Not all standard names proposals lead to a great deal of discussion.  I
<br />
think that your names are fairly straightforward and certainly nobody
<br />
has objected to them.  A very important part of including new names in
<br />
the table is to make sure the quantities are clearly defined.  Please
<br />
see below for my suggested wording of the descriptions based on the
<br />
short definitions you have already provided.  Please let me know if you
<br />
are happy with these or whether any clarifications are needed.
<br />
<br />As the next update to the standard name table will take place on Tuesday
<br />
11th November and we have not yet finalised the definitions I would
<br />
prefer not to include the displacement names on this occasion.  I try to
<br />
give a week's notice of planned changes to the table so that people can
<br />
check the list and hopefully catch any errors.  This also allows me time
<br />
to do the editing of the table itself.  Inevitably this means that on
<br />
occasion some names will just miss being included, but updates are done
<br />
every two months so there will not be a long delay before your names can
<br />
be added.   If we can agree the definitions I can formally accept the
<br />
names, which means that they will definitely go into the table on
<br />
January 13th and in the meantime you will be free to start using them to
<br />
write your data.  I hope that is an acceptable solution.
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_ice_displacement     [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  The time interval during which the motion took
<br />
place must be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate
<br />
variable.  A displacement is a vector quantity. Sea ice displacement is
<br />
defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.
<br />
&quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed
<br />
eastward (negative westward).  An eastward displacement is the distance
<br />
across the earth's surface calculated from the change in a moving
<br />
object's longitude during the interval given in the time bounds
<br />
variable.
<br />
<br />northward_sea_ice_displacement    [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  The time interval during which the motion took
<br />
place must be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate
<br />
variable.  A displacement is a vector quantity. Sea ice displacement is
<br />
defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.
<br />
&quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed
<br />
northward (negative southward).  A northward displacement is the
<br />
distance across the earth's surface calculated from the change in a
<br />
moving object's latitude during the interval given in the time bounds
<br />
variable.
<br />
<br />sea_ice_x_displacement            [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  The time interval during which the motion took
<br />
place must be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate
<br />
variable.  A displacement is a vector quantity. Sea ice displacement is
<br />
defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;x&quot;
<br />
indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, when this is not
<br />
true longitude, positive with increasing x.  An x displacement is
<br />
calculated from the difference in the moving object's grid x coordinate
<br />
between the start and end of the interval given in the time bounds
<br />
variable.
<br />
<br />sea_ice_y_displacement            [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  The time interval during which the motion took
<br />
place must be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate
<br />
variable.  A displacement is a vector quantity. Sea ice displacement is
<br />
defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;y&quot;
<br />
indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, when this is not
<br />
true longitude, positive with increasing y.  A y displacement is
<br />
calculated from the difference in the moving object's grid y coordinate
<br />
between the start and end of the interval given in the time bounds
<br />
variable.
<br />
<br />sea_ice_displacement
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  The time interval during which the motion took
<br />
place must be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate
<br />
variable. The displacement is the distance across the earth's surface
<br />
calculated from the change in a moving object's (lon,lat) position
<br />
between the start and end of the interval given in the time bounds
<br />
variable.  A displacement is a vector quantity.  Sea ice displacement is
<br />
defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.
<br />
<br />direction_of_sea_ice_displacement [degrees]
<br />
&quot;direction_of_X&quot; means direction of a vector, a bearing.  A displacement
<br />
is a vector quantity. Sea ice displacement is defined as a
<br />
two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  'Displacement'
<br />
means the change in geospatial position of an object that has moved over
<br />
time.  The time interval during which the motion took place must be
<br />
specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  The
<br />
displacement is the distance across the earth's surface calculated from
<br />
the change in a moving object's (lon,lat) position between the start and
<br />
end of the interval given in the time bounds variable.  The 'direction
<br />
of displacement' is the angle between due north and the displacement
<br />
vector.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Alison,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although there has been very little discussion on the topic, I had
</em><br />
come
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with some new standard names
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the satellite ice-drift product I am issuing. Those were not asked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for in the trac but in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mailing list (first mail sent on 24/10/2008). Those are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; eastward_sea_ice_displacement     [m] (length of [lon0,lon1] on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earth surface)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; northward_sea_ice_displacement    [m] (length of [lat0,lat1] on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earth surface)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; sea_ice_x_displacement            [m] (length from P0 to P1, taken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; along the grid's X axis)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; sea_ice_y_displacement            [m] (length from P0 to P1, taken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; along the grid's Y axis)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; sea_ice_displacement              [m] (the length [P0,P1] on Earth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; direction_of_sea_ice_displacement [degrees] (the direction to North
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the [P0,P1] vector)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are built on the 'sea_ice_velocity' model, which is already in
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; table of standard names.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Answer from Jonathan was (same day):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; These all look good to me. I agree that &quot;displacement&quot; conveys the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; moving from A to B. A displacement would be extensive in time, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; bounds would record the two measurement instants between which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; displacement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; occurred.  By contrast, a velocity is intensive in time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I am afraid nobody reacted or built upon this thread. Is it still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too early to include those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; names? Should I insert a proper entry in the trac system? Do you need
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better wordy description for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those variables?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just let me know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cheers,
</em><br />
