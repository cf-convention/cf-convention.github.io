Hi Alison and all,

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not all standard names proposals lead to a great deal of discussion.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that your names are fairly straightforward and certainly nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has objected to them.  A very important part of including new names in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the table is to make sure the quantities are clearly defined.  Please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see below for my suggested wording of the descriptions based on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; short definitions you have already provided.  Please let me know if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are happy with these or whether any clarifications are needed.
</em><br />
I think I am mostly happy with those definitions and am absolutely ok to wait until next release 
<br />
(January 09) before having those names in the standard table. It will give me the opportunity to 1) 
<br />
work on those definitions with the CF list and 2) work on those definitions with my satellite 
<br />
ice-drift colleagues which (I guess) are not participating to this list? (that's a call :-) )
<br />
<br />As each of your definition is more or less based on the same scheme, I will try to analyse/comment 
<br />
the first definition and then refer to it for the others. At the end of the mail, I will rewrite 
<br />
definitions which include my proposals for the sake of clarity.
<br />
Of course these are only proposals and should be discussed and disagreed upon. I especially hope we 
<br />
can discuss the best way to describe the time interval, as 'bounds' might not be the easiest 
<br />
solution to implement in my case.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; eastward_sea_ice_displacement     [m]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has moved over time.
</em><br />
I agree.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The time interval during which the motion took place must be specified 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.
</em><br />
I don't agree. For 2 reasons :
<br />
a) is it the role of the table of standard names to define how a CF file should be formatted? I 
<br />
thought it was the role of the main CF-1.x document?
<br />
b) shouldn't we be less affirmative like:
<br />
&quot;The time interval during which the motion took place must be specified in the file, for example 
<br />
using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.&quot;
<br />
This would be a more flexible definition which could be adapted when/if CF decides on an other 
<br />
standard way of representing time in the future.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A displacement is a vector quantity.  Sea ice displacement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.
</em><br />
I mostly agree. But would like to be more specific:
<br />
&quot;A displacement can be represented as a vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as 
<br />
describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the start point of 
<br />
the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with the 
<br />
displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be
<br />
defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eastward (negative westward).  
</em><br />
OK
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An eastward displacement is the distance across the earth's surface calculated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the change in a moving object's longitude 
</em><br />
OK
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the interval given in the time bounds variable.
</em><br />
Not OK. For the same reasons as above. A &quot;time bounds variable&quot; might not be the best and only way 
<br />
to give the information. Besides the 'during' might be interpreted as 'describing a motion 
<br />
occurring' (its trajectory) which is not what we want. I agree more with the sentence you used for 
<br />
the x_displacement. I thus propose:
<br />
&quot;[from the change in a moving object's longitude] between the start and end of the time interval 
<br />
associated
<br />
with the displacement variable.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; northward_sea_ice_displacement    [m]
</em><br />
See above for introducing sentences.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; northward (negative southward).  A northward displacement is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distance across the earth's surface calculated from the change in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moving object's latitude 
</em><br />
OK
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the interval given in the time bounds variable.
</em><br />
Not ok, same as above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea_ice_x_displacement            [m]
</em><br />
see above for introducing sentences.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;x&quot; indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, when this is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true longitude, positive with increasing x.  
</em><br />
I do not really get this 'when this is not true longitude'. I see what it means (that the 'x' 
<br />
component is actually the 'eastward' component on a 
<br />
lat/lon-earth-mapping-whose-north-is-upward-and-east-is-towards-right) but am not sure we need to 
<br />
keep this. Does it mean I should not use a sea_ice_x_displacement when I am on the above cited earth 
<br />
mapping? That would not be fair. I would write:
<br />
&quot;'x' indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis positive with increasing x.&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An x displacement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculated from the difference in the moving object's grid x coordinate
</em><br />
OK
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the start and end of the interval given in the time bounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable.
</em><br />
not OK, same as above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea_ice_y_displacement            [m]
</em><br />
see above for introducing sentences.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;y&quot; indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis,
</em><br />
should be y-axis here (as already noted by Philip Cameron-Smith)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when this is not true longitude,
</em><br />
should not it be 'latitude' here? but I would anyway propose to remove this sentence altogether
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; positive with increasing y.  A y displacement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculated from the difference in the moving object's grid y coordinate
</em><br />
OK.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the start and end of the interval given in the time bounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable.
</em><br />
not OK, same as above.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea_ice_displacement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has moved over time.  The time interval during which the motion took
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place must be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable. The displacement is the distance across the earth's surface
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculated from the change in a moving object's (lon,lat) position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the start and end of the interval given in the time bounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable.  A displacement is a vector quantity.  Sea ice displacement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.
</em><br />
There might have been a mis-understanding here. This might be the proof that the standard name is 
<br />
not good enough :-). I wanted to use 'sea_ice_displacement' to express the length of the vector 
<br />
(unit [m]), just like sea_ice_velocity expresses the magnitude of the speed (unit [m/s]). So it 
<br />
would read:
<br />
sea_ice_displacement [m]
<br />
[The introcuding sentences]
<br />
In that case, &quot;displacement&quot; is also the distance across the earth's surface calculated from the 
<br />
change in a moving object's (lon,lat) position between the start and end of the time interval associated
<br />
with the displacement variable.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction_of_sea_ice_displacement [degrees]
</em><br />
[introducing sentences].
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;direction_of_X&quot; means direction of a vector, a bearing.  The 'direction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of displacement' is the angle between due north and the displacement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vector.
</em><br />
<br /><br />REWRITING THE DEFINITIONS :
<br />
eastward_sea_ice_displacement     [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that has moved over time.
<br />
The time interval during which the motion took place must be specified in the file, for example 
<br />
using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable. A displacement can be represented as a 
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed 
<br />
motion but merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is found at the tip of the 
<br />
vector after the time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement does not 
<br />
prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no 
<br />
vertical component.
<br />
&quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative 
<br />
westward). An eastward displacement is the distance across the earth's surface calculated
<br />
from the change in a moving object's longitude between the start and end of the time interval 
<br />
associated with the displacement variable.

<br />
&quot;x&quot; indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x.
<br />
An x displacement is calculated from the difference in the moving object's grid

The time interval during which the motion took place must be specified in the file, for example 
<br />
using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable. A displacement can be represented as a 
<br />

prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no 
<br />

<br />
&quot;y&quot; indicates a vector component along the grid y-axis, positive with increasing y.  A y 
<br />
displacement is calculated from the difference in the moving object's grid y coordinate between the
