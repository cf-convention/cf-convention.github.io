Dear Thomas,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I am mostly happy with those definitions and am absolutely ok
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to wait until next release
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (January 09) before having those names in the standard table. It will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give me the opportunity to 1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work on those definitions with the CF list and 2) work on those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitions with my satellite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ice-drift colleagues which (I guess) are not participating to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list? (that's a call :-) )
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for looking at the definitions.  I am happy to iterate them on
<br />
the list and if you could also get some input from your own scientific
<br />
community that would be great.  Please see below for my comments on the
<br />
definitions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As each of your definition is more or less based on the same scheme, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will try to analyse/comment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first definition and then refer to it for the others. At the end
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mail, I will rewrite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitions which include my proposals for the sake of clarity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course these are only proposals and should be discussed and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagreed upon. I especially hope we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can discuss the best way to describe the time interval, as 'bounds'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might not be the easiest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solution to implement in my case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; eastward_sea_ice_displacement     [m]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has moved over time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The time interval during which the motion took place must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't agree. For 2 reasons :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) is it the role of the table of standard names to define how a CF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; file should be formatted? I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought it was the role of the main CF-1.x document?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) shouldn't we be less affirmative like:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The time interval during which the motion took place must be
</em><br />
specified
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the file, for example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would be a more flexible definition which could be adapted
</em><br />
when/if
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CF decides on an other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard way of representing time in the future.
</em><br />
<br />To take your two points in order:
<br />
<br />a) The purpose of including the text about the bounds variable is to
<br />
provide a 'handy hint' for data providers and users on how to use these
<br />
standard names in conjunction with other CF attributes to obtain a
<br />
complete description of the data.  This is not an uncommon thing to do
<br />
in the standard name table because often the standard name on its own
<br />
does not completely describe the data.  For example, the definition of
<br />
the standard name
<br />
change_over_time_in_atmospheric_water_content_due_to_advection reads:
<br />
&quot;The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process
<br />
means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which
<br />
together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.
<br />
'change_over_time_in_X' means change in a quantity X over a
<br />
time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time
<br />
coordinate. 'Content' indicates a quantity per unit area. 'Water' means
<br />
water in all phases.&quot;
<br />
If you were trying to work with real data 'change_over_time' would be
<br />
difficult to interpret unless you also knew the time interval involved.
<br />
If I have understood your names correctly I think the same would be true
<br />
for 'displacement' so there is a need to include the text about time
<br />
bounds.
<br />
<br />b) At present I think the only way in the CF conventions of describing
<br />
the start and end of a time interval is to use a bounds variable for the
<br />
time axis.  (I hope someone will correct me if I am wrong).  It is one
<br />
of the fundamental philosophies of CF development that the conventions
<br />
are only modified in response to current needs, rather than trying to
<br />
foresee all possible future requirements.  (The same is true of standard
<br />
names - we don't add them unless somebody has an actual need for them).
<br />
If the CF conventions on specifying time intervals were to be modified
<br />
in future we would need also to modify that part of all the standard
<br />
name definitions which explains how to specify the time interval.
<br />
<br />I note that you say that 'bounds' may not be the easiest solution for
<br />
you to implement.  Please could you explain a bit more about why this
<br />
is?  If your start and end times are not clearly defined then perhaps we
<br />
could cope with that using the cell_methods attribute applied to a
<br />
standard_name of time, rather than to the time coordinate variable
<br />
itself.  I realise that my last sentence may seem rather cryptic -
<br />
please see section 7.3 of the conventions, particularly the text
<br />
immediately following example 7.5 for a fuller explanation.
<br />
<br />I think we could soften my original text by inserting 'if possible', and
<br />
taking into account your later comment about the use of 'during', I now
<br />
suggest: &quot;If possible, the time interval over which the motion took
<br />
place should be specified using a bounds variable for the time
<br />
coordinate variable.&quot; Does that sound better?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A displacement is a vector quantity.  Sea ice displacement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mostly agree. But would like to be more specific:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;A displacement can be represented as a vector. Such a vector should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however not be interpreted as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indication that the start point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the time interval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associated with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a
</em><br />
trajectory.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sea ice displacement can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />That sounds good to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; eastward (negative westward).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; An eastward displacement is the distance across the earth's surface
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from the change in a moving object's longitude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; during the interval given in the time bounds variable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not OK. For the same reasons as above. A &quot;time bounds variable&quot; might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be the best and only way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to give the information. Besides the 'during' might be interpreted as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'describing a motion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurring' (its trajectory) which is not what we want. I agree more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the sentence you used for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the x_displacement. I thus propose:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;[from the change in a moving object's longitude] between the start
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; end of the time interval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the displacement variable.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I have already explained why I think we need to refer to the bounds
<br />
variable at some point in the definition.  However, in this instance I
<br />
think your wording works just as well as mine and I take your point
<br />
about the use of 'during'.  I'm happy to use your wording here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; northward_sea_ice_displacement    [m]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See above for introducing sentences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; northward (negative southward).  A northward displacement is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distance across the earth's surface calculated from the change in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moving object's latitude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; during the interval given in the time bounds variable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not ok, same as above.
</em><br />
<br />My comments are the same as for eastward_sea_ice_displacement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sea_ice_x_displacement            [m]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see above for introducing sentences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;x&quot; indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, when this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; true longitude, positive with increasing x.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not really get this 'when this is not true longitude'. I see what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it means (that the 'x'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; component is actually the 'eastward' component on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lat/lon-earth-mapping-whose-north-is-upward-and-east-is-towards-right)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but am not sure we need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep this. Does it mean I should not use a sea_ice_x_displacement when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am on the above cited earth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mapping? That would not be fair. I would write:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;'x' indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis positive with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasing x.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />The 'when this is not true longitude' phrase appears in all standard
<br />
name definitions referring to x_components.  See, for example, the
<br />
definition of the standard name projection_x_coordinate: &quot; 'x' indicates
<br />
a vector component along the grid x-axis, when this is not true
<br />
longitude, positive with increasing x. Projection coordinates are
<br />
distances in the x- and y-directions on a plane onto which the surface
<br />
of the Earth has been projected according to a map projection. The
<br />
relationship between the projection coordinates and latitude and
<br />
longitude is described by the grid_mapping.&quot;  Corresponding names and
<br />
definitions exist for y_components.
<br />
<br />In CF, if the horizontal coordinates of the data are true longitude and
<br />
latitude (i.e., lines of longitude converge at the earth's geographical
<br />
poles and lines of latitude are orthogonal to that) then it is
<br />
appropriate to use eastward|northward standard names to refer to
<br />
components of motion.  If, however, your data are on a rotated pole grid
<br />
or a planar map projection you should use x|y standard names.  Does this
<br />
answer your question? Section 5.6 of the conventions document
<br />
&quot;Horizontal Coordinate Reference Systems, Grid Mappings, and
<br />
Projections&quot; gives more information.
<br />
<br />I would prefer that we keep this sentence as it is in view of the
<br />
distinction that CF makes between (lon,lat) and (x,y) coordinates.  Also
<br />
for consistency with other standard name definitions.  Do you agree?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; An x displacement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; calculated from the difference in the moving object's grid x
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordinate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between the start and end of the interval given in the time bounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; variable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not OK, same as above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sea_ice_y_displacement            [m]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see above for introducing sentences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;y&quot; indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be y-axis here (as already noted by Philip Cameron-Smith)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; when this is not true longitude,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should not it be 'latitude' here? but I would anyway propose to remove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this sentence altogether
</em><br />
<br />As above, I would prefer to keep the sentence.  You and Philip are both
<br />
correct - I meant y-axis and latitude.  Copy-and-paste isn't always a
<br />
good thing!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; positive with increasing y.  A y displacement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; calculated from the difference in the moving object's grid y
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordinate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between the start and end of the interval given in the time bounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; variable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not OK, same as above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sea_ice_displacement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has moved over time.  The time interval during which the motion took
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; place must be specified using a bounds variable for the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordinate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; variable. The displacement is the distance across the earth's
</em><br />
surface
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; calculated from the change in a moving object's (lon,lat) position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between the start and end of the interval given in the time bounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; variable.  A displacement is a vector quantity.  Sea ice
</em><br />
displacement
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There might have been a mis-understanding here. This might be the
</em><br />
proof
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the standard name is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not good enough :-). I wanted to use 'sea_ice_displacement' to express
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the length of the vector
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (unit [m]), just like sea_ice_velocity expresses the magnitude of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speed (unit [m/s]). So it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would read:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea_ice_displacement [m]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [The introcuding sentences]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that case, &quot;displacement&quot; is also the distance across the earth's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface calculated from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change in a moving object's (lon,lat) position between the start and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; end of the time interval associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the displacement variable.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />OK.  I think I had understood the name correctly, but perhaps I hadn't
<br />
conveyed it well enough!  I am happy with your wording.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; direction_of_sea_ice_displacement [degrees]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [introducing sentences].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;direction_of_X&quot; means direction of a vector, a bearing.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'direction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of displacement' is the angle between due north and the displacement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; vector.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />So now the full definitions would read as follows:
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_ice_displacement     [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time. If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a
<br />
rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the
<br />
start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the
<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;Eastward&quot;
<br />
indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward
<br />
(negative westward). An eastward displacement is the distance across the
<br />
earth's surface calculated from the change in a moving object's
<br />
longitude between the start and end of the time interval associated with
<br />
the displacement variable.
<br />
<br />northward_sea_ice_displacement    [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a
<br />
rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the
<br />
start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the
<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;Northward&quot;
<br />
indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward
<br />
(negative southward).  A northward displacement is the distance across
<br />
the earth's surface calculated from the change in a moving object's
<br />
latitude between the start and end of the time interval associated with
<br />
the displacement variable.
<br />
<br />sea_ice_x_displacement            [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />

<br />

<br />
start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the
<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;x&quot; indicates a
<br />
vector component along the grid x-axis, when this is not true longitude,
<br />
positive with increasing x.  An x displacement is calculated from the
<br />
difference in the moving object's grid x coordinate between the start
<br />
and end of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.
<br />

<br />
sea_ice_y_displacement            [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a

<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component. &quot;y&quot; indicates a
<br />
vector component along the grid y-axis, when this is not true latitude,
<br />
positive with increasing y.  A y displacement is calculated from the
<br />
difference in the moving object's grid y coordinate between the start
<br />
and end of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.
<br />
<br />sea_ice_displacement [m]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />

<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  In that case,
<br />
&quot;displacement&quot; is also the distance across the earth's surface
<br />
calculated from the change in a moving object's geospatial position
<br />
between the start and end of the time interval associated with the
<br />
displacement variable.
<br />

<br />
direction_of_sea_ice_displacement [degrees]
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a

<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;direction_of_X&quot;
<br />
means direction of a vector, a bearing.  The
<br />
'direction of displacement' is the angle between due north and the
<br />
displacement vector.
