Dear Jonathan, Philip, Martin and Christiane,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (water vapour)/(dry air) Both specific_humidity and

humidity_mixing_ratio are
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard names at present and I propose we keep them. For other X we
</em><br />
could use
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
The above names and definitions are indeed those currently used in the
<br />
standard name table.  In both cases the definitions in the table make
<br />
clear whether the ratio is calculated relative to moist or dry air.
<br />
<br />Both humidity_mixing_ratio and specific_humidity are terms I am used to
<br />
using in meteorology, but the question seems to be whether
<br />
humidity_mixing_ratio is a confusing name for atmospheric chemists.
<br />
Martin has indicated that he would prefer a single naming convention for
<br />
all chemical quantities, Philip has previously said that he prefers
<br />
mass_fraction_of_water_vapor_in_dry_air and Christiane has queried the
<br />
definition of &quot;mixing ratio&quot;.  Heinke, whose proposal began this
<br />
conversation, was happy with water_vapor_mixing_ratio but did not easily
<br />
discover the term humidity_mixing_ratio.  Judging by the discussion so
<br />
far I would say that humidity_mixing_ratio is not the ideal choice of
<br />
name - it could perhaps be regarded as meteorological jargon - so I
<br />
think we should consider the possible alternatives.
<br />
<br />Philip asked the question:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we do choose humidity_mixing_ratio, would it make sense to create
</em><br />
an alias
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from mass_fraction_of_water_vapor_in_dry_air, so as to guide chemists
</em><br />
to the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'special case'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Unfortunately, it would not be possible to do this because aliases in CF
<br />
are used only as a way of recording previous versions of existing
<br />
standard names, for example, when a name is changed for reasons of
<br />
clarity or to correct a spelling mistake.  It is not intended to be used
<br />
as a means of creating synonyms between current names or as a navigation
<br />
aid to the standard name table.  If we changed the name to
<br />
mass_fraction_of_water_vapor_in_dry_air then humidity_mixing_ratio would
<br />
become its alias, but we couldn't do it the other way round.
<br />
<br />In an earlier posting Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that your definition is exactly what humidity mixing ratio
</em><br />
means.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's a more explicit statement of what it means:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  mass_ratio_of_water_vapor_to_dry_air_in_air
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I'm not sure that Jonathan was actually putting this forward as a
<br />
proposal but I think it's worthy of serious consideration.  It states
<br />
clearly what is being calculated (mass_ratio) and the two 'species'
<br />
involved (water_vapor and dry_air).  This wording makes clear that the
<br />
species in the numerator is not also being counted in the denominator
<br />
and thus gets round the &quot;water vapour in dry air/fat in fat-free
<br />
yoghurt&quot; problem.  In practice, I don't think we would need the 'in_air'
<br />
because I think it's highly unlikely that we will ever have to contend
<br />
with names such as mass_ratio_of_water_vapor_to_dry_air_in_sea_water
<br />
(but I'm prepared to be corrected on that point!) Also, the existing
<br />
humidity_mixing_ratio name doesn't say that it is 'in_air' - that is
<br />
just assumed.  Thus, I now suggest that we rename humidity_mixing_ratio
<br />
to mass_ratio_of_water_vapor_to_dry_air.  This will have consequences
<br />
for other names which I describe below.
<br />
<br />If we adopt mass_ratio_of_water_vapor_to_dry_air as a name then for
<br />
consistency we should change the existing mass_fraction_of_X_in_air
<br />
names to also read mass_ratio_of_X_to_Y.  This would also give us the
<br />
opportunity to change Y to be either 'dry_air' or 'ambient_air' as
<br />
appropriate, or retain it as simply 'air' in cases where we want to be
<br />
vague or where the mass of water vapour is considered unimportant.
<br />
Martin's and Christiane's postings in this thread have convinced me that
<br />
the additional clarity of being able to state dry|ambient air is
<br />
desirable.  Apparently, many chemists would assume dry air while
<br />
personally it would not have occurred to me to assume anything other
<br />
than ambient air unless told otherwise.  Currently neither the names nor
<br />
the definitions clarify this point.
<br />
<br />I hope these suggestions are an acceptable compromise between the needs
<br />
to: (a) have a consistent chemical naming convention; (b) avoid
<br />
confusion about which masses/species are included in the numerator and
<br />
denominator of the calculation.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
