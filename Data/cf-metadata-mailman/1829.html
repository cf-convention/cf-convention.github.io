Dear John
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We'd like to come up with a clear statement of what standard names are (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be), and what are the problems and issues that we should be focusing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on next.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for this posting. We've had several discussions about what standard
<br />
names are for and how they are constructed, and I've found those discussions
<br />
helpful to clarify ideas. This is what I currently think (partly repeating
<br />
bits of recent postings):
<br />
<br />* Standard names are not really &quot;names&quot;. They are very brief definitions of
<br />
the quantities concerned, answering the question, &quot;What does that mean?&quot;.
<br />
Therefore they are often longer than the terms used in scientific literature.
<br />
<br />* Standard names are an important element of the purpose of CF, to &quot;define
<br />
metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each
<br />
variable represents ... This enables users of data from different sources to
<br />
decide which quantities are comparable&quot;. Therefore standard names distinguish
<br />
quantities which need to be distinguished, but they can also be deliberately
<br />
vague when quantities from a different data source should share a standard
<br />
name because they are regarded as comparable. Standard names thus have various
<br />
degrees of precision, and the choice of which set of standard names to use
<br />
depends on the application.
<br />
<br />* Like CF in general, the standard name table was initially intended for
<br />
climate and forecast model output, for describing properties of the simulated
<br />
world. The same standard names obviously apply for the same quantities
<br />
measured or inferred in the real world. However for measurements we also have
<br />
to describe (a) &quot;raw&quot; data, which comes from instruments and is used to produce
<br />
data about the real world, and (b) properties of the measurement system. We
<br />
have added some standard names for these purposes, but we may need a clearer
<br />
policy for doing it.
<br />
<br />* It takes time and effort to devise new standard names. Proposals which are
<br />
analogous to existing names can often be agreed quickly. The hard work comes
<br />
in deciding how to describe new concepts in a way which is clear and
<br />
consistent with existing names. This work requires scientific understanding of
<br />
the concepts being described, and thus depends on relevant expertise. In order
<br />
to make this go faster, it might help to have better tools for analysing the
<br />
existing names.
<br />
<br />* We attempt to construct standard names systematically, using words and
<br />
phrases with consistent meanings and in a consistent order. This is to avoid
<br />
implying illusory distinctions, and to reduce mistakes which would be made if
<br />
names differed unexpectedly. Some of the rules are written down in the
<br />
guidelines, but these are not comprehensive. It would probably help speed up
<br />
development if we did state all the rules explicitly. That would make it more
<br />
obvious when a new proposal is like existing ones, and when we have to decide
<br />
on new patterns or vocabulary.
<br />
<br />* The guidelines are not followed in all cases, because for some standard
<br />
names we have adopted familiar but unsystematic terms. Also, there is often
<br />
more than one possible systematic description of a quantity, but obviously
<br />
only one can be chosen for the table.
<br />
<br />* We try to use familiar words and phrases when choosing standard names, but
<br />
it is more important for them to be self-explanatory and to avoid jargon, the
<br />
target audience being any scientific user of the data. The names should at
<br />
least indicate to any such user which general area they refer to.
<br />
<br />* Quantities which have different physical dimensions (different SI units) are
<br />
always regarded as distinct, and must have different standard names. Units
<br />
must be consistent with the standard name; we do not use units to distinguish
<br />
between quantities.
<br />
<br />* Standard names do not provide metadata which could have infinitely many
<br />
possible values. In particular, spatiotemporal coordinates and numerical
<br />
parameters are specified by coordinate variables, not as part of the standard
<br />
name. That means there is not a standard name for 2 m air temperature, for
<br />
example, since CF regards &quot;2 m&quot; as a coordinate. However, surfaces which are
<br />
identified by a physical description rather than a parameter value (e.g. toa)
<br />
are included in standard names, because there is only a small set of
<br />
possibilities.
<br />
<br />* We could use string-valued coordinates for parts of standard names that
<br />
could be regarded as parameters with a discrete set of values, like chemical
<br />
species. We haven't decided to do that yet, but it's a possibility. In that
<br />
approach any combination of parameter and standard name would be allowed,
<br />
whereas when the parameter is part of the standard name (as is the case at
<br />
present with chemical species) the legal combinations are defined explicitly
<br />
by the standard name table. The latter makes more work in constructing the
<br />
standard name table, but avoids nonsensical metadata.
<br />
<br />* Not all the descriptive part of the metadata is included in the standard
<br />
name. Other attributes are also important, such as cell_methods. A separate
<br />
attribute is useful to contain metadata that is relevant for a wide range of
<br />
quantities, because in that case &quot;factorising&quot; it out of the standard name
<br />
leads to a large reduction in the size of the standard name table.
<br />
<br />* Common concepts have been proposed as a way to identify particular
<br />
combinations of standard names with other metadata. They would complement
<br />
standard names, other attributes and coordinates.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
