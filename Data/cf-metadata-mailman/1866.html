<br />
Dear Stephen,
<br />
<br />Please see below for my responses to all the standard names you proposed
<br />
in your document
<br />
<a href="http://www.clivar.org/organization/wgomd/wgomd_publications.php">http://www.clivar.org/organization/wgomd/wgomd_publications.php</a>.  I
<br />
think you will see that for the most part I am happy to accept the names
<br />
as proposed, but I have made a few suggestions for slight modifications
<br />
to some of the names.  I am aware that you want to finalise the names
<br />
for CMIP5 soon and I hope these responses will assist you in doing so.
<br />
<br />For the purpose of commenting on individual names I have labelled your
<br />
proposals as X.Y where X is your table number and Y is the number of the
<br />
entry in the table.  Where a name in one of your tables is already in
<br />
the CF standard name table I have (except in one or two cases) not
<br />
included a comment.
<br />
<br />Table 1.
<br />
1.1 equation of state - This would need underscores instead of spaces,
<br />
thus: equation_of_state.
<br />
1.2 seawater freezing temp - As in 1.1, underscores need to be added.
<br />
'seawater' is divided into two words in existing standard names,  also
<br />
'temp' should be expanded to say 'temperature'.  I think that the name
<br />
sea_water_freezing_temperature sounds as though one might expect to find
<br />
actual temperature values in the varaiable and I wonder if it might be
<br />
better to call it sea_water_freezing_temperature_formula.  What do
<br />
others think?
<br />
<br />Presumably both of these quantities are described by formulae which will
<br />
differ between models.  Your table says that the actual formulae will
<br />
consist of Fortran code.  Is the idea that these 'data' will be placed
<br />
in a character variable something like the following?
<br />
<br />dimensions:
<br />
nlines = 1 ;      // no. of lines of FORTRAN code supplied
<br />
maxlen = 80 ;     // max string length used to supply FORTRAN code
<br />
variables:
<br />
char swft(nlines,maxlen) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swft:standard_name = &quot;sea_water_freezing_temperature_formula&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swft:canonical_units = &quot;1&quot; ;
<br />
data:
<br />
&nbsp;swft  = &quot;TF = -0.0575*S + 0.001710523*SQRT(S**3) - 0.0002154996*S**2 -
<br />
0.00753*p&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
If this is what you intend, then I think the canonical_units in the
<br />
standard name table should be '1', i.e. dimensionless and the definition
<br />
of the standard name would explain that the contents are strings.  This
<br />
is our usual practice for string valued variables.
<br />
<br />1.3 reference_sea_water_density_for_boussinesq_approximation - OK.
<br />
<br />1.5 grid specification (lengths, areas) with units of m and m2.
<br />
I assume here that you are thinking of names such as grid_length and
<br />
grid_area?  We already have a name cell_area with units of m2, defined
<br />
as the horizontal area of a gridcell, which sounds like it is probably
<br />
the quantity you need.  Currently we don't have standard names for other
<br />
grid metrics, but area and volume can be recorded in the cell_measures
<br />
attribute (see Section 7.2 of the CF Conventions).  Regarding
<br />
grid_length, I think this is something that would usually be calculated
<br />
from the cell boundaries given in a bounds variable.  See also my
<br />
comments on proposal 2.11 cell_thickness.
<br />
<br />1.6 region.
<br />
Although your table indicates that this quantity is new to CMIP5, we do
<br />
already have a CF standard name of &quot;region&quot;.  It is a CF recommendation
<br />
that, where possible, variables having this standard name take their
<br />
values from the standardized list of region names at
<br />
<a href="http://www.cfconventions.org/documents/cf-standard-names/standardized-re">http://www.cfconventions.org/documents/cf-standard-names/standardized-re</a>
<br />
gion-names. 
<br />
<br />Table 2.
<br />
2.1 sea_water_mass; kg - OK.  
<br />
<br />2.2 sea_water_pressure_at_sea_floor; Pa - The name is fine.  I note that
<br />
we already have the name sea_water_pressure in the standard name table
<br />
and that this quantity has a canonical_unit of dbar.  Clearly the units
<br />
can be converted, but I think that we should aim for consistent
<br />
canonical_units for these two names.  Does it make more sense to use
<br />
dbar or Pa?
<br />
<br />2.3 sea_water_pressure_at_sea_water_surface; Pa. I appreciate that this
<br />
is a different quantity to surface_air_pressure and therefore we need a
<br />
new name.  However, do we need to say sea_water_surface or would it
<br />
suffice to say surface_sea_water_pressure?  ('Surface' is defined in
<br />
standard names to mean the lower boundary of the atmosphere which
<br />
therefore would also be the upper boundary of the ocean).
<br />
<br />2.4 sea_water_volume; m3 - OK.
<br />
<br />2.6 square_of_sea_surface_height_above_geoid; m2. OK.
<br />
<br />2.8 global_average_steric_sea_level_change; m. OK.  We already have the
<br />
names global_average_sea_level_change and
<br />
global_average_thermosteric_sea_level_change and this new proposal is
<br />
consistent.  Am I correct in thinking that steric sea level change is
<br />
the sum of thermosteric and halosteric contributions to changes in sea
<br />
water density?
<br />
<br />2.10 cell_mass_per_area; kg m-2.  Does this mean the mass per unit area
<br />
of the sea water contained within each grid cell?  If so, I suggest the
<br />
name should be mass_of_sea_water_per_unit_area which would be similar to
<br />
the existing name atmosphere_mass_of_air_per_unit_area.
<br />
<br />2.11 cell_thickness; m.  See also my comments on proposal 1.5 &quot;grid
<br />
specification&quot;.  Cell_thickness would usually be calculated from the
<br />
bounds on the vertical coordinate variable.  Names such as cell_length
<br />
and cell_thickness have been discussed on the mailing list in the past
<br />
and have received equivocal support.  See, for example, the conversation
<br />
we had in 2006 on cell_metrics in
<br />
<a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2006/001068.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2006/001068.html</a> and
<br />
following messages.  I note that both Ian Culverwell and Jonathan seem
<br />
to support the idea of introducing cell_thickness as a new quantity in
<br />
the cell_measure attribute.  I too think that would be  a sensible
<br />
approach rather than introducing it as a new standard name. This will
<br />
require a proposal for a small modification to the CF conventions which
<br />
needs to be opened as a new ticket on the CF trac system.  I will submit
<br />
a proposal to the trac system to take this forward as there is clearly a
<br />
demand for somewhere convenient to access this type of grid metric
<br />
information.
<br />
<br />2.13 sea_surface_temperature; K.  This quantity is already in the
<br />
standard name table.  For information, I would like to point out that we
<br />
have recently introduced the following standard names for related
<br />
quantities: sea_surface_skin_temperature,
<br />
sea_surface_subskin_temperature, sea_surface_foundation_temperature.  I
<br />
am drawing attention to the existence of these names in case they are
<br />
relevant to the CMIP5 work.
<br />
<br />2.14 square_of_sea_surface_temperature; K2. OK.
<br />
<br />2.17 sea_water_age_since_surface_contact; year.  The name sounds fine.
<br />
I think the canonical_units in the standard name table should probably
<br />
be seconds, rather than years because of the way UDunits defines a year.
<br />
For more information on this please see Section 4.4 of the CF
<br />
Conventions.
<br />
<br />2.18 moles_of_cfc11_per_unit_mass_in_sea_water; mol kg-1.  I would
<br />
slightly re-order this name to read
<br />
moles_per_unit_mass_of_cfc11_in_sea_water so that its syntax is more
<br />
consistent with existing mole_fraction and mole_concentration standard
<br />
names.  I think moles_per_unit_mass with units of mol kg-1 is fine.
<br />
'mole_fraction' implies units of mol mol-1 (i.e. dimensionless) and
<br />
'mole_concentration' means the units are mol m-3 so we clearly need a
<br />
new description for your units.
<br />
<br />2.19 ocean_barotropic_mass_streamfunction; kg s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />2.21 square_of_ocean_mixed_layer_thickness_defined_by_sigma_t; m2. OK.
<br />
<br />2.22 ocean_mixed_layer_thickness_defined_by_mixing_scheme; m.  I would
<br />
understand this to mean the depth of the mixed layer as calculated by a
<br />
model's own mixing scheme - is that correct?  I think the name is OK.
<br />
<br />Table 3.
<br />
3.3 upward_ocean_mass_transport; kg s-1. OK.  We already have a number
<br />
of ocean salt and heat transport names in the table. I assume the mass
<br />
referred to in this name is that of the sea water including salt.
<br />
Correct?
<br />
<br />3.4 square_of_upward_ocean_mass_transport; kg2 s-2. OK.
<br />
<br />3.5 ocean_mass_x_transport; kg s-1 and 3.6 ocean_mass_y_transport; kg
<br />
s-1. These are consistent with the existing x and y velocity names.  OK.
<br />
<br />3.7 ocean_meridional_overturning_mass_streamfunction; kg s-1.  The name
<br />
is OK.  The description of the existing standard name
<br />
ocean_meridional_overturning_streamfunction says &quot;The ocean meridional
<br />
overturning streamfunction should not include not include &quot;bolus&quot; or
<br />
Gent-McWilliams velocity.&quot;  Presumably the mass streamfunction is
<br />
defined in an analogous way?
<br />
<br />3.8 ocean_y_overturning_mass_streamfunction; kg s-1. OK.  Presumably
<br />
this also excludes bolus and Gent-McWilliams contributions?
<br />
<br />3.9
<br />
ocean_meridional_overturning_mass_streamfunction_due_to_bolus_advection;
<br />
kg s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />3.10 ocean_y_overturning_mass_streamfunction_due_to_bolus_advection; kg
<br />
s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />3.14 ocean_heat_x_transport; W and 3.15 ocean_heat_y_transport; W.  Both
<br />
OK.
<br />
<br />3.16 ocean_heat_x_transport_due_to_bolus_advection; W and 3.18
<br />
ocean_heat_y_transport_due_to_bolus_advection; W. Both OK.
<br />
<br />3.17 ocean_heat_x_transport_due_to_diffusion; W and 3.19
<br />
ocean_heat_y_transport_due_to_diffusion; W.  Both OK.
<br />
<br />Table 4.
<br />
As I mentioned earlier, CF does have a defined set of standardized
<br />
region names whose use is described in Section 6.1 of the conventions
<br />
document.  The region names are not, however, standard names in their
<br />
own right and do not appear in the standard name table.  Similarly, your
<br />
region names would not need to become CF standard names.  I note that
<br />
you have defined the extent of your named areas and it may be possible
<br />
to add them to the standardized list at a later date.
<br />
<br />Table 5.
<br />
The majority of names in table 5 are already in the standard name table.
<br />
Only two are new proposals.
<br />
<br />5.5 water_flux_into_sea_water_from_icebergs; kg m-2 s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />5.6 water_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_sea_ice_thermodynamics; kg m-2 s-1.
<br />
We have recently introduced the standard name
<br />
water_flux_out_of_sea_water_due_to_sea_ice_thermodynamics which has the
<br />
opposite sign convention to your name.  However, I see no problem in
<br />
also introducing your name as its meaning is clear and we do already
<br />
have a similar pair of names: water_flux_into_sea_water and
<br />
water_flux_out_of_sea_water. OK.
<br />
<br />Table 6. 
<br />
6.1 virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_rainfall; kg m-2 s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />6.2 virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_evaporation; kg m-2 s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />6.3 virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_rivers; kg m-2 s-1. I
<br />
suggest that we amend this name slightly to read
<br />
virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_from_rivers because in standard names
<br />
we reserve the phrase 'due to' to refer to a physical process as in the
<br />
previous two names, for example.  'from_rivers' is also more consistent
<br />
with the water flux names.
<br />
<br />6.4 virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_sea_ice_thermodynamics; kg
<br />
m-2 s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />6.6 virtual_salt_flux_correction; kg m-2 s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />6.8 salt_flux_from_rivers_into_sea_water; kg m-2 s-1.  I suggest that
<br />
this name should be re-ordered to read
<br />
salt_flux_into_sea_water_from_rivers for consistency with the water flux
<br />
names.
<br />
<br />Table 7.
<br />
7.1 upward_geothermal_heat_flux_at_sea_floor; W m-2. OK
<br />
<br />7.2 rainfall_temperature_flux_expressed_as_heat_flux; W m-2.
<br />
7.3 evaporation_temperature_flux_expressed_as_heat_flux; W m-2.
<br />
7.4 temperature_flux_into_sea_water_from_runoff_expressed_as_heat_flux;
<br />
W m-2.
<br />
I have thought hard about these three names because initially I wasn't
<br />
very keen on the use of 'temperature flux' but having studied the
<br />
definitions in section 4.5.3 of your document I can see what you mean
<br />
and I can't think of an obvious improvement.  To make the three names
<br />
more consistent with one another and with existing names I would suggest
<br />
a slight rewording as follows:
<br />
7.2
<br />
temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water;
<br />
W m-2;
<br />
7.3
<br />
temperature_flux_due_to_evaporation_expressed_as_heat_flux_out_of_sea_wa
<br />
ter; W m-2;
<br />
7.4
<br />
temperature_flux_due_to_runoff_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water; W
<br />
m-2.
<br />
These are a bit longer than the original proposals but they all now
<br />
follow the same pattern and it is clear in which direction the flux is
<br />
positive.
<br />
<br />7.5 heat_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_sea_ice_thermodynamics; W m-2. OK.
<br />
<br />7.6 heat_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_icebergs; W m-2.  Is this quantity
<br />
analogous to 7.5, i.e. would it be better to say
<br />
heat_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_iceberg_thermodynamics?
<br />
<br />7.11 downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_sea_water; W m-2. OK.
<br />
<br />Table 8.
<br />
Please note that the canonical units for the quantities listed in table
<br />
8 would appear in the standard name table as Pascals, which is exactly
<br />
equivalent to N m-2.
<br />
<br />8.3 surface_downward_x_stress_correction; Pa and 8.4
<br />
surface_downward_y_stress_correction; Pa. Both OK.
<br />
<br />Table 9.
<br />
9.3 ocean_vertical_tracer_diffusivity_due_to_background; m2 s-1. OK.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From your document I understand 'due_to_background' to mean a static
</em><br />
imposed field which may be either a constant value over the globe or
<br />
spatially varying, depending on the model used.  Is that the correct
<br />
interpretation?
<br />
<br />9.4 ocean_vertical_tracer_diffusivity_due_to_tides; m2 s-1. OK. 
<br />
<br />9.5 tendency_of_ocean_potential_energy_content; W m-2. OK.
<br />
<br />9.6 tendency_of_ocean_potential_energy_content_due_to_tides; W m-2. OK.
<br />
I am aware that distinctions can be made between a number of different
<br />
ocean tides and indeed we have recently introduced standard names for
<br />
sea surface heights due to various tidal components.  Please could you
<br />
supply a sentence or two that can be included in the definitions of
<br />
'due_to_tides' names so that it is clear which processes are
<br />
included/excluded.
<br />
<br />9.7 tendency_of_ocean_potential_energy_content_due_to_background; W m-2.
<br />
OK.
<br />
<br />9.9 ocean_vertical_momentum_diffusivity_due_to_background; m2 s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />9.10 ocean_vertical_momentum_diffusivity_due_to_tides; m2 s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />9.11 ocean_vertical_momentum_diffusivity_due_to_form_drag; m2 s-1. OK.
<br />
<br />9.12
<br />
ocean_kinetic_energy_dissipation_per_unit_area_due_to_vertical_friction;
<br />
W m-2. OK.
<br />
<br />Table 10.
<br />
While I will not pretend to have a detailed understanding of ocean
<br />
diffusivity parametrization schemes I can see that all these names are
<br />
composed on a common pattern and using standard and well defined terms.
<br />
I note that there was some discussion of whether to use 'laplacian' in
<br />
the lateral diffusivities and that it was concluded that the term is
<br />
acceptable in these names. Therefore I am happy to accept all the names
<br />
in table 10 as proposed.
<br />
<br />10.1 ocean_tracer_bolus_laplacian_diffusivity; m2 s-1.
<br />
<br />10.2 ocean_tracer_bolus_biharmonic_diffusivity; m4 s-1.
<br />
<br />10.3 ocean_tracer_epineutral_laplacian_diffusivity; m2 s-1.
<br />
<br />10.4 ocean_tracer_epineutral_biharmonic_diffusivity; m4 s-1.
<br />
<br />10.5 ocean_tracer_xy_laplacian_diffusivity; m2 s-1.
<br />
<br />10.6 ocean_tracer_xy_biharmonic_diffusivity; m4 s-1.
<br />
<br />10.7
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_eddy_kinetic_energy_content_due_to_bolus_transport; W
<br />
m-2.
<br />
<br />10.8 ocean_momentum_xy_laplacian_diffusivity; m2 s-1.
<br />
<br />10.9 ocean_ momentum_xy_biharmonic_diffusivity; m4 s-1.
<br />
<br />10.10 ocean_kinetic_energy_dissipation_per_unit_area_due_to_xy_friction;
<br />
W m-2.
