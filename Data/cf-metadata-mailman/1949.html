<br />
Dear All,
<br />
<br />Over recent weeks there has been a large number of proposals for new
<br />
standard names.  To help keep track of them all I have prepared a brief
<br />
summary of the currently open standard names discussion threads.  The
<br />
proposals are listed in date order (oldest first).  If any set of
<br />
proposals has been missed from this list please let me know and it will
<br />
be added.
<br />
<br />The next update of the standard name table will take place on 10 March.
<br />
This will definitely go ahead as there are agreed names waiting for
<br />
inclusion.  A complete list of the new names and other planned
<br />
modifications to the table will be published in advance of the update.
<br />
<br />I have recently been concentrating on the various sets of ocean related
<br />
proposals, the majority of which are now agreed.  The oldest, and by far
<br />
the largest, of the remaining threads is that relating to the set of
<br />
chemical names originally proposed by Martina Stockhause.  I would like
<br />
to take the same approach with the chemistry names as I have with the
<br />
ocean names, i.e. review several threads in tandem, as this helps to
<br />
keep track of any issues affecting more than one set of names.  Most
<br />
recently, various sets of names have been proposed relating to the CMIP5
<br />
work and these need to be addressed on a relatively short timescale.
<br />
Therefore, over the next few weeks I will be dividing my time mainly
<br />
between the chemistry names and the various CMIP5 threads.
<br />
<br />As there is currently much activity in the area of standard names I will
<br />
publish another summary status report in two weeks time to give an
<br />
update on the situation.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
