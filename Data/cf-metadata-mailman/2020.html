<br />
Dear Martina and all those who have contributed to the lively discussion
<br />
in this thread,
<br />
<br />Thanks all for your discussion of these names and thanks to Martina for
<br />
her summary of the current state of agreements reached.  Thanks also for
<br />
your patience while I have been working my way through this quite
<br />
complicated discussion!
<br />
<br />1. Regarding the physical quantities in Martina's original proposal, I
<br />
think many of the outstanding issues have been resolved.  The following
<br />
is a summary of the situation:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; column_integrated_mass_density_of_X_in_air  : kg.m-2
</em><br />
It has been agreed that the existing syntax of
<br />
atmosphere_mass_content_of_X (kg m-2) will be used for these names.
<br />
This is also consistent with some newly accepted names in the
<br />
ECHAM5-Hammoz discussion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_X_due_to_respiration :
</em><br />
kg.m-2.s-1
<br />
Early in the discussion Jonathan asked whether 'respiration' should
<br />
specify heterotrophic, plant or soil as in existing respiration names,
<br />
or whether your names represent the total.  I'm not sure that this point
<br />
was answered - Martina, please can you confirm which is the correct
<br />
definition?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_X_due_to_chemical_gross_production :
</em><br />
mol.m-3.s-1
<br />
This has been agreed with the addition of 'in_air' as follows:
<br />
tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_X_in_air_due_to_chemical_gross_product
<br />
ion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_X_due_to_chemical_gross_destruction
</em><br />
: mol.m-3.s-1
<br />
This has been agreed with the addition of 'in_air' as follows:
<br />
tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_X_in_air_due_to_chemical_gross_destruc
<br />
tion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; total_yearly_average_burden_of_X_in_atmosphere : mol
</em><br />
It was agreed that the existing moles_of_X_in_atmosphere (mol) syntax,
<br />
used in conjunction with a cell_methods attribute on the time axis,
<br />
would describe this quantity.  In the &quot;medium 'atmosphere'&quot; thread it
<br />
has been agreed to rearrange the order of the terms in the existing
<br />
names, so the correct syntax will in fact be atmosphere_moles_of_X.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; total_yearly_averaged_atmospheric_loss_of_X : mol.s-1
</em><br />
It was agreed that the existing syntax of
<br />
tendency_of_moles_of_X_in_atmosphere (mol s-1), used in conjunction with
<br />
a cell_methods attribute on the time axis, would describe this quantity.
<br />
In the &quot;medium 'atmosphere'&quot; thread it has been agreed to rearrange the
<br />
order of the terms in the existing names, so the correct syntax will in
<br />
fact be tendency_of_atmosphere_moles_of_X.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_area_density_of_X : m-1
</em><br />
It was agreed to modify these names to read density_of_surface_area_of_X
<br />
(m-1).  The definition of the physical quantity is 'the surface area of
<br />
aerosol per unit volume of atmosphere'.
<br />
<br />In addition to the physical quantities listed above, I note that the
<br />
original list of proposed names (attached for ease of reference) also
<br />
contains many names with patterns already in use in the standard name
<br />
table, such as mass_fraction_of_X_in_air,
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_X_due_to_emission, and so on.
<br />
The majority of these are well established and require no further
<br />
discussion but there are two sets of names in the list which are
<br />
affected by discussions in other threads.  The quantities under
<br />
discussion are X_mole_flux (in the 'Modification of some existing CF
<br />
standard names for chemical constituents'/'CF: surface flux versus
<br />
emissions' threads) and atmosphere_optical_thickness (in the
<br />
ECHAM5-hammoz thread).  I think we need to resolve the separate threads
<br />
before reaching a final decision on those particular names.
<br />
<br />Martina's list includes names of tendencies due to the processes
<br />
net_production and net_production_and_emission.  The latter is used in
<br />
two existing standard names while the former is not currently used in
<br />
the table, but I see no problem in including it as a separate process.
<br />
We have now agreed in this thread to add the processes
<br />
chemical_gross_production and chemical_gross_destruction and this
<br />
prompted me to look back at the (lengthy) discussion of chemical names
<br />
we had in 2007 when Christiane proposed net_production for use with the
<br />
HTAP names.  Originally, Christiane proposed to use
<br />
chemical_net_production but the word 'chemical' has been dropped from
<br />
the two names already in the table.  I couldn't find any discussion of
<br />
dropping 'chemical' and I now think this may have happened accidentally
<br />
when I added the names to the table.  I suggest, therefore, that aliases
<br />
should be created for the two existing names to change
<br />
net_production_and_emission to chemical_net_production_and_emission and
<br />
that the word 'chemical' should be added to Martina's 'net_production'
<br />
proposals to make them consistent with the gross production/destruction
<br />
names.  I'd welcome any comments on this, particularly if anyone can
<br />
recall any agreement to drop 'chemical' from the names.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. NEW chemical constituents:
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; atomic_oxygen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nitrate_radical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nitrous_acid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; radon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methyl_peroxy_radical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methanol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ethanol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; butane
</em><br />
<br />These species names have not attracted any comment. They are all
<br />
individual species, clearly defined, and IUPAC names have been used
<br />
where appropriate so I think these are all agreed.
<br />
<br />We already have 5 names in the standard name table that refer simply to
<br />
'oxygen', presumably in its molecular form.  As we will now be
<br />
introducing 'atomic_oxygen' should we create aliases for these older
<br />
names by replacing 'oxygen' with 'molecular_oxygen'?  This would then
<br />
also be consistent with existing and proposed 'molecular_hydrogen'
<br />
names.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; nitric_acid_trihydrate_aerosol
</em><br />
In the discussions under the ECHAM5-Hammoz and 'Modification of some
<br />
existing CF standard names for chemical constituents' threads it has
<br />
been agreed that all aerosol names should specify either 'dry' or
<br />
'ambient' aerosol.  Martina, please could you specify which is correct
<br />
for this species? (The definitions of 'dry' and 'ambient' aerosol are
<br />
given below for reference).
<br />
<br />Dry aerosol: '&quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid particles in
<br />
air (except cloud droplets). Aerosol takes up ambient water (a process
<br />
known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the
<br />
composition of the aerosol. &quot;Dry aerosol&quot; means aerosol without water.'
<br />
<br />Ambient aerosol: '&quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid
<br />
particles in air (except cloud droplets). &quot;Ambient aerosol&quot; is aerosol
<br />
that has taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent
<br />
of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the
<br />
composition of the aerosol.'
<br />
<br />This point about the aerosol names also affects some of the existing
<br />
chemical species that appear in Martina's proposals.  In the
<br />
'Modification of some existing CF standard names for chemical
<br />
constituents' thread it was agreed that all older 'aerosol' standard
<br />
names (which existed before the dry/ambient aerosol distinction was
<br />
introduced) should be made aliases of 'ambient_aerosol' names.  Thus
<br />
mass_fraction names for pm1_aerosol, pm10_aerosol and  pm2p5_aerosol
<br />
will be changed to refer to pm1_ambient_aerosol, etc. The names in
<br />
Martina's proposals should also specify ambient or dry. Is it fair to
<br />
say that these size distribution names will always be 'ambient'?
<br />
<br />Another small point regarding an existing species name:  please note
<br />
that secundary_particulate_organic_matter should read
<br />
secondary_particulate_organic_matter, i.e, there is a typo in
<br />
'secondary'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; formic_acid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aceto_nitrile
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acetic_acid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alpha_pinene
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beta_pinene
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limonene
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hcfc141b
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hcfc142b
</em><br />
<br />None of these are IUPAC names.  Philip has kindly looked up their IUPAC
<br />
equivalents, which are long and complex, and has proposed that CF should
<br />
take a pragmatic approach to using chemical names.  Others have
<br />
expressed strong agreement with this position.  Specifically, it has
<br />
been agreed that IUPAC names should be used where practicable, but it is
<br />
recognised that non-systematic IUPAC approved names, or on occasion
<br />
other common names, will be preferable where these are widely used,
<br />
shorter and unambiguous.  Where non-IUPAC chemical names are used in
<br />
standard names the definition of the name should include the IUPAC
<br />
equivalent.  I think that we have already tried to take this approach
<br />
with chemical names in CF and so it is good if we now have formal
<br />
agreement that this is the way to go.  Following the earlier discussion
<br />
in this thread, these eight chemical names are agreed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; noy_expressed_as_nitrogen : All nitrogen oxides (NOy) expressed as
</em><br />
nitrogen
<br />
The group of species here referred to as noy is already in the standard
<br />
name table using the term 'reactive_nitrogen'.  For example, we have the
<br />
name mole_fraction_of_total_reactive_nitrogen_in_air defined as 'Mole
<br />
fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is
<br />
a material constituent of Y. &quot;Reactive nitrogen&quot;, sometimes referred to
<br />
as Noy, describes a family of chemical species. The family usually
<br />
includes atomic nitrogen (N), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide
<br />
(NO2), dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitric acid (HNO3), peroxynitric
<br />
acid (HNO4), bromine nitrate (BrONO2) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2).'
<br />
There is only one reactive_nitrogen name in the table.  We could choose
<br />
either to create an alias for that one name and change it to use 'noy',
<br />
or we could change Martina's proposals to use the term
<br />
'reactive_nitrogen'.  I have no strong preference for either term and
<br />
would be happy to go with the majority view.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; hox_expressed_as_hydrogen : HOx radical (OH+HO2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total_peroxy_radical : Total inorganic and organic peroxy radicals
</em><br />
(HO2 + RO2)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clox_expressed_as_chlorine : Total inorganic chlorine except HCl,
</em><br />
ClONO2: ClOx
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brox_expressed_as_bromine : Total inorganic bromine except HBr,
</em><br />
BrONO2: BrOx
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nmvoc_expressed_as_carbon : Non-methane volatile organic compounds
</em><br />
expressed 
<br />
as carbon
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anthropogenic_nmvoc_expressed_as_carbon : anthropogenic
</em><br />
nmvoc_expressed_as_carbon
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biogenic_nmvoc_expressed_as_carbon : biogenic
</em><br />
nmvoc_expressed_as_carbon
<br />
<br />'Expressed_as' has been discussed in this thread and also in the
<br />
ECHAM5-Hammoz and &quot;position of 'expressed as' in chemical constituents'
<br />
threads. There is general agreement that 'expressed_as' should appear in
<br />
the standard name directly following the species to which it applies.
<br />
Philip sought clarification of the definition of 'expressed_as'.  It was
<br />
agreed that 'expressed_as_X' means the mass of X (where X is a chemical
<br />
element) contained in a species or group of species, ignoring all other
<br />
chemical elements.  This is the sense in which it has been used in
<br />
existing names.
<br />
<br />Martina provided the following definitions during the discussion:
<br />
'anthropogenic' refers to chemical constituents influenced, caused, or
<br />
created by human activity;
<br />
'biogenic' refers to chemical constituents generated by natural
<br />
processes;
<br />
'oxygenated' means 'containing oxygen'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_alkanes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_alkenes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_aromatic_compounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_terpenes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_oxygenated_hydrocarbons
</em><br />
<br />All the above 'expressed as' and 'lumped' names refer to groups of
<br />
species that are in some sense treated collectively in atmospheric
<br />
chemistry models.  There has been quite a lengthy discussion of these
<br />
names from which the following main points arise:
<br />
a) Martin explained that the extent to which the groups of species are
<br />
defined is variable. For example:
<br />
'HOx radical' is well defined as a combination of just two species
<br />
(OH+HO2);
<br />
'RO2' is a combination of a larger number of species (all organic peroxy
<br />
radicals);
<br />
'nmvoc' (non-methane volatile organic compounds) is not very clearly
<br />
defined (e.g., sometimes it will include alkanes, sometimes not, and
<br />
similarly for alkenes, etc.);
<br />
'lumped' alkanes may mean alkanes with more than 3 carbon atoms, or more
<br />
than 4 carbons, or more than 5, etc.
<br />
b) For the less well defined groups the 'lumping' will vary from model
<br />
to model.
<br />
c) There was discussion of the use of the terms 'lumped' and 'total' in
<br />
standard names.  There are only two names currently in the table that
<br />
use the term 'total' - mole_fraction_of_total_inorganic_bromine_in_air
<br />
and mole_fraction_of_total_reactive_nitrogen_in_air.  There are
<br />
currently no names using 'lumped'.  Jonathan commented that the use of
<br />
'total' is to emphasise the total of mole fractions of all species that
<br />
&quot;qualify&quot; as inorganic bromine, reactive nitrogen, etc.  Martin said
<br />
that the difference between 'lumped' and 'total' is the extent to which
<br />
the group of species is well defined. 'Lumped' groups are deliberately
<br />
vague - they may be defined within a community but they are not well
<br />
enough defined to be used across different communities.  Martin
<br />
recommended that the definitions of 'lumped species' names should state
<br />
that the group is vague.  Philip commented that, notwithstanding the
<br />
difference in concept between 'total' and 'lumped', standard names
<br />
should employ only one term - 'total' - because that would be less
<br />
ambiguous for non-experts, or alternatively we should avoid entirely the
<br />
use of any 'grouping' term.  Jonathan agreed with the latter suggestion.
<br />
If we were to adopt this suggestion, aliases would need to be created
<br />
for the two existing 'total' names.  I.e. they would become
<br />
mole_fraction_of_inorganic_bromine_in_air and
<br />
mole_fraction_of_reactive_nitrogen|noy_in_air.  Additionally, Martina's
<br />
'lumped' species above would become:
<br />
alkanes
<br />
alkenes
<br />
aromatic_compounds
<br />
terpenes
<br />
oxygenated_hydrocarbons
<br />
and total_peroxy_radical would become simply peroxy_radical.
<br />
I would welcome further comments regarding this suggestion.  In
<br />
particular, would the names without 'lumped' be acceptable in the
<br />
context of GRIB2? One last point: I think that, no matter which
<br />
terminology we choose to adopt, the definitions of all group species
<br />
standard names should contain a statement of how precisely or vaguely
<br />
the group is known.
<br />
<br />passive_ozone
<br />
<br />At present, we have not reached a conclusion on this.  As Philip
<br />
explained, a particular species may be passive in some respects, but
<br />
reactive in others.  He gave the example of stratospheric ozone in the
<br />
troposphere.  It is generally agreed that it is useful to have standard
<br />
names for tracers to separate them from fully interactive species.
<br />
However, it is unlikely that all the information regarding the
<br />
circumstances in which a particular species is passive and reactive
<br />
within a particular model could be given in the standard name.  We have
<br />
discussed passive_ozone before and reached a similar point before the
<br />
proposal was withdrawn.  It seems that we will need to make use of other
<br />
attributes besides standard_name if we are to fully describe passive
<br />
tracers.  It would be helpful if we could gather a number of use cases
<br />
in order to assess the information that needs to be described and
<br />
address how to do that within CF metadata.
<br />
<br />I have a couple of questions regarding the relationships between some
<br />
new species in Martina's list and some that already exist in the table:
<br />
<br />hexachlorocyclohexane/alpha_hexachlorocyclohexane:
<br />
<br />We already have names in the table that refer to
<br />
alpha_hexachlorocyclohexane and Martina's proposals include more names
<br />
for that species, plus names that refer simply to
<br />
'hexachlorocyclohexane' (i.e., no isomer specified). Please can you
<br />
confirm whether that was intentional (i.e. I want to check that both
<br />
sets of names are needed and it isn't just a by-product of generating
<br />
the new names with a script).
<br />
<br />ammonium/ammonium_dry_aerosol:
<br />
<br />Again I just wanted to check that these are different species, i.e, are
<br />
there other forms of ammonium in the atmosphere besides dry_aerosol?
<br />
Does ammonium include ammonium_dry_aerosol?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. NEW CF standard names:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The individual CF standard names, resulting from the combination of
</em><br />
physical 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity and chemical constituent or aerosol, are quite many (see
</em><br />
attached 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; file). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I apologize for this long list. My idea to move the name of the
</em><br />
chemical 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constituent or aerosol from the standard name into an attribute was
</em><br />
dismissed 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the scientists. The disadvantage of a CF standard name without the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constituent was larger than the advantage of a smaller number of CF
</em><br />
standard 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; names to be proposed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since I had to use a script for the generation of these individual CF
</em><br />
names, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there might be some names in the list, which doesn't make sense.
</em><br />
Therefore a 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counter-check is necessary and highly appreciated.
</em><br />
<br />There has been considerable discussion of how chemistry standard names
<br />
could be generated in future, particularly where several thousand
<br />
chemical species may be involved.  There are also other ongoing
<br />
discussions regarding the design and 'grammar' of standard names.
<br />
Within this thread, it was agreed that we should not introduce
<br />
'nonsense' standard names, i.e., we should not automatically include
<br />
names resulting from the combination of every chemical species with
<br />
every possible physical process.  Personally, I support this position
<br />
very strongly.  We expend considerable effort in CF agreeing not only
<br />
the names themselves, but also their definitions.  I think that this
<br />
work on agreeing meaningful concepts would be greatly undermined if we
<br />
were to begin including names for quantities that cannot exist.  Another
<br />
reason for not automatically including all combinations is that it may
<br />
on occasion lead to the duplication of quantities that already exist in
<br />
the table by another name.  For example, the first name in Martina's
<br />
list is mass_concentration_of_air; kg m-3, but this is already in the
<br />
table as air_density.
<br />
<br />With the aforementioned points in mind, and with regard to the preceding
<br />
discussions of the physical quantities and chemical species proposed
<br />
under this thread, there are many names on Martina's original list that
<br />
can now be accepted for inclusion in the standard name table, but
<br />
perhaps some that should not be because they may represent impossible
<br />
combinations.  Not being a chemist myself, I am not the best qualified
<br />
person to decide which combinations of species and process make sense.
<br />
To assist in identifying the valid combinations within this set of
<br />
proposals I have prepared an Excel spreadsheet containing physical
<br />
processes as column headings and species as row headings.  I have begun
<br />
to populate the cells of this spreadsheet, for example, I have marked
<br />
where the names proposed from the combination of process and species are
<br />
already in the table.  I have marked as 'OK' those cells where the
<br />
combination can be accepted immediately for inclusion in the standard
<br />
name table - these consist mostly of the various measures of abundance
<br />
such as mass_fraction, atmosphere_mass_content, etc.  I would greatly
<br />
appreciate some help in populating the remainder of the spreadsheet with
<br />
'YES' or 'NO' entries indicating whether particular combinations are
<br />
possible.  In one or two instances I have written comments regarding
<br />
specific names.  Please note that at present I have not included in the
<br />
spreadsheet any species or process names that are still under discussion
<br />
in this thread (i.e., the 'lumped' and grouped species, 'pmx_aerosol'
<br />
and 'passive_ozone' and the net_production, respiration,
<br />
optical_thickness and mole_flux processes).
<br />
<br />I will email Martina, Philip, Martin and Christiane directly for help
<br />
with the spreadsheet - you are the chemists whose names I know :) - but
<br />
contributions from others would also be most welcome.  The individual
<br />
standard name proposals will be accepted or rejected according to the
<br />
responses in the spreadsheet.  Any areas of disagreement or ambiguity
<br />
that come to light as a result of this exercise will be brought back to
<br />
the mailing list for further discussion.
<br />
<br />The standard names Guidelines document will need to be updated in
<br />
response to Martina's proposals.  We currently have a section in that
<br />
document called 'Transformations' which gives a number of 'template'
<br />
phrases that can be used within standard names to describe mathematical
<br />
quantities, for example, change_over_time_in_X, derivative_of_X_wrt_Y.
<br />
Jonathan suggested some time ago (not on the list) that we could
<br />
similarly include templates for the processes associated with the
<br />
chemical names.  I will add a section called 'Chemical phrases' and list
<br />
in there all the currently agreed phrases (such as
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_X_due_to_emission).  There is
<br />
already a 'Chemical Species' section, which is well out of date, and to
<br />
which I will now add all the currently agreed species.  Both sections of
<br />
the Guidelines will then be kept up to date as new chemical species and
<br />
phrases are agreed.
<br />
<br />Within this thread there has been some discussion of taking a 'two table
<br />
approach' to chemistry standard names, i.e., maintaining separate tables
<br />
of agreed chemical processes and species.  A number of advantages and
<br />
disadvantages of this approach have been discussed.  Philip pointed out
<br />
that one of the big advantages of a two table approach is that it makes
<br />
searching for existing names easier, e.g., it is easier to find out
<br />
whether a particular species has already been agreed for use in standard
<br />
names.  I hope that expanding the standard name Guidelines as described
<br />
above will go some way towards addressing the issue of searchability.
<br />
In fact, I think it would be quite easy to maintain the lists of
<br />
chemical phrases and chemical species as separate documents, linked to
<br />
from the Guidelines, but which could then be viewed separately if
<br />
needed.  Would that be a useful thing to do?  When we are discussing
<br />
proposals for new standard names it is often useful (as Martina has done
<br />
in this thread) to separate the discussion of phrases and species and I
<br />
hope we will continue to do that. Regarding the standard names
<br />
themselves, at present the general weight of opinion seems to be that it
<br />
is better to keep the process and species together in a single string
<br />
within the CF metadata, i.e., no change to the current design of
<br />
standard names.  If in future it is felt that there is a strong need to
<br />
allow the two table approach as an alternative, a change to the CF
<br />
conventions would probably need to be proposed.
<br />
<br />Martin and Martina have put forward the suggestion of a panel drawn from
<br />
the atmospheric chemistry community to coordinate future proposals to CF
<br />
for chemistry standard names.  I certainly welcome the willingness of
<br />
the atmospheric chemists to engage so fully with the CF process and
<br />
having domain experts to call on when dealing with particular sets of
<br />
proposals is very valuable.  It seems likely that there would be some
<br />
overlap between the function of a chemistry panel and the existing
<br />
standard names committee so I will need to discuss further with Bryan
<br />
Lawrence, chair of the CF standard names committee, on the best way to
<br />
coordinate activities.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Alison,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regarding the thread &quot;CF standard names for chemical constituents and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aerosols&quot;:.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we agreed on the new physical quantities, for the chemical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; names I am not sure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then the discussion shifted towards the more general topic of how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integrate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical CF standard names in future and afterwards to general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construction rules for all kinds of CF standard names.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My original proposal got a bit lost in these general discussions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore I would like to focus on the chemical names again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Physical Quantities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the mails from the 24.10.2008 we agreed on:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_X_due_to_respiration :
</em><br />
kg.m-2.s-
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tion :/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; /mol.m-3.s-1
</em><br />

</em><br />
tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_X_in_air_due_to_chemical_gross_destru
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; :/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; /mol.m-3.s-1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; density_of_surface_area_of_X, m-1, This is the surface area of aerosol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; per volume of atmosphere (i.e. /m2.m-3=m-1)/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Chemical Quantities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the new chemical species I am not that sure. I recall a discussion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about 'lumped' but cannot remember an agreement. The full list of
</em><br />
names
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for chemical species can be found in the wiki:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/CF_Standard_Names">http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/CF_Standard_Names</a>_-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _Construction_of_Atmospheric_Chemistry_and_Aerosol_Terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regarding my proposal, I tried to keep track and the new names I found
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my files are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atomic_oxygen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nitrate_radical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nitrous_acid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; radon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methyl_peroxy_radical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methanol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formic_acid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aceto_nitrile
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ethanol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acetic_acid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; butane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alpha_pinene
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beta_pinene
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limonene
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hcfc141b
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hcfc142b
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nitric_acid_trihydrate_aerosol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hox_expressed_as hydrogen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total_peroxy_radical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passive_ozone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noy_expressed_as_nitrogen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clox_expressed_as_chlorine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brox_expressed_as_bromine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_alkanes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_alkenes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_aromatic_compounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_terpenes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nmvoc_expressed_as_carbon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anthropogenic_nmvoc_expressed_as_carbon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biogenic_nmvoc_expressed_as_carbon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumped_oxygenated_hydrocarbons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Construction of &quot;chemical CF names&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The discussion about a naming convention and construction guideline
</em><br />
for
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemicals and aerosols is summed up by Christiane in the wiki:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<a href="http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Modfication_of_existing_CF_standard_n">http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Modfication_of_existing_CF_standard_n</a>
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ames.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The status there is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;physical quantity&gt;_of_&lt;chemical quantity&gt;_due_to_&lt;process&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nox_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _emission
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The position of &lt;medium&gt; is not absolutely clear, I would think:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;physical quantity&gt;_of_&lt;chemical
</em><br />
quantity&gt;_in_&lt;medium&gt;_due_to_&lt;process&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it is not a medium like &quot;air&quot; but a part of the earth system like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;atmosphere&quot; it is not agreed (as far as I know), whether it should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; placed like the medium or in front.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, the chemical names in the CF construction guideline
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/guidelines">http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/guidelines</a> are a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit out-dated and needs to be revised or replaced by a link to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentioned wiki page of the chemists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is still open to me (or I missed the agreement), is the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether the CF standards names with each individual chemical species
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of the CF convention or only the physical quantities and
</em><br />
processes
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a place-holder for the chemical quantity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Heinke proposed a possibility how we could deal with the place-holder
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (she called &quot;constituent&quot;) in netCDF-headers, about which I could not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find a real discussion,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2008/002421.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2008/002421.html</a>:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lat=72;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lon=124;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maxlen=30;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; float quantity(lat,lon,height,time) ;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity:standard_name = &quot;mass_fraction_of_constituent_in_air&quot; ;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity:units = &quot;1&quot; ;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity:coordinates = &quot;constituent&quot; ;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; char constituent(maxlen);

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constituent:standard_name='IUPAC_system';
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constituent='ozone';
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope to revive the discussion to reach an agreement of this rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; old
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thread as well, at least on the first and second parts (1. and 2.).
