<br />Jonathan, all,
<br />
<br />Yes, I have asked that question.  Short answer: No, I don't think it  
<br />
is possible to say what this means in the type of phrase you are  
<br />
looking for. Hence my conclusion that we may be stuck.
<br />
<br />Having spent the last two weeks learning 'what does that mean' --  
<br />
well, as much as high school chemistry allows -- I will  give you his  
<br />
answer, then mine.  It may help the list to know that most folks don't  
<br />
measure it directly (what we do at MBARI), especially in the deep  
<br />
ocean. Instead, pH is more commonly determined as the solution to an  
<br />
equation with several other measured components, and it appears to be  
<br />
the entire interaction of that chemical system that is referenced by  
<br />
the term, not simply a characterization of the single measurement.  
<br />
(The other chemical parts of the system determine key equilibrium  
<br />
constants that help specify the resulting interactions and the  
<br />
conversions between scales.) That may be a reason it resists summary.
<br />
<br />His answer: &quot;There are several systems for measuring pH in sea water,  
<br />
and this one best takes into account the chemistry and other  
<br />
interactions at the depths we make these observations.&quot;  (Yes, I know  
<br />
that is not sufficiently descriptive for your purposes.)  Any attempt  
<br />
to get a more concrete summary immediately devolves into detailed  
<br />
explanations of chemistry; our previous attempts at summary concepts  
<br />
appeared to be unsatisfactory on their face. We have since asked 2 of  
<br />
the leading experts in the field, with nearly identical results. (They  
<br />
offered a second reference[1] in support, and another set of  
<br />
explanatory detail, below -- note its final summary.) If there were  
<br />
any readily acceptable answer I think we would have found it.
<br />
<br />My answer, attempting to be more concrete: &quot;Ocean chemists have  
<br />
developed several regimes in which they perform their observations and  
<br />
state their results; this regime best derives the activity of hydrate  
<br />
ions taking into account temperature, pressure, high salinity  
<br />
(especially), and a wide range of pressures in situ.&quot; Any more precise  
<br />
summary of the context would require at least a few more sentences. To  
<br />
synthesize all those nouns into a meaningful and sufficiently specific  
<br />
phrase really would give you a Standard Paragraph.
<br />
<br />So. There we are.  Sorry I can not be more obliging, I really have  
<br />
tried but this one defies easy answers.
<br />
<br />The good news is, I will be off the list for the next week while on  
<br />
vacation. So you have plenty of time to consider or ignore these  
<br />
matters. :-&gt;
<br />
<br />Thanks for all your help considering this matter.
<br />

<br />
INTERNATIONAL UNION OF PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY -- MEASUREMENT OF  
<br />
pH.   DEFINITION, STANDARDS, AND PROCEDURES (IUPAC Recommendations 2002)
<br />
<br />================== Expert Recommendation on Naming ================
<br />
<br />The definitions are:
<br />
<br />(A)   pH(total) =  - log  ([H+]total / k0)  =  - log ( [H+]free (1 +  
<br />
ST/K(HSO4-)) / k0)
<br />
<br />(B)   pH(sws)  = - log ([H+]sws / k0)  =  - log ( [H+]free (1 + ST /  
<br />
K(HSO4-) + FT/K(HF)) / k0)
<br />
<br />(C)   pH(IUPAC) = operational pH calibrated using IUPAC primary  
<br />
standard buffers
<br />
<br />NOTES:
<br />
1.  Any measured pH value needs to also identify the temperature (&amp;  
<br />
pressure) at which it was measured.
<br />
<br />2. Although pH is a dimensionless quantity, the concentrations in (A)  
<br />
and (B) are specified in moles per kilogram of solution. That is k0  
<br />
has the value of 1 mol/kg-soln.
<br />
For (C), conventionally 10^-pH is thought of as a single ion activity  
<br />
for hydrogen ion with associated concentration units of mol/kg-H2O,  
<br />
though this is essentially meaningless for sea water.
<br />
<br />3. ST = total concentration of sulfate ion in seawater - f(salinity)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FT = total concentration of fluoride ion in seawater - f(salinity)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K(HSO4) = dissociation constant for HSO4 in seawater - free H+  
<br />
scale; f(salinity, temperature)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K(HF) = dissociation constant for HF in seawater - free H+ scale;  
<br />
f(salinity, temperature)
<br />
<br />4. Values of pH(SWS) or pH (total) ultimately are not calculated from  
<br />
the definitions (A) and (B) but are calibrated relative to hydrogen  
<br />
ion concentration values assigned to Tris/Tris-H+ buffers in synthetic  
<br />
seawater using a Harned cell. These buffers are then either used  
<br />
directly to calibrate a pH probe, or are used to assign a dissociation  
<br />
constant to a colorimetric indicator.
<br />
<br />5.  The reference for pH(IUPAC) is Buck et al. (2002) (attached).  
<br />
Older data may have been calibrated using the same primary buffers  
<br />
(originally developed at NBS in the late 1950s).
<br />
<br />6.  pH(IUPAC) implicitly includes a term (often of unknown magnitude)  
<br />
that is dependent on the liquid junction design for the pH cell, and  
<br />
is thus not recommended for precise work.
<br />
<br />I am not sure you can convey all this in 8 words or less. My  
<br />
preference is for definitions (A), (B) and (C), but if you are  
<br />
bringing separate data sets together, the devil could be in the  
<br />
details alluded to in the footnotes.
