Dear Nan and Roy
<br />
<br />I think it is a bit arbitrary whether one regards them as different quantities
<br />
or different methods of measurement, but now I am tending in the direction of
<br />
the latter because of what John last said about it. It is actually somewhere
<br />
between, because the answers are known to be systematically different with the
<br />
different methods. However, it turns out not to be possible to describe in a
<br />
phrase (even a long phrase) what the difference is. That is, if asked the
<br />
question in a seminar, the expert would say, &quot;The quantities differ because of
<br />
various details in the way they are measured.&quot; If the difference is so
<br />
detailed and hard to summarise, it seems to me that it really is a matter of
<br />
technique, and not of different geophysical quantities. I would expect it to be
<br />
possible to say, in a phrase, what the *essence* is of the difference between
<br />
geophysical quantities, whereas that cannot necessarily be done for methods.
<br />
Consequently, I would say that if we introduce a new attribute to identify
<br />
methods of measurement, we would not expect it to be as self-explanatory as
<br />
standard names. Whereas it is reasonable to expect an average scientist to
<br />
understand what is meant by a standard name, it is not necessary or reasonable
<br />
for different measurement/calculation methods. They depend on domain expertise.
<br />
Does that sound sensible to you?
<br />
<br />A new attribute would also be able to distinguish between cloud fraction from
<br />
cloudsat, calipso or isccp, which is the other example we've had. We've agreed
<br />
these intend to be the same geophysical quantity, but it is known or expected
<br />
that the retrievals from different instruments will not give exactly the same
<br />
answers. However, it is not possible to summarise simply what these differences
<br />
are or to give them a geophysical explanation. So this is again a matter of
<br />
methods of measurement, like pH scales, it seems to me.
<br />
<br />A further purpose for this attribute, if we designed it generally enough, could
<br />
be to identify the raw quantities which we have discussed in another thread.
<br />
The standard name for something could be a measured voltage, for instance,
<br />
and the other attribute says what function this quantity has in a sensor. That
<br />
definitely refers to methods of measurement.
<br />
<br />Regarding Nan's question, I think pH by all the definitions is a dimensionless
<br />
quantity. It is a logarithm, so it must be dimensionless. However, that
<br />
does imply that the quantity whose logarithm is being taken must be in certain
<br />
units, to get the right answer, numerically. That has to be recorded in the
<br />
definition of the quantity. I agree, that is awkward. There is some precedent
<br />
for this. For instance, we have some standard names which specify units of
<br />
decibels. These quantities are logarithms too, and involve a reference level,
<br />
with specified units, in their definition.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
