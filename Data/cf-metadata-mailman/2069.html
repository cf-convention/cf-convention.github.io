Dear All,
<br />
<br />Following my last posting in this thread, and the emails I sent asking
<br />
for assistance with the spreadsheet, I have received several helpful
<br />
responses which have cleared up a number of the areas still under
<br />
discussion.  Many thanks to all those who replied.  I have realised that
<br />
the responses came to me directly, rather than via the list, so in the
<br />
following I have tried to draw together all the relevant comments.  I
<br />
have also produced another version of my spreadsheet based on the
<br />
responses received from Martin and Christiane.  Rather than post it as
<br />
an attachment, I have placed a copy on the CF trac wiki at
<br />
<a href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/wiki">https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/wiki</a>.  The file is called
<br />
grib2_chem_names_2.xls and can be downloaded by anyone.  I have put some
<br />
more detailed comments about the spreadsheet at the end of this message.
<br />
<br />Please note that I will move the issue of passive_ozone to a separate
<br />
thread, as I think it may generate quite a lot of discussion.
<br />

<br />At present we have three respiration names in the table:

heterotrophic_respiration_carbon_flux, plant_respiration_carbon_flux and
<br />
soil_respiration_carbon_flux, all with different definitions.  I think
<br />
this is what prompted Jonathan's initial question.  If your names refer

simply to 'respiration' would it be safe to assume they represent the

sum of the individual processes?

Thanks for spotting that we have not specified the medium in these

names.  As with the gross_production|destruction names I think we need

to decide if these names describe a vertically integrated quantity or a

full 3D field.  We should then either prefix with atmosphere_ or add

in_air to the names, as appropriate.  Martina, please can you comment?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have now agreed in this thread to add the processes

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we had in 2007 when Christiane proposed net_production for use with
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; HTAP names.  Originally, Christiane proposed to use

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical_net_production but the word 'chemical' has been dropped from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the two names already in the table.  I couldn't find any discussion of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dropping 'chemical' and I now think this may have happened

accidentally
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when I added the names to the table.  I suggest, therefore, that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aliases should be created for the two existing names to change

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; net_production_and_emission to chemical_net_production_and_emission

<br />OK, thanks - we are agreed to use 'chemical' in the gross production

names and add it to the net production names.  I agree that Christiane's

suggestion of re-ordering the words is an improvement.  So we will now

have names of the form

<br />
<br />Regarding, Philip's discussion of 'gross production', the question was
<br />
about the definition of the term, particularly in relation to ozone.  I
<br />
think that Philip stated the question very clearly in his posting:
<br />
<a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2007/001788.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2007/001788.html</a>.
<br />
<br />Philip also said in a later posting
<br />
(<a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2007/001913.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2007/001913.html</a>):
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the issue of ozone GROSS production and loss which I raised in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (<a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2007/001788.html">http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2007/001788.html</a>) I am
</em><br />
conflicted.  This is a useful and commonly
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reported variable, but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition is not universally agreed upon.  In practice, experts
</em><br />
generally use definitions that are within the same 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ball-park as each other, but an outside user could be led astray, and
</em><br />
judicious care needs to be used when comparing &gt; figures from different
<br />
models.  Whether this is enough to stop it being accepted by CF, I don't
<br />
know.
<br />
<br />Jonathan responded to this by saying
<br />
(<a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2007/001914.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2007/001914.html</a>):
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know the details of this case, of course, but I don't think
</em><br />
that's a reason not to include a name for ozone &gt; gross production. If
<br />
it is useful to compare quantities from different datasets for certain
<br />
purposes, even though 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they may have somewhat different definitions, then it will be useful
</em><br />
to assign them a common name to indicate they 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are comparable. That is the main purpose of standard names. To avoid
</em><br />
misunderstanding, the definition could state 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what distinctions are being ignored. For more exacting applications in
</em><br />
which the differences of definition are 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material, alternative more precisely phrased standard names could be
</em><br />
devised.

<br />
agreed with Jonathan's suggestion.
<br />
<br />This leads me to ask whether defining gross_production|destruction is
<br />
particularly problematic in relation to ozone, or whether we need to
<br />
think carefully about its definition in all cases.  We have already
<br />
agreed that the definitions for 'group' species need to be carefully
<br />
written to say how precisely/loosely the individual quantities are
<br />
defined.  Do we need to take a similar approach with
<br />
gross_production|destruction?  Of course, the standard name definitions
<br />
would not give details of which specific chemical reactions are included
<br />
or excluded, but they would alert data producers of the need to provide
<br />
additional information (and data consumers would know to check for that
<br />
information).

<br />Just to clarify, the pmX species appear in only six existing standard

<br />
atmosphere_optical_thickness_due_to_pm10_ambient_aerosol
<br />
atmosphere_optical_thickness_due_to_pm1_ambient_aerosol

atmosphere_optical_thickness_due_to_pm2p5_ambient_aerosol

mass_fraction_of_pm10_aerosol_in_air
<br />
mass_fraction_of_pm1_aerosol_in_air
<br />
mass_fraction_of_pm2p5_aerosol_in_air
<br />
<br />It was agreed under the 'Modification of some existing CF standard names
<br />
for chemical constituents' thread that the three mass_fraction names
<br />
would be changed to pmX_ambient_aerosol.  The definitions also clearly
<br />
refer to ambient aerosol, for example, the definition of
<br />
mass_fraction_of_pm10_(ambient)_aerosol_in_air reads:
<br />
&quot;Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y,
<br />
where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass
<br />
of X to the mass of Y (including X). &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended
<br />
liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets).  &quot;Ambient
<br />
aerosol&quot; is aerosol that has taken up ambient water through hygroscopic
<br />
growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative
<br />
humidity and the composition of the aerosol. &quot;Pm10 aerosol&quot; is an air
<br />
pollutant with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10
<br />
micrometers. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which
<br />
the particle size applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with the
<br />
standard names of, respectively, &quot;relative_humidity&quot; and
<br />
&quot;air_temperature&quot;.
<br />
<br />The question now is whether pmX should be 'dry' or 'ambient' in
<br />
Martina's proposed names.  I did a quick search on the web and it seems
<br />
that most health regulations regarding limits on the concentrations of
<br />
various particle sizes do refer to ambient conditions. Also, sampling
<br />
techniques for atmospheric aerosol seem to assume some water content.
<br />
However, I am not the expert here so I'd welcome further advice on this
<br />
point.  I think the main question is whether the particles are generally
<br />
assumed to be dry or ambient in the models that are presumably the
<br />
source of the GRIB 2 data.  If both measures are required, then we could
<br />
introduce names for both dry and ambient aerosol.

<br />It is likely that a number of names along the lines you are suggesting

tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_carbon_dioxide_due_to_process,

<br />Many, many thanks to you both for your help.  I have added your changes
<br />
into my spreadsheet, now available on the CF trac wiki at
<br />
<a href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/wiki">https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/wiki</a> (grib2_chem_names_2.xls).
<br />
Christiane's comments appear in blue, Martin's in red and my new
<br />
additions (i.e. the newly added processes and species) appear in green.
<br />
<br />The following questions and comments arise from the work that has been
<br />
done on the spreadsheet.
<br />
<br />1. Christiane commented:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sulfate should be replaced by sulfate_aerosol.
</em><br />
I'm sorry, I don't really understand this comment.  Are you saying that
<br />
the 'sulfate' row should simply be deleted?  (There is already a row for
<br />
sulfate_dry_aerosol.)  Or are you saying that we should change 'sulfate'
<br />
in the spreadsheet to sulfate_ambient_aerosol?
<br />
(N.B. There are some older 'sulfate_aerosol' names currently in the
<br />
table, but in the 'Modification of some existing CF standard names for
<br />
chemical constituents' thread it was agreed that they would be aliased
<br />
to 'sulfate_ambient_aerosol' names as follows:
<br />
atmosphere_content_of_sulfate_aerosol becomes
<br />
atmosphere_mass_content_of_sulfate_ambient_aerosol
<br />
mass_concentration_of_sulfate_aerosol_in_air becomes
<br />
mass_concentration_of_sulfate_ambient_aerosol_in_air.
<br />
There is also an existing name, atmosphere_sulfate_content, which
<br />
presumably refers to sulfate in both aerosols and the gas phase).
<br />
<br />2. Christiane commented:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aerosols cannot expressed as molar quantities if they do not have a
</em><br />
defined molar mass.
<br />
This means that standard names proposals for all molar quantities for
<br />
the following species are rejected:
<br />
black_carbon_dry_aerosol
<br />
dust_dry_aerosol
<br />
particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol
<br />
primary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol
<br />
secondary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol
<br />
seasalt_dry_aerosol
<br />
Also, it is not clear whether molar quantities for the following species
<br />
should be included:
<br />
ammonium_dry_aerosol
<br />
mercury_dry_aerosol
<br />
nitrate_dry_aerosol
<br />
sulfate_dry_aerosol
<br />
because presumably these would cover a mixture of aerosol species.
<br />
<br />3. As discussed above, columns for net_chemical_production and
<br />
net_chemical_production_and_emission have been added now that the
<br />
process names have been agreed and rows have been added for the recently
<br />
agreed species.  These new sections of the spreadsheet contain few
<br />
entries at present and help in populating them would be very much
<br />
appreciated. Does the point that Christiane raised in (2) regarding
<br />
undefined molar masses for aerosols also apply to the combined species
<br />
such as 'alkanes'? 
<br />
<br />4. There is disagreement as to whether the following are valid names:
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_methyl_hydroperoxide_due_to_dry_d
<br />
eposition
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_dinitrogen_pentoxide_due_to_wet_d
<br />
eposition
<br />
<br />5. Gross destruction/production names:
<br />
Martin commented (above) that he has marked those names that would
<br />
actually be used in the immediate future and suggested that we do not
<br />
include the remaining names for the present.  Are there any objections
<br />
to taking that approach?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jonathan suggested some time ago (not on the list) that we could

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similarly include templates for the processes associated with the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical names.  I will add a section called 'Chemical phrases' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list in there all the currently agreed phrases (such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_X_due_to_emission).  There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already a 'Chemical Species' section, which is well out of date, and
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I will now add all the currently agreed species.  Both sections
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Guidelines will then be kept up to date as new chemical species
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and phrases are agreed.

<br />
<br />I agree that Christiane's wiki page is an excellent resource for the
<br />
chemistry names and it has been extremely useful in identifying both the
<br />
gaps and the inconsistencies in CF standard names.  I'm sure that the
<br />
chemistry names would not be in anything like as good a state as they
<br />
are now without Christiane's efforts to organise all the information.  I
<br />
will certainly take note of that page when updating the Guidelines.  I
<br />
think it is important for there to be a central record of the way in
<br />
which CF standard names (not only chemistry names) are constructed and
<br />
the Guidelines document is the natural place to gather all the
<br />
information.  I would like to give the Guidelines document a more
<br />
prominent role in future (in fact I think it should probably be renamed
<br />
'Rules for Construction of CF Standard Names') and my intention is to
<br />
extend and restructure it where necessary so that it contains as much
<br />
helpful and relevant information as possible.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Martin and Martina have put forward the suggestion of a panel drawn

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the atmospheric chemistry community to coordinate future

proposals
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to CF for chemistry standard names.  I certainly welcome the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; willingness of the atmospheric chemists to engage so fully with the CF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process and having domain experts to call on when dealing with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular sets of proposals is very valuable.  It seems likely that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there would be some overlap between the function of a chemistry panel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the existing standard names committee so I will need to discuss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further with Bryan Lawrence, chair of the CF standard names committee,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the best way to coordinate activities.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  well, practical experience shows that in the end it does fall back on

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you. As long as this is ok for you and we don't feel that it becomes

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inefficient, we should probably leave things as they are now. I think

at
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some point we had thought that things could perhaps move a little

faster,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but in hindsight I admit that it was probably good not to rush things

too
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quickly. If we have re-iterated the present set of propositions we

will have
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achieved a great deal already, and I hope that the amount of future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposals from the chemistry side will decline. The addition of new

species
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be relatively straightforward (at some point we should make sure

that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least all species from the GRIB table are included), and I cannot
</em><br />
see too
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many new quantitities (=terms) which should be needed.

</em><br />
<br />OK, thank you for your comments.  I hope that we are now on the right
<br />
track with the chemistry names.  From my own point of view, always the
<br />
most helpful thing is to be able to seek the advice of domain experts,
<br />
whether in chemistry or in the other areas of science covered by CF.
<br />
I'd like to say a big thank you to all the people who take the time to
<br />
participate in the standard names discussions.
