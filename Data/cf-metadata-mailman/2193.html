Dear all
<br />
<br />I confess to not having read what the user guide says (at least, not recently)
<br />
and I have copied it below in case others would like to be reminded as well.
<br />
<br />This suggests that Nan's extra conventions for oceansites would correctly be
<br />
denoted &quot;CF-1.4/OceanSITES-1.0&quot;, since oceansites accepts all of CF and adds
<br />
some more. We could, for instance, amend the CF convention to recommend this
<br />
format for additional conventions that explicitly say they adopt all of CF
<br />
and add some more. I am sure the checker could be amended to ignore whatever
<br />
follows / in the Conventions attribute.
<br />
<br />As a matter of policy, I would hope that subconventions like this would only
<br />
be added if the extra conventions were too application-specific to be of
<br />
general use. New ideas which could apply in other areas could usefully be
<br />
added to the main CF standard.
<br />
<br />The user guide doesn't say anything about spaces. It doesn't prohibit them,
<br />
but it does talk about conventions names being filenames. Although filenames
<br />
containing spaces are possible, they're a nuisance on Unix, and it seems to me
<br />
they would be a hazard in this context. People often put in extra spaces, or
<br />
leave out spaces, fairly arbitrarily in strings, and if they are significant
<br />
that would be an error. Wouldn't it be better to recommend against spaces in
<br />
conventions names in the netCDF user guide?
<br />
<br />This user guide convention with / is for subconventions. It doesn't deal with
<br />
the situation where several separately developed conventions are being used,
<br />
and you might want to put them in a blank-separated or comma-separated list.
<br />
I don't think we should allow that in the Conventions attribute unless and
<br />
until we'd decided how to resolve conflicts between these conventions. (There
<br />
are no conflicts with a subconvention that explicitly accepts all the of the
<br />
standard to which it is adding.)
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf.html#Attribute-Conventions">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf.html#Attribute-Conventions</a>
</em><br />
<br />If present, 'Conventions' is a global attribute that is a character array for
<br />
the name of the conventions followed by the dataset, in the form of a string
<br />
that is interpreted as a directory name relative to a directory that is a
<br />
repository of documents describing sets of discipline-specific
<br />
conventions. This permits a hierarchical structure for conventions and
<br />
provides a place where descriptions and examples of the conventions may be
<br />
maintained by the defining institutions and groups. The conventions directory
<br />
name is currently interpreted relative to the directory
<br />
pub/netcdf/Conventions/ on the host machine
<br />
ftp.unidata.ucar.edu. Alternatively, a full URL specification may be used to
<br />
name a WWW site where documents that describe the conventions are maintained.
<br />
<br />For example, if a group named NUWG agrees upon a set of conventions for
<br />
dimension names, variable names, required attributes, and netCDF
<br />
representations for certain discipline-specific data structures, they may
<br />
store a document describing the agreed-upon conventions in a dataset in the
<br />
NUWG/ subdirectory of the Conventions directory. Datasets that followed these
<br />
conventions would contain a global Conventions attribute with value &quot;NUWG&quot;.
<br />
<br />Later, if the group agrees upon some additional conventions for a specific
<br />
subset of NUWG data, for example time series data, the description of the
<br />
additional conventions might be stored in the NUWG/Time_series/ subdirectory,
<br />
and datasets that adhered to these additional conventions would use the global
<br />
Conventions attribute with value &quot;NUWG/Time_series&quot;, implying that this
<br />
dataset adheres to the NUWG conventions and also to the additional NUWG
<br />
time-series conventions.
