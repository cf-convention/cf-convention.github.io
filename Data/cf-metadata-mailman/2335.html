Dear Thomas,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your email asking about the status of these names.
<br />
Looking back at your last posting, I think we had essentially arrived at
<br />
agreement on the following names, units and definitions:
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_ice_displacement; m
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time. If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a
<br />
rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the
<br />
start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the
<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;Eastward&quot;
<br />
indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward
<br />
(negative westward). An eastward displacement is the distance across the
<br />
earth's surface calculated from the change in a moving object's
<br />
longitude between the start and end of the time interval associated with
<br />
the displacement variable.
<br />
<br />northward_sea_ice_displacement; m
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a
<br />
rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the
<br />
start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the
<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;Northward&quot;
<br />
indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward
<br />
(negative southward).  A northward displacement is the distance across
<br />
the earth's surface calculated from the change in a moving object's
<br />
latitude between the start and end of the time interval associated with
<br />
the displacement variable.
<br />
<br />sea_ice_x_displacement; m
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a
<br />
rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the
<br />
start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the
<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;x&quot; indicates a
<br />
vector component along the grid x-axis, when this is not true longitude,
<br />
positive with increasing x.  An x displacement is calculated from the
<br />
difference in the moving object's grid x coordinate between the start
<br />
and end of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
sea_ice_y_displacement; m
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a
<br />
rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the
<br />
start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the
<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component. &quot;y&quot; indicates a
<br />
vector component along the grid y-axis, when this is not true latitude,
<br />
positive with increasing y.  A y displacement is calculated from the
<br />
difference in the moving object's grid y coordinate between the start
<br />
and end of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.
<br />
<br />sea_ice_displacement; m
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a
<br />
rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the
<br />
start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the
<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  In that case,
<br />
&quot;displacement&quot; is also the distance across the earth's surface
<br />
calculated from the change in a moving object's geospatial position
<br />
between the start and end of the time interval associated with the
<br />
displacement variable.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
direction_of_sea_ice_displacement; degrees
<br />
'Displacement' means the change in geospatial position of an object that
<br />
has moved over time.  If possible, the time interval over which the
<br />
motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the
<br />
time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a
<br />
vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a
<br />
rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the
<br />
start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the
<br />
time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement
<br />
does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as
<br />
a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.  &quot;direction_of_X&quot;
<br />
means direction of a vector, a bearing.  The
<br />
'direction of displacement' is the angle between due north and the
<br />
displacement vector.
<br />
<br />However, you also raised a number of questions which could affect the
<br />
final form of the names and I've tried to address these below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My displacement is nothing more that a
</em><br />
'change_over_time_in_geoposition'. Is there actually a quantity X for
<br />
'geoposition' (which would be lat/lon)?&gt; I saw that there was a
<br />
reference to 'position' in
<br />
magnitude_of_derivative_of_position_wrt_model_level_number where it is a
<br />
3D position.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Displacements can be 3D so 'displacement' is maybe nothing more than a
</em><br />
'change_over_time_in_position', with 'position' being a 3D point. I do
<br />
not
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know if we will win anything in recognizing the aliasing but it might
</em><br />
help understanding how to build the standard_name as well as the time
<br />
bounds
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing. Plus, I did not find the definition of what
</em><br />
'change_over_y_in_x' describes but it is clear that we cannot use it for
<br />
displacement if the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'change' is intended as being 'continuous', like dx/dy = constant for
</em><br />
all y.
<br />
<br />There is no standard name for 'geoposition'.  Indeed, recently there was
<br />
a discussion thread entitled &quot;standard name for position&quot; (see
<br />
<a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2009/003011.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2009/003011.html</a> and
<br />
followups) in which this same issue arose.  The general conclusion was
<br />
that &quot;position&quot; or &quot;geoposition&quot; is already given by the values of
<br />
variables with the standard names &quot;latitude&quot; and &quot;longitude&quot; and there
<br />
was not a strong case for introducing a separate name for the
<br />
combination of coordinates.
<br />
<br />'Change_over_y_in_x' currently only appears in standard names for the
<br />
case where y is time, but I dare say it could be defined for other
<br />
situations if it became necessary.  'Change_over_time_in_X' is defined
<br />
as 'change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined
<br />
by the bounds of the time coordinate' and doesn't impose any condition
<br />
about the change being continuous. However, if we were to change to your
<br />
alternative suggestion of 'change_over_time_in_position', rather than
<br />
'displacement', I think your names actually become more difficult to
<br />
express.  For example, initially I considered that
<br />
eastward_sea_ice_displacement might become
<br />
change_over_time_in_sea_ice_longitude, but that would have units of
<br />
degrees instead of metres which isn't what you are after.  If we used
<br />
something like change_over_time_in_sea_ice_eastward_position I think
<br />
that it still isn't obviously a quantity in metres (although
<br />
change_over_time_in_sea_ice_x|y_position might be OK for displacements
<br />
on your map projection).  I think the point is that we need to get
<br />
across the idea of moving through a distance measured in units of
<br />
length, rather than a change in coordinate with its associated units,
<br />
and 'displacement' is a concise way of doing that.
<br />
<br />Names such as eastward_sea_ice_displacement are consistent with existing
<br />
names like eastward_sea_ice_velocity and names proposed for the CMIP5
<br />
model data, such as eastward_sea_ice_transport, which I think is another
<br />
argument for sticking with the names we had agreed.
<br />
<br />Importantly, I don't think the choice of standard name for the
<br />
displacements really affects your treatment of the time coordinate
<br />
variable and time bounds, which is really a separate question.  For this
<br />
and all the other reasons, I think we should stick with the agreed
<br />
names.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would however like to discuss here the time bounds thing and see if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone can help me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding how/if I can apply the concept to my data model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we agree that :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) the time interval is crucial for the displacement variable to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpreted;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) that time bounds is the current implementation of an interval. If I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want CF compliance, I should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live with this fact.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I note that you have sought further discussion of the time coordinate
<br />
and time_bounds question in the &quot;Cell bounds associated with coordinate
<br />
variable rather than data variable&quot; thread, so I have not discussed it
<br />
further here.  I think discussing the issues separately is probably the
<br />
best way to proceed.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
