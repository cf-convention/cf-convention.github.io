<br />
Dear all
<br />
<br />Using metadata to describe a file internally is much more robust than encoding
<br />
filenames in a file, and therefore seems preferable to me. I am concerned that
<br />
the gridspec proposal suggests using relative filenames in an attribute in the
<br />
file (associate_files). If I understand correctly, that would mean it would be
<br />
broken if you chosen to give your local copies of CMIP5 files different names
<br />
or store them in a different directory arrangement from the one they have in
<br />
the archive. (I don't keep my CMIP3 data in the same arrangement as it is held
<br />
in PCMDI.)
<br />
<br />I assume that CMIP5 CF-netCDF files will have other metadata in them
<br />
identifying the institution and so on, as global attributes, along the lines
<br />
that Steve mentions. But to make life easier for software which wants to verify
<br />
the relationship of the files, a UUID or a URL would be useful, wouldn't it?
<br />
I would suggest that those responsible for archiving and distributing CMIP5
<br />
data (PCMDI and others) could assign a unique identifier for each model-
<br />
scenario-ensemble_member as the data is made available by the modelling centre.
<br />
These are data-spaces within which CF metadata will distinguish every datum,
<br />
but the data-spaces themselves need to be distinguished. A unique identifier
<br />
would be more robust than a combination of more descriptive metadata, as well
<br />
as easier to process, I would say.
<br />
<br />Tagged with a unique identifier (UUID or URL), there should be no need for
<br />
a checksum on the file. There should be only one file having the right gridspec
<br />
details for a given UUID. References within the file to variables in other
<br />
files can be just by variable name, without any extended _at_ syntax. But it is
<br />
too restrictive to insist that variable names can't be repeated within the
<br />
group of files sharing a UUID, since often they will be: if the files are
<br />
organised by time ranges, for instance, there will be many time coord variables
<br />
and data variables with part of the data, and it would be a great nuisance to
<br />
have to give them all unique variable names. I suggest that the rule should be,
<br />
when a variable is referred to by name,
<br />
<br />* if a variable of that name exists within the same file, it is the one meant.
<br />
<br />* if it doesn't exist in the file, there must be only one variable with this
<br />
name anywhere in the set of files.
<br />
<br />However, I also think that using unique identifiers to define groups will
<br />
sometimes be too restrictive. I would like it to be possible to treat any
<br />
set of files I choose as a single dataset. For example, since a file with
<br />
cell measures like area and volume, or a gridspec file, will often be the same
<br />
for many or all experiments using a given model, I may wish to have only one
<br />
copy of it, and use it for all the different datasets, even though they have
<br />
different unique identifiers. Another example is that I might wish to treat
<br />
data from different ensemble members of an experiment as part of the same
<br />
dataset, so I can aggregate it with an ensemble axis and then compute stats
<br />
by collapsing that axis. This flexibility can easily be achieved simply by
<br />
allowing the option of ignoring the unique identifier, but still allowing
<br />
references from one file to another by variable name alone. In this more
<br />
flexible case, how the group of files is identified depends on the software
<br />
being used, of course. This is the principle of the cdms cdscan tool, for
<br />
example, which will treat any arbitrary group of files as a single dataset.
<br />
<br />To summarise, therefore, I suggest that
<br />
* a CF attribute should be defined to store a unique identifier for a dataset
<br />
spread across an arbitrary set of files. Within the dataset, other CF metadata
<br />
must be sufficient to identify each datum uniquely.
<br />
* CMIP5 should assign such an identifier for each run submitted and CMOR should
<br />
be able to record it in the files generated. I think these unique IDs would
<br />
actually be quite handy for keeping track of CMIP5 data.
<br />
* gridspec could refer to variables by name alone, with no associated_files
<br />
attribute or checksum being required, as the unique id will serve those
<br />
purposes.
<br />
* CF should permit variables to be referred to by name alone in another file,
<br />
subject to rules (such as proposed above). It is a decision of the data user
<br />
whether the associated files should be required to have the same unique ID.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
