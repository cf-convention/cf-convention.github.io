Thanks Alison,
<br />
<br />The one point I think you have possibly misunderstood is the one about 'miscellaneous'.  It's not the word, so much as the possibility of the concept having meaning that changes with time that worries me.  This can be addressed through the definition by a statement that 'miscellaneous means phytoplankton that are not diatoms, diazotrophs, calcareous phytoplankton or picophytoplankton'.  I did briefly consider the phrase 'phytoplankton_not_diatom_diazotroph_calcareous_pico' in the standard name, but then thought better of it.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

Subject: Re: [CF-metadata] CMIP5 ocean biogeochemistry standard names
<br />
<br />Dear Roy,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some (ended up quite a lot) comments.  Any discussion of this lot
</em><br />
could
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well descend into chaos.  Could I suggest that responses are made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separately to each of the 11 numbered comments so we end up with 11
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; threads that individually stand some chance of closure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />If possible, I would prefer not to create a large number of separate
<br />
threads as that can sometimes make it difficult to follow complete
<br />
conversations when looking back through the mailing list archives.
<br />
Names can be accepted as they are agreed which will allow them to be
<br />
added to the standard name table, even if others are still under
<br />
discussion.  Regarding your specific comments, I have tried to address
<br />
each one in turn.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) I don't understand what the definition of picophytoplankton
</em><br />
(carbon
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concentration from the picophytoplankton (&lt;2 um; &lt; 5um) component
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alone) means  Does it mean cells between 2 and 5 um in size, in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case it should be expressed as 2-5um, or does it mean something else?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I agree that this definition doesn't make sense as it stands - I'll
<br />
check with John Dunne.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
'mole_concentration_of_miscellaneous_phytoplankton_expressed_as_carbon_
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in_sea_water' is a very imprecise term that I think needs specifying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more precisely.  Once the definition is tightened up finding a better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phrase for the Standard Name should be possible. Likewise for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
'mole_concentration_of_miscellaneous_zooplankton_expressed_as_carbon_in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _sea_water', '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
mass_concentration_of_miscellaneous_phytoplankton_expressed_as_chloroph
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yll_in_sea_water', .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />My understanding of &quot;miscellaneous&quot; is that it means all the other
<br />
phytoplankton that are not mentioned in the names for specific
<br />
categories such as diatoms, diazatrophs, picophytoplankton, etc.  In
<br />
that sense it is intended to allow a looser definition than some of the
<br />
other names. I think that
<br />
diatoms + diazotrophs + calcareous phytoplankton + picophytoplankton +
<br />
miscellaneous phytoplankton = total phytoplankton.
<br />
This information will certainly be included in the definitions of all
<br />
the relevant names.  However, if we can come up with a more meaningful
<br />
collective noun than &quot;miscellaneous&quot; then I'd welcome suggestions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3) 'mole_concenration_of_dissolved_iron_in_sea_water'.  Besides the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; typo (concentration), does this refer to iron in all oxidation states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Fe2+/Fe3+) and chemical environments.  If so, calling it 'total iron'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be better.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for pointing out the typo - I'll correct it.  I think whenever
<br />
the word &quot;total&quot; has come up in standard names proposals in the past
<br />
that we have tried to avoid using it.  Indeed, there are no standard
<br />
names that use the term.  I think &quot;iron&quot; essentially should be
<br />
understood to mean &quot;total iron&quot; and if we want more specific names for
<br />
Fe2+, etc, we should introduce terms such as &quot;divalent iron&quot; in the way
<br />
that we have done for elemental and divalent mercury in the atmosphere.
<br />
Having said all that, I think it would be helpful if John could clarify
<br />
the definition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (4) There are a number of standard names for elemental concentrations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the particulate phase where the long names are very familiar to me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the Standard Names seem counter-intuitive, such as '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
mole_concentration_of_particulate_organic_matter_expressed_as_nitrogen_
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in_sea_water' for the parameter commonly known as particulate organic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nitrogen or more usually PON.  I guess what is bugging me is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard name describes the primary quantity as the suspended
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particulate material (SPM) concentration, whereas in fact the chemical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; composition of the SPM is of at least equal importance.
</em><br />
<br />I think the main reason for arriving at this particular wording was to
<br />
be consistent with existing standard names.  We use
<br />
particulate_organic_matter in quite a number of existing atmosphere
<br />
names. The &quot;expressed_as_species&quot; construction and its position within
<br />
the standard name was also something that we arrived at after lengthy
<br />
discussion with the atmospheric chemists.  I think that we should try,
<br />
as far as is practicable, to keep the wording and construction of
<br />
standard names consistent between the different components of the
<br />
climate system.  I don't think the order of the wording is intended to
<br />
imply that the particulate state is more or less important than the name
<br />
of the chemical species.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (5) I have much deeper rooted problems with '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_organic_carbon_in_sea_water_due_to_ne
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t_primary_production' for primary production.  In a nutshell, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process of primary production involves the transition of primarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inorganic carbon in the dissolved phase into organic carbon in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particulate phase (in the form of plant cells).  The standard name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gives no indication that the organic carbon quantity change is in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particulate phase.  At the very least I think we need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
'tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_particulate_organic_carbon_in_sea_wa
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ter_due_to_net_primary_production', which with the existing syntax
</em><br />
form
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would in fact become '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_particulate_organic_matter_expressed_
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as_carbon_in_sea_water_due_to_net_primary_production'. Ditto for new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; production, biogenic iron production and biogenic silica production,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but this doesn't apply to calcite and aragonite which are be
</em><br />
definition
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of the particulate phase being crystalline forma of calcium
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbonate. Also affects primary production by phytoplankton groups
</em><br />
such
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as diatoms (lines 53-57 of the spreadsheet).
</em><br />
<br />Thank you for clarifying the production process.  Personally, I would be
<br />
happy with the addition of the word &quot;particulate&quot;, as you suggest.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (6) I now see,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'sinking_mole_flux_of_particulate_organic_carbon_in_sea_water', which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if for consistency with the POC standard name would need to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'sinking_mole_flux_of_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particulate_organic_matter_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally, I much prefer 'particulate_organic_carbon'.
</em><br />
<br />I see your point.  Having argued for consistency of naming conventions
<br />
above, I would actually tend to favour
<br />
sinking_mole_flux_of_particulate_organic_matter_expressed_as_carbon_in_s
<br />
ea_water.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (7)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
'tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_dissolved_iron_in_sea_water_due_to_s
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cavenging_by_particles' should be '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_dissolved_iron_in_sea_water_due_to_sc
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; avenging_by_inorganic_particles'.  'particles' could easily be taken
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include plankton.  Similarly for '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_dissolved_iron_in_sea_water_due_to_di
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ssolution_from_particles'.
</em><br />
<br />That sounds fine to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (8) When we come to integrated primary production the standard name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntax becomes ' net_primary_mole_productivity_of_carbon' instead of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
'net_tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_particulate_organic_carbon_in_se
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a_water_due_to_net_primary_production' (which in itself needs
</em><br />
revising:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see above). I'm not sure how comfortable biogeochemists would be with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the use of 'net' to signify depth integration.  'net' tends to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other meanings such as the result of competing processes like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photosynthesis and respiration in oxygen budgets.  I would much prefer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'depth_integrated'.
</em><br />
<br />I think &quot;net&quot; refers to the productivity (i.e. net productivity = gross
<br />
productivity minus destruction) rather than to the vertical integration.
<br />
The vertical integration is implied by the fact that the units of this
<br />
quantity are mol m-2 s-1, rather than mol m-3 s-1 for 3-D tendencies.
<br />
In fact, Jonathan's idea was to reserve the term &quot;productivity&quot;
<br />
specifically to mean this type of vertically integrated quantity (as in
<br />
the atmosphere names gross_primary_productivity_of_carbon and
<br />
net_primary_productivity_of_carbon) and use &quot;production&quot; for the 3-D
<br />
quantities.  The definition of the name needs to make this clear.  If we
<br />
wanted to make the vertical integration part of the name itself the
<br />
correct syntax would be
<br />
integral_wrt_depth_of_tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_particulate_orga
<br />
nic_carbon_in_sea_water_due_to_net_primary_production.  Would that be
<br />
better?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (9) When we come to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_iron_due_to_biological_production',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no indication at all that the quantity is depth integrated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ditto for lines 75-78, 86, 95-106.
</em><br />
<br />The term &quot;content&quot; is well established in standard names to mean a
<br />
vertically integrated quantity, for example, there are many
<br />
&quot;atmosphere_content&quot; names with precisely this interpretation.  This is
<br />
really just a convention that has been adopted within CF but it is one
<br />
that has been used pretty much from the inception of standard names, I
<br />
believe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (10)
</em><br />
'surface_downward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon'
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't indicate to me the that it's a flux from atmosphere to water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body that's involved.  It could equally well be a chemical flux
</em><br />
between
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two layers of the atmosphere, or is 'surface' explicitly defined as
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ocean/atmosphere interface?
</em><br />
<br />The definition of &quot;surface&quot; in standard names is &quot;the surface called
<br />
&quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere&quot; which in this case
<br />
does indeed mean the atmosphere interface with the sea surface, although
<br />
it could also mean the interface with dry land, land-ice, sea-ice, etc.,
<br />
depending on the quantity being described.  If we were talking about a
<br />
layer interface within a medium then we would need to adopt some new
<br />
terminology to describe it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (11) Rows 95-106 refer to the rate of change of depth integrated
</em><br />
values
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the upper 100m of the water column, but the standard name gives no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indication that it's depth integrated (see above) or that the region
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interest is confined to the top 100m.  I can appreciate the quandry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here that standard names shouldn't indicate spatial coverage, but
</em><br />
might
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it be possible to argue that the top 100m of the water column
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approximates to a layer (euphotic zone?) of the ocean that should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treated in the same way as layers of the atmosphere?
</em><br />
<br />As in point (9), the use of the term &quot;content&quot; and the units of mol m-2
<br />
s-1 indicate that the quantities are vertical integrals. In practice,
<br />
variables containing these quantities would also need to have vertical
<br />
coordinate bounds to specify the limits of integration and this fact can
<br />
be indicated in the definitions of the names.
<br />
<br />Thanks very much for taking the time to look through all these names and
<br />
for posting your comments.  I think that with a small number of
<br />
adjustments these names are generally in pretty good shape.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
