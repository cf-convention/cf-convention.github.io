Dear Martin et al
<br />
<br />Some quantities are so specific to a particular dataset or model that it would
<br />
not be worth the effect of defining a standard name for them, since they will
<br />
never be compared with data from another source, the main reason for standard
<br />
names being to indicate which quantities should be regarded as comparable. In
<br />
those cases, I think having your own private attribute such as htap_standard_
<br />
name is the best solution. Other projects have done that before; for instance
<br />
the aquaplanet model intercomparion project has APE_names. This is Steve's
<br />
solution (2). The attribute is not standard and the vocabulary is private; it
<br />
perfectly legal to have non-CF attributes in CF files.
<br />
<br />If the project is itself comparing data from different sources, it would be
<br />
make sense to use standard names. As Roy says, CF standard names aren't purely
<br />
geophysical quantities any more. There are others related to measurements and
<br />
technical details. I think it's fine to have standard names for such things
<br />
in cases where different data sources are dealing with comparable quantities
<br />
and they have to work out how to identify them in a common way.
<br />
<br />I would much prefer keeping to a single attribute and namespace. It's much
<br />
more convenient to look at one attribute than to search for many, as John
<br />
says. Fragmentation of the namespace can in principle be resolved by mappings,
<br />
but in practice that would not happen, I am sure and Roy also suggests, just
<br />
because it would be a lot of work, and if it's not done, that would seriously
<br />
undermine the usefulness of standard names. Part of the reason why agreeing
<br />
them takes so long is that we have to understand what they mean, in order to
<br />
be sure that the new ones are not duplicating existing ones, and that they are
<br />
constructed in a consistent way, which will make it easier for future users to
<br />
understand them too.
<br />
<br />Therefore, like others, I prefer a fast-track approach, like John's suggestion
<br />
and Steve's (1), to deal with new standard names. I think we need a CF central
<br />
repository for proposed standard names. That would be useful anyway to monitor
<br />
their progress. I know that BADC have been working in this direction, although
<br />
I don't know the status. The repository should be kept up to date by modifying
<br />
it as proposed standard names are amended, accepted or rejected. We could say
<br />
that some reasonable interval after a standard name has been proposed, such as
<br />
a small number of weeks, and if it's still under discussion at that time
<br />
(i.e. hasn't been rejected or accepted yet), it would be allowed to use it in
<br />
the standard_name attribute, prefixed by &quot;proposed&quot; e.g.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;standard_name=&quot;proposed: mass_concentration_of_alcohol_in_beer&quot;.
<br />
That means, as others have said, that the record of proposed names and their
<br />
eventual fate would have to be maintained indefinitely, but this should be
<br />
easier to manage if there's just one such repository - a central CF one - than
<br />
many separate project websites.
<br />
<br />With such a system, it worries me that some projects might propose standard
<br />
names and start to use them without making a serious effort to agree them as
<br />
standard. I think that effort is well worthwhile, in terms of clarifying both
<br />
the concepts and the vocabulary.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
