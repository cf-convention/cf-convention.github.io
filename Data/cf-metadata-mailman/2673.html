<br />
Dear all,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first of all let me say that I truely appreciate the careful
<br />
discussion my proposal has initiated. This indeed is probably the most
<br />
convincing reason why CF has been accepted already in several parts of
<br />
the community.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve made a very nice distinction to clarify what my suggestion of
<br />
&lt;project&gt;_standard_names was really about. In fact it really had
<br />
elements of his (1) and (2) approaches. Let me re-iterate on both of
<br />
them:
<br />
<br />(1) for the process of defining new standard names, I believe the
<br />
suggestions that were made all point into the right direction.
<br />
Personally, I like the standard_name: &quot;proposed: ....&quot; approach. Any
<br />
tool could then easily test if the string behind &quot;proposed&quot; exists in
<br />
the current standard_name table or not. If it doesn't, a warning occurs
<br />
but no error. Hence, no modification would be required to any existing
<br />
data set, albeit these files could be upgraded by removing the
<br />
&quot;proposed&quot; string once the name has been accepted. I also see the point
<br />
that communities should enhance their efforts to have names defined
<br />
before running their experiments. However, practical experience rarely
<br />
allows for this and we can only hope that over time there will be enough
<br />
standard names available to cover almost all aspects of such experiments
<br />
(in the atmospheric chemistry domain we have already come quite far
<br />
now).
<br />
<br />(2) the &quot;private&quot; name space was more central to my suggestion. Steve
<br />
made cautioning comments about the development of non-standard GRIB
<br />
tables, and indeed these are a great pain. However, there is a
<br />
fundamental difference here in that netcdf files will always be amenable
<br />
to at least some interpretation provided that &quot;good&quot; metadata is
<br />
provided, while one is completely lost with a GRIB file if the code
<br />
table cannot be found (we experienced this the hard way when we first
<br />
added chemical species into the ECHAM model).
<br />
<br />The discussion so far has viewed my proposal mainly from the CF
<br />
perspective. I would like to invite you again to take the view of the
<br />
project coordinator for a minute. Experience shows that about 95% or
<br />
more of the preparations for new experiments go into scientific
<br />
validation of the model and making sure it runs at all and hopefully
<br />
reasonably efficient. Then someone at a meeting gets up and displays a
<br />
long list of seemingly glibberish semantic phrases which are to be
<br />
proposed as standard names in some weird &quot;convention&quot;. Typically this
<br />
presentation is given during the last 5 minutes of a meeting and 50% of
<br />
the audience have already left for the airport. Consequently, the
<br />
coordinator (or some nice fellow supporting him/her) has to deal with
<br />
this standardisation on his/her own (while at the same time preparing
<br />
their own model). Finally, a proposal for new standard names is
<br />
submitted and by the time the discussion is over 30% have passed
<br />
unaltered, 60% require modification and 10% are rejected. At that point
<br />
in time most model runs have been submitted. Now: what do you do? I
<br />
guess each and every one of these coordinating fellows/fellas will be
<br />
happy if he/she can assure that all data in the archive are not
<br />
corrupted, the models have worked and the analysis that was planned can
<br />
be performed. Proper archiving and interoperability (still) come as an
<br />
afterthought. [I only hope this doesn't sound too negative, I may have
<br />
been watching too much cabaret lately ;-)]
<br />
<br />-- back to the actual suggestion: what I wanted to express with my
<br />
proposal is that we should find a way to acknowledge that someone has
<br />
tried to establish new standard names while at the same time the &quot;pure&quot;
<br />
standard should not be corrupted. The proposal of using &quot;proposed:&quot;
<br />
actually captures this very nicely. By the same token we could even go
<br />
as far as to allow the keyword &quot;private:&quot; in the standard_name string
<br />
(instead of defining a new &lt;project&gt;_standard_name). Yes: it does to
<br />
some extent weaken the stringency of a standard_name, but only on the
<br />
surface. In reality I believe such qualifiers could even strengthen the
<br />
concept. We could require that a &quot;project&quot; attribute must be part of the
<br />
global attributes if the &quot;private&quot; qualifier is used and the project
<br />
attribute must point to a web resource where information on the project
<br />
is given (perhaps one could even think of a central &quot;project&quot; database
<br />
with a simple registration process to make eternity easier to achieve).
<br />
As project manager you may be glad to surf on the well-designed concept
<br />
that CF and the standard names provide and there is currently no
<br />
standardized way to do this. By allowing such qualifier keywords to the
<br />
standard_name attribute, nothing would change in terms of &quot;official&quot;
<br />
standards (as these are the standard_names without any qualifier) while
<br />
it would become a lot easier for newcomers and other groups to take
<br />
advantage of the concept. In effect this would be a neat way to address
<br />
the needs both of the operational community, where it is very important
<br />
to rely on the long lifetime of a name and of the &quot;experimental&quot;
<br />
community, which needs flexibility more than anything else, but where
<br />
interoperability can also play a very important role in the future.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />Martin
