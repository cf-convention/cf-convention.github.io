Dear Jonathan, John G. and John D.,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your discussion of the surface_carbon_dioxide_mole_flux name:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6) surface_carbon_dioxide_mole_flux
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have agreed that this existing name is ambiguous as to its sign
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convention and we think that it has generally been used as an upward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flux into the atmosphere. We have also agreed that it would be useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define fluxes in both directions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jonathan has suggested making the existing name an alias of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_upward_mole_flux_of_carbon_dioxide. I am uncomfortable about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opting to add one specific direction to this name, which effectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes (narrows) its definition, when we can't be certain how it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been used in the past. I suggest adding two new names of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_upward_mole_flux_of_carbon_dioxide and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_downward_mole_flux_of_carbon_dioxide and making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_carbon_dioxide_mole_flux an alias of both.  That way, any data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written in the future will be unambiguous but we won't be imposing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (possibly) incorrect interpretation onto older data.  What do others
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think?
</em><br />
<br />I think we've now agreed on creating the two new names and making the
<br />
older name an alias of both.  This will be done at the next update of
<br />
the standard name table.
<br />
<br />The discussion of this point has prompted me to review exactly what the
<br />
current CF document says about aliases and how we are using them in
<br />
practice in version 14 of the standard name table. Some of the issues
<br />
are quite subtle, but I believe that we are using aliases in a manner
<br />
consistent with the spirit of the conventions document.
<br />
<br />The purpose of aliases is to provide a way of deprecating
<br />
standard_names.  This is discussed in CF 1.4, Appendix B which describes
<br />
the XML schema of the standard name table:
<br />
<br />&quot;The purpose of the alias elements are to provide a means for
<br />
maintaining the table in a backwards compatible fashion. For example, if
<br />
more than one id string was found to correspond to identical
<br />
definitions, then the redundant definitions can be converted into
<br />
aliases. It is not intended that the alias elements be used to
<br />
accommodate the use of local naming conventions in the standard_name
<br />
attribute strings.&quot;
<br />
<br />Clearly this is not an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which
<br />
aliases can be (and are) used, but I don't think it restricts the
<br />
relationship between standard names and aliases to be solely one-to-one
<br />
mappings.
<br />
<br />I think it is important to reiterate that once a standard name is added
<br />
to the standard name table, the string that is chosen will remain in the
<br />
table in perpetuity, either as a current standard name or as an alias.
<br />
All are listed in the table along with the appropriate canonical units
<br />
and (usually) a description/definition.
<br />
<br />Generally speaking, an alias is created if it becomes apparent that the
<br />
string originally chosen to be the standard name of a quantity is
<br />
ambiguous, inappropriate or incorrect in some other way (e.g., a
<br />
spelling mistake or a typo).  Under these circumstances a new standard
<br />
name is chosen to represent the defined quantity.  The older string is
<br />
then made an alias of the new standard name and is listed as such in the
<br />
table entry for the name.  In this way both versions of the name
<br />
continue to be associated with the same units and definition and only
<br />
the name itself changes.  Older data written using the alias will remain
<br />
valid CF and will retain the same units and definition information, and
<br />
new data should be written with the new standard name. A current
<br />
standard name may be mapped to zero, one, or more, aliases.  Most
<br />
current names have no alias. Many have just one, e.g., the current name
<br />
mass_fraction_of_ozone_in_air has an alias of
<br />
mass_fraction_of_o3_in_air. The quantity with standard name
<br />
lagrangian_tendency_of_air_pressure was previously known first as
<br />
'omega', then as '
<br />
vertical_air_velocity_expressed_as_tendency_of_pressure' so the current
<br />
name has two aliases.
<br />
<br />It is of fundamental importance that the meaning of a standard name does
<br />
not change even when the name itself changes because to do so risks
<br />
altering the interpretation of existing data.  This does not necessarily
<br />
mean that the definition text will never be modified, but modifications
<br />
will only be made to improve clarity and make the quantity easier to
<br />
understand, not to change the interpretation. Sometimes I make this type
<br />
of modification to a definition even when no alias is being introduced.
<br />
When an alias is being introduced there are three circumstances that
<br />
would require some adjustment to the definition text:
<br />
1) The name itself is mentioned in the definition - in this case I would
<br />
change the text to reflect the (new) current name.
<br />
2) The new name employs one of the common standard name 'phrases' that
<br />
didn't occur in the older version - I would add the standard text that
<br />
explains that phrase to the definition (although I can't recall ever
<br />
needing to do this in practice).
<br />
3) The mapping being created between a standard name and an alias
<br />
broadens or narrows the usage of the name.  I can think of two examples
<br />
of this:
<br />
&nbsp;a) the aliases we have just agreed for the surface carbon dioxide
<br />
fluxes in which two more specific names are being introduced to remove
<br />
ambiguity in the original. Each new name will have its own separate
<br />
definition, and the two definitions will differ only in the sign
<br />
convention.  We have agreed that it would be a mistake to impose one or
<br />
other sign convention on existing data, hence the only available
<br />
solution is to create the same alias for both names. The definitions
<br />
will refer to one another and will both explain that data written with
<br />
the deprecated &quot;unsigned&quot; name needs to be examined carefully to
<br />
determine which convention was used.
<br />
b) aliases that were created from the old &quot;where&quot; names as a result of
<br />
agreeing trac ticket 17.  It was agreed that instead of including a
<br />
description of surface type in the standard name we would supply that
<br />
information via cell_methods and (optionally) string valued coordinate
<br />
variables.  The aliases created were:
<br />
precipitation_flux_onto_canopy (alias
<br />
precipitation_flux_onto_canopy_where_land)
<br />
surface_net_downward_radiative_flux (alias
<br />
surface_net_downward_radiative_flux_where_land)
<br />
surface_snow_thickness (alias surface_snow_thickness_where_sea_ice)
<br />
surface_temperature (aliases surface_temperature_where_land,
<br />
surface_temperature_where_open_sea, surface_temperature_where_snow)
<br />
surface_upward_sensible_heat_flux (alias
<br />
surface_upward_sensible_heat_flux_where_sea)
<br />
water_evaporation_amount_from_canopy (alias
<br />
water_evaporation_amount_from_canopy_where_land)
<br />
water_evaporation_flux (alias water_evaporation_flux_where_sea_ice)
<br />
water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy (alias
<br />
water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy_where_land)
<br />
area_type (aliases land_cover, surface_cover).
<br />
We needed to create these aliases because the CF conventions were
<br />
modified and the basic geophysical quantities are the same, regardless
<br />
of the underlying surface type. The current names are all somewhat
<br />
broader in scope than their aliases but I added sentences to all the
<br />
definitions to explain how older data employing the 'where' phrase
<br />
should be interpreted, thus preserving the meaning of those data.
<br />
<br />This seems like a lot of detail about one small corner of the
<br />
conventions but I thought it would be useful to write it down so as to
<br />
be clear about how the aliases are being used and, in particular, how
<br />
they interact with the definitions. Perhaps it would be helpful to
<br />
incorporate some of the above into section 3.3 of the CF document to
<br />
give a more complete description of the purpose and use of aliases.  I
<br />
would be willing to create the necessary trac ticket if anyone else
<br />
thinks it would be worthwhile.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
