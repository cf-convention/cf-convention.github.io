<br />
Dear Jonathan and Siobhan,
<br />
<br />Thank you both for your comments on the cryosphere proposals.  I am
<br />
happy to take your latest comments into account as it is important to
<br />
try to get these names right before they are added to the table.  Karl
<br />
had also sent me some comments via email during August, which
<br />
unfortunately I had failed to include in my earlier posting.  This email
<br />
is intended to summarize the current position on all the cryosphere
<br />
names.
<br />
<br />Firstly, the following names have not been the subject of any further
<br />
discussion and they remain accepted for inclusion in the standard name
<br />
table as per my posting of 13th September:
<br />
<br />heat_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_freezing_of_frazil_ice; Wm-2
<br />
age_of_surface_snow; day
<br />
permafrost_layer_thickness; m
<br />
liquid_water_content_of_permafrost_layer; kg m-2
<br />
sea_ice_and_surface_snow_amount; kg m-2
<br />
sea_ice_salinity; psu
<br />
age_of_sea_ice; year
<br />
tendency_of_sea_ice_amount_due_to_frazil_ice_accumulation_in_leads;
<br />
kgm-2 s-1
<br />
tendency_of_sea_ice_amount_due_to_congelation_ice_accumulation; kg m-2
<br />
s-1
<br />
tendency_of_sea_ice_amount_due_to_snow_conversion; kg m-2 s-1
<br />
tendency_of_surface_snow_melt_amount; kg m-2 s-1
<br />
tendency_of_sea_ice_amount_due_to_surface_melting; kg m-2 s-1
<br />
tendency_of_sea_ice_amount_due_to_basal_melting; kg m-2 s-1
<br />
sea_ice_x_transport; kg s-1
<br />
sea_ice_y_transport; kg s-1
<br />
compressive_strength_of_sea_ice; Pa m
<br />
sea_water_transport_across_line; kg s-1.
<br />
<br />The names still under discussion are dealt with in the following.
<br />
<br />1. surface_downward_heat_flux_in_snow; Wm-2
<br />
<br />Alison wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This quantity has the CMIP5 standard name of 'Downward Heat Flux into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Snow Where Land over Land' and is accompanied by the following
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Compute the net downward heat flux from the atmosphere into the snow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that lies on land divided by the land area in the grid cell; report as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0.0 for snow-free land regions or where the land fraction is 0.'  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation seems to indicate that we are talking about the heat flux
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the interface between atmosphere and snow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We already have the standard name surface_downward_heat_flux_in_air
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is defined as follows: 'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;Downward&quot; indicates a vector
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The vertical heat flux in air is the sum of all heat fluxes i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; radiative, latent and sensible. In accordance with common usage in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; density&quot; in physics.' I think this is actually the same quantity,
</em><br />
which
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means that we wouldn't need to introduce a new name for snow surface
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heat flux.  The 'Snow Where Land over Land' part of the CMIP5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belongs in the cell_methods attribute so it doesn't necessitate a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard name. I think, however, that we will need to introduce a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entry of land_snow (similar to land_ice) into the area_type table.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is true that we also have an existing standard name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_downward_heat_flux_in_sea_water.  However, in previous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussions of surface sea water quantities we have established that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these names generally refer to the top level of the ocean model rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the actual interface between atmosphere and ocean.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_downward_heat_flux_in_snow refers to a layer in a snow model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then perhaps we do need a separate name, but if it refers to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atmosphere/snow interface then I think we don't.
</em><br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there is a need to have distinct surface heat fluxes in the
</em><br />
media on either side of the surface because there might
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a phase change going on actually at the interface, so there would
</em><br />
then be a vertical divergence in heat flux at the interface.
<br />
<br />Siobhan (via email) wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Alison you raise 3 other points, I agree with Jonathans responses
</em><br />
below, on the 17th from the archive,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though the fact there already is downward radiation in snow for the
</em><br />
land surface already may mean that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same 'cf name can apply'. Though one could have a fraction land
</em><br />
surface cover in the model grid box so
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would be necessary to have a variable to distinguish it for the ice
</em><br />
part of the grid box.
<br />
<br />Thank you for these comments, I understand this quantity now and agree
<br />
that the heat_flux_in_air name is not appropriate. Therefore, I think we
<br />
should introduce a new standard name of
<br />
surface_downward_heat_flux_in_snow (Wm-2). The CMIP5 output can then use
<br />
a cell_methods of &quot;area: mean where land&quot;.  OK?
<br />

<br />
2. sea_ice_surface_temperature; K
<br />
<br />Alison wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The CMIP5 long_name for this quantity is 'Temperature at Interface
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Between Sea Ice and Snow'. I would like to amend my suggestion for
</em><br />
this
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; name to be temperature_at_interface_between_sea_ice_and_snow which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think makes the meaning clearer and far less likely to be confused
</em><br />
with
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea ice temperature at the interface with the atmosphere (which is
</em><br />
just
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_temperature).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I prefer your original suggestion, because there might not be
</em><br />
any snow. If all the snow melts,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your new quantity seems to become meaningless. However, the
</em><br />
sea_ice_surface_temperature still exists,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and is identical with the surface_temperature.
</em><br />
<br />Siobhan (via email) agreed with Jonathan's view.
<br />
<br />Karl (via email) sent the following comment:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;surface temperature&quot; would normally represent the average surface
</em><br />
temperature over all portions of the grid cell, not just the sea ice
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; portion.
</em><br />
<br />I must admit that I'm becoming rather confused about sea ice surface
<br />
temperatures in the CMIP5 output.  There are actually two distinct
<br />
quantities requested in the CMIP5 document:
<br />
(a) Long name 'Surface Temperature of Sea Ice' with units of K and the
<br />
following explanatory comments: 'When computing the time-mean here, the
<br />
time-samples, weighted by the area of sea ice in the grid cell, are
<br />
accumulated and then divided by the sum of the weights.  Report as
<br />
&quot;missing&quot; in regions free of sea ice.  Note this will be the surface
<br />
snow temperature in regions where snow covers the sea ice.' Originally I
<br />
suggested using the existing name of surface_temperature for this
<br />
quantity.
<br />
(b) Long name 'Temperature at Interface Between Sea Ice and Snow' with
<br />
units of K and the following explanatory comments: 'When computing the
<br />
time-mean here, the time-samples, weighted by the area of snow-covered
<br />
sea ice in the grid cell, are accumulated and then divided by the sum of
<br />
the weights.  Report as &quot;missing&quot; in regions free of snow-covered sea
<br />
ice.'
<br />
<br />I think that Karl's comment refers to (a) while the other comments refer
<br />
to (b).  Clearly the two quantities are closely related and we need to
<br />
make the proper distinction between them.
<br />
<br />I think that (a) should in fact be called 'sea_ice_surface_temperature'
<br />
and it would have the following definition: 'The surface called
<br />
&quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The surface
<br />
temperature is the temperature at the interface, not the bulk
<br />
temperature of the medium above or below.' As Jonathan points out, this
<br />
would be identical with surface_temperature but limited to only the
<br />
sea_ice bit of the grid box. I think then that a cell_methods of &quot;time:
<br />
mean&quot; would suffice for the time processing.
<br />
<br />Jonathan points out that my suggestion of
<br />
temperature_at_interface_between_sea_ice_and_snow becomes meaningless
<br />
when there is sea-ice with no snow, but it seems to me that that is
<br />
exactly what the CMIP5 document is asking for in (b). The cell_methods
<br />
could then also be &quot;time: mean&quot;.
<br />
<br />Does this make sense to others?
<br />
<br />3. sea_ice_transport OR sea_ice_transport_across_line; kg s-1
<br />
<br />Alison wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The CMIP5 output document asks for 'Sea Ice Mass Transport Through
</em><br />
Fram
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Strait'.  We already have the standard name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea_ice_transport_across_line defined as 'Transport across_line means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that which crosses a particular line on the Earth's surface; formally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this means the integral along the line of the normal component of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transport.' I am not sure how the Fram Strait transport is defined -
</em><br />
is
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it calculated along a notional line or do we need a more general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity?
</em><br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think sea_ice_transport_across_line is sufficiently general. Any
</em><br />
application which wants to use it will
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to define the line. The exact definition of the line across the
</em><br />
Fram Strait in a model will be model-dependent,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the idea is well defined.
</em><br />
<br />Siobhan (via email) has agreed with Jonathan's view so we will use the
<br />
existing name of sea_ice_transport_across_line for this quantity.
<br />
<br />4. Shear quantity.
<br />
<br />I proposed shear_of_sea_ice_velocity; s-1.
<br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I commented this week on &quot;shear&quot;. I was wrong to suggest that sea ice
</em><br />
shear is like wind speed shear, because the latter is the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vertical Derivative of a horizontal speed, whereas sea ice shear is (I
</em><br />
think) a horizontal derivative of a horizontal velocity
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or speed.I wonder what the quantity required is symbolically? Is it
</em><br />
du/dy or dv/dx? These, I think, are two distinct components of a tensor,
<br />
but
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I might be wrong.
</em><br />
<br />Siobhan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The shear I was referring to was the shear component in the tensor  of
</em><br />
strain rate, like divergence has two components.
<br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are these components defined wrt grid directions or wrt true E and N?
</em><br />
If the latter, we could call them
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eastward_shear_of_northward_sea_ice_velocity (dv/dx) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; northward_shear_of_eastward_sea_ice_velocity (du/dy).
</em><br />
<br />and later wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That probably wouldn't be clear, would it, because &quot;eastward shear&quot; is
</em><br />
likely to mean du/dy. Even more explicitly,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we could avoid shear at all and call them
</em><br />
eastward_derivative_of_northward_sea_ice_velocity and v-v.
<br />
<br />Siobhan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think eastward_derivative_of_northward_sea_ice_velocity and v-v
</em><br />
would probably be best cf long name
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and use shear in any longer verbal description in case anyone is
</em><br />
confused.
<br />
<br />Thank you for the discussion of these names.  It seems that we are
<br />
agreed on two new quantities:
<br />
eastward_derivative_of_northward_sea_ice_velocity; s-1
<br />
northward_derivative_of_eastward_sea_ice_velocity; s-1.
<br />
These names are accepted for inclusion in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />5. Ridging quantity.
<br />
<br />Alison wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps the name should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tendency_of_fractional_growth_in_ice_volume_due_to_ridging or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tendency_of_fractional_growth_in_ice_area_due_to_ridging.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think we need to call the quantity a tendency because that is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; term we normally use in standard names to mean the time rate of
</em><br />
change.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

be called

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   tendency_of_sea_ice_area_fraction_due_to_ridging

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is a contribution to (or perhaps identical with) the existing
</em><br />
quantity
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  tendency_of_sea_ice_area_fraction_due_to_dynamics
</em><br />
<br />Siobhan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am happy with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Calling the ridging rate a tendency, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   tendency_of_sea_ice_area_fraction_due_to_ridging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is a contribution to  the existing quantity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  tendency_of_sea_ice_area_fraction_due_to_dynamics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be fine.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you for the discussion.  I think we are agreed on
<br />
tendency_of_sea_ice_area_fraction_due_to_ridging; s-1.  This name is
<br />
accepted for inclusion in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />6. Water flux names
<br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; water_flux_into_sea_ice_from_rain; kg m-2 s-1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; water_flux_into_sea_ice_from_snow; kg m-2 s-1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I wouldn't be sure what that means - is it a flux of water that
</em><br />
percolates into the sea ice?
<br />
<br />That is a good question - the phase of the water being added to the sea
<br />
ice isn't clear.  Looking back at the CMIP5 document, these two
<br />
quantities are listed as:
<br />
(a) A long name of 'Surface Rainfall Rate into the Sea Ice Portion of
<br />
the Grid Cell' with units kg m-2 s-1 and explanatory text: 'where sea
<br />
ice over sea: compute the the water mass per unit time falling as rain
<br />
onto the sea ice portion of a grid cell divided by the area of the ocean
<br />
portion of the grid cell (including both ice-free and sea-ice covered
<br />
fractions).  Report as 0. in regions free of sea ice.'
<br />
(b) A long name of 'Surface Snowfall Rate into the Sea Ice Portion of
<br />
the Grid Cell' with units of kg m-2 s-1 and explanatory text: ' where
<br />
sea ice over sea: compute the the water mass per unit time falling as
<br />
snow onto the sea ice portion of a grid cell divided by the area of the
<br />
ocean portion of the grid cell (including both ice-free and sea-ice
<br />
covered fractions).  Report as 0. in regions free of sea ice.'
<br />
<br />I called them fluxes rather than rates because of the units (rates
<br />
should have units of m s-1).  On reflection, I think we should use the
<br />
existing standard names of
<br />
rainfall_flux; kg m-2 s-1
<br />
snowfall_flux; kg m-2 s-1
<br />
and supply a cell_methods attribute of &quot;area: mean where sea_ice over
<br />
sea&quot; for each of them.  Does that seem more sensible?
<br />
<br />7. Lateral sea ice growth
<br />
<br />I proposed
<br />
tendency_of_sea_ice_amount_due_to_lateral_growth_of_ice_sheet; kg m-2
<br />
s-1
<br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;ice_sheet&quot; is not a good phrase to use, as it usually refers to land
</em><br />
ice, not sea ice. Perhaps &quot;ice_floes&quot; would be better.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I'm happy with ice_floes - does Siobhan agree?
<br />
<br />8. Sea ice thermal energy
<br />
<br />I proposed 
<br />
sea_ice_thermal_energy; J
<br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sea_ice_thermal_energy; J
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it really J, not J m-2? If J m-2, the phrase heat_content would be
</em><br />
better, as it would be consistent with the existing name
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
integral_of_sea_water_potential_temperature_wrt_depth_expressed_as_heat_
<br />
content
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (J m-2). If really J, I wonder if we can think of a phrase related to
</em><br />
heat_content. I am assuming that this quantity relates to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temperature, but maybe it relates to latent heat content? It would be
</em><br />
good to be clear about this in the name.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />According to the CMIP5 document, the unit is J and the long name is 'Sea
<br />
Ice Total Heat Content'. The explanation says, 'Ice at 0 Celsius is
<br />
assumed taken to have a heat content of 0 J.  When averaging over time,
<br />
this quantity is weighted by the mass of sea ice.   Report as &quot;missing&quot;
<br />
in regions free of snow on land.'
<br />
<br />I find this rather confusing - if it is supposed to be a sea ice
<br />
quantity, then surely it should always be reported as &quot;missing&quot; over
<br />
land and open sea.  It doesn't sound as though latent heat is included.
<br />
I don't think we can call it a 'content' because it isn't a quantity per
<br />
unit area. Perhaps Siobhan can help to clarify this quantity further.
<br />
<br />9.  Bare Sea Ice Albedo
<br />
<br />This was not in my original list of cryosphere proposals.  The CMIP5
<br />
output document asks for a quantity with long name of 'Bare Sea Ice
<br />
Albedo', units of '1' and explanation of 'Report as &quot;missing&quot; if there
<br />
is no sunlight or if a region is free of sea ice.' I had suggested to
<br />
Karl that, for the purposes of CMIP5, we could use the existing name of
<br />
surface_albedo_assuming_no_snow which is why I didn't propose a new name
<br />
for this quantity.
<br />
<br />Karl (via email) wrote: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;surface_albedo_assuming_no_snow&quot;   I think is not right.  I think
</em><br />
they 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want the albedo of (bare) sea ice only (i.e., ice without snow, but
</em><br />
also ignoring any other surface types in the grid cell (e.g., the open
<br />
water
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; portion).  &quot;surface_albedo&quot; I think refers to both the open ocean and
</em><br />
the sea ice portion, doesn't it?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />There is a question mark in the CMIP5 document as to whether this
<br />
quantity should be saved at all. In response to that, Siobhan wrote the
<br />
following:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was bothered that the bare sea ice albedo has been flagged for
</em><br />
removal, It probably should be total sea
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ice albedo, though in NCAR model bare ice albedo is changeable due to
</em><br />
black carbon and multi-scattering in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal layers.  There is a comment on the next page about getting
</em><br />
albedo from the downwelling and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; upwelling shortwave radiation, but this would not allow for the
</em><br />
penetration of shortwave radiation into the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ice.  My preference is for total sea ice albedo to be saved. This will
</em><br />
allows for the more sophisticate
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schemes to have an areal average of seasonal changes in albedos across
</em><br />
thickness categories, snow cover
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties, melt ponds and now aerosols effects to be analyzed, I
</em><br />
couldn't find surface albedo being
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saved elsewhere in the CMIP5  document.
</em><br />
<br />In view of Siobhan's comments I think there is definitely a need to
<br />
agree a name for this quantity.  I think that Karl is correct that
<br />
'surface_albedo' would normally refer to the whole grid cell.  It should
<br />
really be 'sea_ice_albedo'. We could introduce a new name of
<br />
'sea_ice_albedo_assuming_no_snow' but I'm not sure whether it is really
<br />
correct to use the &quot;assuming&quot; phrase here.  Perhaps it would be more
<br />
accurate to use the existing name 'sea_ice_albedo' and introduce a new
<br />
area_type of 'snow_free_ice'. I'd welcome opinions on this.
<br />
<br />10. X and y components of stress on sea ice surface and base
<br />
<br />These names were also not in my original list of proposals because,
<br />
again, I had thought we could use existing names for the quantities.
<br />
<br />The CMIP5 document asks for four quantities with long names and units as
<br />
follows:
<br />
X-Component of Atmospheric Stress On Sea Ice; Pa
<br />
Y-Component of Atmospheric Stress On Sea Ice; Pa
<br />
X-Component of Ocean Stress On Sea Ice; Pa
<br />
Y-Component of Ocean Stress On Sea Ice; Pa
<br />
All four quantities are accompanied by the same explanatory text: 'When
<br />
computing the time-mean here, the time samples, weighted by the area of
<br />
sea ice, are accumulated and then divided by the sum of the weights.
<br />
Report as &quot;missing&quot; in regions free of sea ice.'
<br />
<br />I suggested using the existing names:
<br />
surface_downward_eastward_stress
<br />
surface_downward_northward_stress
<br />
upward_eastward_stress_at_sea_ice_base
<br />
upward_northward_stress_at_sea_ice_base
<br />
<br />but Karl has pointed out that this is wrong:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The eastward and northward stresses can't be used because some models
</em><br />
will be reporting these on a grid not oriented with latitude and
<br />
longitude  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (we need to use x and y component standard names).
</em><br />
<br />I should have noticed this - sorry!
<br />
<br />We already have existing names
<br />
surface_downward_x_stress; Pa
<br />
surface_downward_y_stress; Pa
<br />
which we can use for the first two quantities.
<br />
<br />I now propose that we introduce two new standard names
<br />
upward_x_stress_at_sea_ice_base; Pa
<br />
upward_y_stress_at_sea_ice_base; Pa.
<br />
<br />I think also that for CMIP5 these four quantities should be accompanied
<br />
by a cell_methods attribute of &quot;area: mean where sea_ice&quot;.
<br />
<br />Is this OK?
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
