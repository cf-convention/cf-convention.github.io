<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent with ISO8601 in more than one way.  For example,

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be zero-padded and there must be a ?T? in between the date and time).
</em><br />
<br />If UDUNITS generally is more permissive than ISO8601 in what it accepts,
<br />
I would say this might be a good case for deprecating one form over the
<br />
other. I.e. if there were no (critical) incompatibilites between them,
<br />
and strict ISO8601 is still accepted by UDUNITS [1], then one could
<br />
deprecate any form which is NOT strictly ISO8601, yet still generally
<br />
allow or accept it as input. In this way:
<br />
<br />a) Existing CF data sets are still generally accessible.
<br />
<br />b) It is possibly a bit easier to implement parsing of these things in
<br />
clients that for some reason do not make use of the UDUNITS library.
<br />
(This is at the expense of not being able to read some legacy data
<br />
files, which may not be critical to that application.)
<br />
<br />c) We align with a more formal standard like ISO's is, compared to the
<br />
de facto one that UDUNITS represents.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Where is that UDUNITS time format documented anyway? I only found [2].)
<br />
<br />d) Easier to integrate with other system expecting or producing ISO8601.
<br />
<br /><br />If such a convention is accepted, then 1900-1-1 0:0:0 would be accepted
<br />
on input, but a validator tool would only accept a canonical form like
<br />
1900-01-01T00:00:00Z, which would also be the form that the library APIs
<br />
would produce.
<br />
<br />In the same manner one could also settle for only a _subset_ of ISO8601,
<br />
by reducing the number of alternatives and dropping support for features
<br />
that appears not to be applicable with CF. For example, always specify
<br />
as &quot;days since 2010-10-25&quot;, never &quot;days since 20101025&quot; or &quot;days since
<br />
2010W431&quot;. The rationale for such a decision could be that they aren't
<br />
_strictly_ necessary, and allowing them generally makes life more
<br />
complex for the ones who implement the reader software, thereby
<br />
generally acting as an impediment to data exchange.[3] In this case,
<br />
though, one should adopt the ISO-compliant variants if one finds that
<br />
any of them becomes applicable during a subsequent revision of CF.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is in addition to the different defaults to local time or UTC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (actually I guess this is a property of CF, not UDUNITS?)
</em><br />
<br />The timezone defaults is perhaps the only major &quot;incompatibility&quot;
<br />
between the two alternative? Is it &quot;major&quot; enough to warrant loosing the
<br />
advantages I have indicated? Is the following a viable solution, then?
<br />
<br />1) If formatted the &quot;UDUNITS way&quot;, defaults to UTC.
<br />
<br />2) If formatted the &quot;ISO8601 way&quot;, defaults to local timezone according
<br />
to ISO8601. Also, the special meaning of &quot;-00:00&quot; could apply.
<br />
<br />3) Recommended practice is to use the suffix &quot;Z&quot; with UTC times only.
<br />
Rationale: Facilitate data exchange and time-related processing across
<br />
as many software applications as possible.
<br />
<br /><br />An alternative to case 2 could be NOT to allow any &quot;default semantic&quot; at
<br />
all in that case. While being narrower than ISO8601 allows, this could
<br />
catch situations like &quot;forgot to specify&quot;. Since few probably have used
<br />
ISO8601-formatting already, maybe it wouldn't even break backwards
<br />
compatibility with existing data files? Another bonus: The receiver
<br />
wouldn't need to scratch his or her head figuring out exactly which
<br />
local zone was meant... :-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, it seems that it might be confusing to introduce two string
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representations of date/times into CF, even for metadata.  Are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there any important cases in which ISO8601 is more expressive than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDUNITS syntax, or could we stick to UDUNITS for everything?
</em><br />
<br />Well, besides the week-day &quot;expressiveness&quot; illustrated above, ISO8601
<br />
can indicate entire centuries (just &quot;20&quot; means the range of years from
<br />
2000 to 2099, I believe; &quot;poor resolution&quot; if you like, or maybe just
<br />
sufficient or more suitable for some cases).
<br />
<br />There are time durations and such, but those are perhaps sufficiently
<br />
supported in UDUNITS too? (Or by the combination of UDUNITS formats in
<br />
combination with multiple attributes in netCDF.)
<br />
<br />ISO8601 can express recurring time intervals, I don't think UDUNITS can.
<br />
But are they potentially needed in CF?
<br />
<br />There is some disagreement regarding dates before the Gregorian era
<br />
started in 1582. UDUNITS switches to Julian calendar and seems to be
<br />
able to support years back to 9999 BCE (&quot;-9999&quot;), although somewhat
<br />
ambigious (?) as to what the values &quot;-0&quot;, &quot;0&quot; and &quot;+0&quot; would mean--if at
<br />
all legal. ISO8601 is more clear, but in its strictest sense allows for
<br />
years outside 1582..9999 only &quot;by agreement of the partners in
<br />
information interchange&quot;. One might also argue that it is somewhat less
<br />
expressive (by not allowing a calendar change[4], for instance).
<br />
However, I must point out that the &quot;CF Convention&quot; might be just such an
<br />
excellent place to indicate the mutual agreement for extending the
<br />
supported dates to any desired range.[5]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Notes:
<br />
<br />[1] I don't think it actually is, but maybe it ought to in a future
<br />
revision of UDUNITS? It doesn't seem like a date like 2004-167, 20060101
<br />
or even 2010W431 would match, for instance.
<br />
<br />[2]

&lt;<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-2/udunits2lib.html#Time">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-2/udunits2lib.html#Time</a>&gt;
<br />
<br />[3] Adapting the formatting is generally trivial for the writer software
<br />
compared to the demands of implementing a robust reader, so putting a
<br />
bit more requirements on that end doesn't imply the same degree of
<br />
impediment.
<br />
<br />[4] On the other hand, what about expressing Julian dates after 1582 in
<br />
UDUNITS? The change didn't happen in 1582 in quite a lot of places, so
<br />
this is just a potential source of confusion especially for those that
<br />
need to represent a lot of historical dates.
<br />
<br />[5] ISO8601 section 4.1.2.4 &quot;Expanded representations&quot;. At least the
<br />
semantics are fairly clear, and with a fairly well-defined axis scale
<br />
for the time dimension common to all such cases.
