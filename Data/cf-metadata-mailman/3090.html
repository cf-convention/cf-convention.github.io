Dear Nan, Roy and Rich
<br />
<br />John Caron, Steve Hankin and I are working on the featureType proposal. I
<br />
think we'll publish a new draft soon. In the current version, timeSeries,
<br />
Profile and timeSeriesProfile are all distinguished. Personally I find it
<br />
helpful to define the featureTypes in terms of dimensionality:
<br />
<br />timeSeries: a series of data points at the same spatial location with
<br />
monotonically varying time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data(i,o)	x(i) y(i) z(i) t(i,o) 	   must have t coordinate
<br />
profile: an ordered set of data points along a vertical line at a fixed
<br />
horizontal position and fixed time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data(i,o)	x(i) y(i) z(i,o) t(i) 	   must have z coordinate
<br />
timeSeriesProfile: a series of profiles at the same horizontal position with
<br />
monotonically varying time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data(i,p,o)	x(i) y(i) z(i,p,o) t(i,p)  must have z and t coords
<br />
<br />Here, i is the subscript of the feature, and o and p are subscripts of the
<br />
elements within the feature. Thus, the ith timeSeries has single-valued x y
<br />
and z coords associated with it, and a set of t coords. However, x y and z are
<br />
all optional, so a single timeSeries feature could have a 2D location (x,y) or
<br />
a 3D location (x,y,z). The only coord it must have is time.
<br />
<br />The timeSeries from sensors at different depths could be contained in a single
<br />
data variable of the timeSeries feature type, each with its 3D location. But
<br />
that wouldn't indicate they were actually at the same (x,y) location, because
<br />
they'd all have different x and y coords (with the same values). For this, a
<br />
timeSeriesProfile would be better. A single feature of this type has single x
<br />
and y coords, a set of time coords t(p) and a set of depth coords z(p,o),
<br />
where p is the profile subscript and o the time subscript.  If the depths are
<br />
the same at all times, the depth coord can be just z(o).
<br />
<br />But I'm not sure that this addresses Nan's concern, &quot;There's a big difference
<br />
between a series of profiles at a single x-y location and a time series of
<br />
data taken at the same x-y location by different instruments at different
<br />
depths.&quot; Both of these can be written as a timeSeriesProfile, so they aren't
<br />
structurally different - unless the problem is that you would like each depth
<br />
to have its own set of times, which isn't allowed above? Please could you
<br />
say more to clarify the problem?
<br />
<br />In the current draft, the order of dimensions is not prescribed. It doesn't
<br />
matter which way round they are. Flexibility is needed because you might want
<br />
any one of them to be the netCDF unlimited dimension.
<br />
<br />However, in the current draft the featureType is a global attribute, not a
<br />
variable attribute. That is because John's software cannot currently deal with
<br />
files that mix feature types. Of course you could have a mixture of feature
<br />
types in the file, but you wouldn't be able to specify the featureType
<br />
attribute or to use the proposed conventions for incompletely filled and
<br />
ragged arrays. In the document we say that a future version of CF might allow
<br />
a different feature type for each data variable. Is this too restrictive? If
<br />
so, a possible way forward would be to allow this flexibility now, but
<br />
recognise that John's software, which at the moment is the only implementation
<br />
of the new conventions, will not be able to process all conforming files.
<br />
<br />Happy 2011
<br />
<br />Jonathan
