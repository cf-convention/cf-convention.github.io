<br />Is it? what varies here, the length of the year or the length of the 
<br />
day? if the length of the year is well defined (what is it here?), the 
<br />
1/365 years is well defined, and it very well may not be 24 hours. If if 
<br />
is, then why the heck do you not use &quot;days since&quot;?

</em><br />
<br />but which month? one with a defined number of hours, all the same, or 
<br />
one that varies depending on where in the calendar year the data is?
<br />
<br />As I read these, I'm quite confused -- I can certainly see why one might 
<br />
what to collect or store data at such frequencies, but that's not what 
<br />
the CF standard is about. It is about clearly defining the data when 
<br />
stored, transmitted and shared -- ALL of the above examples are ripe for 
<br />
confusion, and could just as easily be expressed as &quot;hours since&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;days since&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; months since 1960-01-01 calendar 360_days
</em><br />
<br />what is a &quot;calendar 360_day&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (just as a reminder -- it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important to us, no matter how many people write to say months are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless)
</em><br />
<br />I don't think any of us think months are meaningless -- simple that they 
<br />
are not a good choice for well-defined time durations.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that there are two cases:
<br />
<br />1) The data is defined on some kind of regular interval (or irregular, 
<br />
but on clearly defined points in the time continuum)  - in which case 
<br />
use an appropriate unit: seconds, hours, days. (days is open to debate, 
<br />
I suppose)
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />2) the data correspond to calendar months, i.e. monthly averaged data, 
<br />
etc -- a way to specify &quot;calendar unit&quot; makes sense: &quot;calendar months 
<br />
since 1989-01&quot;
<br />
<br />but using all these peculiar combination of units, so that the time 
<br />
variable can be: (1,2,3,4), rather than say, (0, 5, 10, 15) makes no 
<br />
sense to me.
<br />
<br />And is it used in any other context? If you have an instrument that is 
<br />
gathering data at 1/2hz, would you do:
<br />
<br />&quot;2 seconds since date-time&quot; then have your time variable be: (0,1,2,2)?
<br />
<br />I think not, you'd do:
<br />
<br />&quot;seconds since date-time&quot; and have your time variable be: (1,2,4,6)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, then you lose the semantics of a 3 month interval.  As Benno (sorry for spelling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your name wrong last time) showed, the semantics of the qualifier for x since have real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  meaning in climate datasets.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am looking at how hard that would be to support, but it does add
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perhaps unneeded complexity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it adds semantics of the time periods in question.
</em><br />
<br />The question is &quot;is the added information worth the added complexity?&quot;. 
<br />
Also, one of the goal of the CF standard is to make it easier to have 
<br />
client software that can easily work with data from a variety of data 
<br />
sets -- this kind of thing makes it harder, not easier. If you want to 
<br />
give the user some information about the data collection interval, put 
<br />
it in optional meta-data.
<br />
<br /><br />There is a lot of talk about udunits as the &quot;reference library&quot;, and 
<br />
while I do see the value of a reference library, I also think that we 
<br />
need to remember that:
<br />
<br />1) we can define a standard without a specific reference lib actually 
<br />
existing.
<br />
<br />2) not every one is going to use udunits -- which means that if we add 
<br />
all this complexity to the standard, we need to not only add a  bunch of 
<br />
code to handle it in udunits, but also everyone else that uses other 
<br />
libraries for units has to deal with it -- please don't make me write 
<br />
that code!
<br />
<br />I have no idea how anyone else handles time in their client code, but 
<br />
what I do is:
<br />
<br />- first convert the time access to date-time objects
<br />
- second -- convert to whatever I need to do with it.
<br />
<br />I do this so that my client code can be all the same, I don't have to 
<br />
deal with multiple units, reference dates, etc in most of my code.

<br />It's not clear to me that that is the intention, actually -- I htink it 
<br />
means that in some uses, and means &quot;1/12 of a year&quot; in others (even 
<br />
though year isn't clearly defined, either!)
<br />
<br />In fact, since udunits is the official reference lib,and it does define 
<br />
a month has being a specific length, I think current practice is the 
<br />
later use.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question before us is, does the fact that there are some existing

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;CF&quot; files that utilize these encodings, require that those encodings be

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalized into CF? It is hard to say &quot;no&quot; in such cases, because doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so creates inconvenience for our colleagues and their users.
</em><br />
<br />Sure, but a standrad is defeined as &quot;everything in current use&quot;, there 
<br />
isin't really much point in having it at all.
<br />
<br />I think my point above is relevant here:
<br />
<br />There are data sets that use &quot;months since date-time&quot; in existence. 
<br />
However, anyone using those data sets with the udunits lib is 
<br />
interpreting that data in a way that may not be what the data creator 
<br />
intended -- this is simply broken, It can not be enshrined as a standard.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We should look at each of these questions from the point of view of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity of the software *reading* the file.
