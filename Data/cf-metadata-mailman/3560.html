Hello Jonathon,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the word &quot;preformed&quot; in &quot;Preformed Salinity&quot; is the same use as in &quot;preformed nitrate&quot;, NO, and &quot;preformed phosphate&quot; PO.  The idea is to recover the conservative variable that would be present if there were no biogeochemistry.   The methods that we use probably subtract off some effects of geochemistry as well as of biogeochemistry, at least in the open ocean.  The aim in forming Preformed Salinity has been to subtract off from Absolute Salinity those contributions that have arisen from all types of prior non-conservative source terms.  These source terms are primarily biogeochemical, not geochemical, but it is possible that some contributions to seawater composition from geochemistry have been mixed up in our methods with those caused by biogeochemistry.  But really, this is an area of research in which there is presently only one world expert (Rich Pawlowicz), and the research area needs boosting so we can better answer such questions.  I'm sure this paragraph is more information than anyone <br />
wanted to know!  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preformed Salinity is a relatively new concept, first appearing in the following two papers, and in the TEOS-10 Manual.

<br />________________________________________________
<br />
<br />I don't disagree with your suggestion of adding the descriptor &quot;specific&quot; to indicate that these things are &quot;per unit mass&quot;.  
<br />
_______________________________________________
<br />
<br />As for what salinity is carried in existing ocean models, I think there is a clear definitive answer, namely Practical Salinity.  Why?  Because ocean models are initialized with Practical Salinity data and the equation of state has, for 30 years, been written in terms of Practical Salinity.  The fact that it is model output and not observed data should be clear from the metadata, yes?  
<br />
__________________________________________________
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add to a previous comment from me, I should point out that the software to calculate both Absolute Salinity and Preformed Salinity from Practical Salinity is available from www.TEOS-10.org in Matlab, Fortran (and C), and soon, Python.  All these are the same version 3.0 of the software.  
<br />
___________________________________________________
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that TEOS-10 uses upper case letters for 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative Temperature
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolute Salinity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preformed Salinity
<br />
to indicate specifically defined quantities.  Note also that Practical Salinity has always had upper case letters, while potential temperature has always been lower case, as has in-situ temperature.

Subject: Re: [CF-metadata] new TEOS-10 standard names
<br />
<br />Dear all
<br />
<br />I agree with Roy in his remark that &quot;the existing salinity Standard Name is a
<br />
much broader term than the TEOS-10 recommendations&quot;.
<br />
In some datasets, it may not be well-defined precisely which &quot;kind&quot; of salinity
<br />
we have. This is particularly the case for model datasets, since most ocean
<br />
models used for climate are not capable of distinguishing owing to the
<br />
approximations they make. (I note that CF and the standard name table began
<br />
as a convention for GCMs, and later expanded to accommodate observations.) We
<br />
cannot redefine the existing standard name because of the existing datasets and
<br />
because it is useful to have a &quot;generic&quot; name anyway.
<br />
<br />However it is fine both to keep this existing generic name and to define some 
<br />
new ones to make the distinction in new obs and model datasets where it is
<br />
appropriate, as proposed by Paul and Trevor. It is usual in CF to have a choice
<br />
of precision for different applications.
<br />
<br />On Paul's proposals, I have a couple of comments:
<br />
<br />sea_water_preformed_salinity
<br />
Definition: Preformed Salinity is a salinity variable that is designed to be as
<br />
conservative as possible, by removing the estimated biogeochemical influences
<br />
on the seawater composition from other forms of salinity.
<br />
<br />I assume this is a newly introduced term. I would say that it would be good
<br />
to be more informative. &quot;Preformed&quot; does not tell me what it is - it doesn't
<br />
suggest anything in particular to me as a non-expert. CF standard names do not
<br />
have to be the term in common use if we could be more self-explanatory.
<br />
Perhaps we could be more self-explanatory in this term with a phrase such as
<br />
assuming_no_biogeochemical_influence. But actually, I am unsure what that
<br />
means - could you explain a bit further? How can salinity not be influenced
<br />
by geochemistry, in particular? Please excuse my ignorance.
<br />
<br />sea_water_potential_enthalpy
<br />
Since this quantity is in J kg-1, I suggest that it should contain the word
<br />
&quot;specific&quot;. Omitting this might imply that it was an extensive quantity e.g.
<br />
an ocean integral. By analogy with the existing standard name
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;specific_kinetic_energy_of_sea_water
<br />
it might be best phrased as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;specific_potential_enthalpy_of_sea_water
<br />
The salinity quantities are by definition intensive and so &quot;specific&quot; is
<br />
not required.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
