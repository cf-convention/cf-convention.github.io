To follow on from Trevor's comments, most CMIP3-grade ocean models were initialised, at least in their pre-coupled ocean state from a variant of the World Ocean Atlas (WOA). Listed on the CMIP3 Climate Model Documentation, References, and Links webpages (<a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/model_documentation/ipcc_model_documentation.php">http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/model_documentation/ipcc_model_documentation.php</a>) these suggest that initialisation fields were sourced mostly from:
<br />
LEV82: Levitus (1982);
<br />
LEV94: Levitus et al., (1994), Levitus and Boyer (1994);
<br />
LEV98: Conkright et al.,(1999);
<br />
LEV: unspecified Levitus database
<br />
<br />Just selecting one model from the ~24 or so which comprise the CMIP3 suite, CNRM-CM3, under section 5 - Simulation Details indicates:
<br />
Picntrl/Run_1:
<br />
This preindustrial control simulation was initialized from a  coupled simulation of  a previous version of CNRM coupled model initialized an ocean at rest with temperature and salinity profiles specified from Levitus (1982) climatology, integrated for 30 years with a relaxation of surface temperature to the monthly mean Reynolds climatology for 1950.
<br />
<br />Subsequent runs are often then initialised from a previously completed spinup..
<br />
<br />So I think it is fair to say that most model fields are then a modelled version of practical salinity..
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />P

Subject: RE: [CF-metadata] new TEOS-10 standard names
<br />
<br />A couple of quick comments following on from Jonathan's post.
<br />
<br />(1) I know of at least 6 pre-TEOS-10 expressions for density used in models, with authors like
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fofonoff &amp; Millard,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cox,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackett &amp; McDougall,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McDougall et al.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackett et al.
<br />
and they are all written in terms of Practical Salinity.  I know of none used in ocean models
<br />
that use any other type of salinity (until TEOS-10 has come along).  So we can safely say that
<br />
ocean and climate models have had their sea water equations of state written in terms of Practical Salinity.
<br />
<br />(2)  The fact that a model variable drifts should not be a reason to use a different name for that variable.  For example, we do not change the name &quot;potential temperature&quot; to something else just because model temperatures are not perfect and they drift.
<br />

<br />
<br />Dear all
<br />
<br />I understand the need to be clear, with new standard names, which observational
<br />
quantity is being collected in future. I do not agree, however, that we should
<br />
make the plain &quot;salinity&quot; name an alias for something more precise. This is
<br />
partly because that might change the meaning of existing data, possibly
<br />
incorrectly as Trevor points out. Partly it is also because I think it is
<br />
quite possible that models, perhaps idealised, may be used in which it would
<br />
not be meaningful to be more precise than just &quot;salinity&quot;.
<br />
<br />Trevor argues that existing ocean models use practical salinity because (a)
<br />
they are initialised with observations of that and (b) they assume so in their
<br />
equation of state. I don't think (a) is necessarily so. In some cases, they
<br />
might not be initialised with observations, for instance in idealised
<br />
investigations of spin-up. Even when initialised from obs,
<br />
they will almost certainly drift to a less realistic state. I don't know enough
<br />
about it to be sure about (b). Unless we could be certain this is always the
<br />
case, I think plain &quot;salinity&quot; should be retained for possible use in models.
<br />
However, we could certainly recommend that models should use one of the new
<br />
more precise terms if definitely appropriate. This recommendation could be
<br />
included in the standard_name definition of plain &quot;salinity&quot;.
<br />
<br />I understand the existing standard name sea_water_temperature to mean in-situ
<br />
temperature, as it does for air temperature. This could be stated in the
<br />
definition.
<br />
<br />The purpose of standard names themselves is not to prescribe or recommend what
<br />
quantities people should store in netCDF files. It is to allow them to describe
<br />
with sufficient precision the quantities they have chosen to store, in order
<br />
to make it possible to decide which quantities from different datasets should
<br />
be regarded as comparable.
<br />
<br />Standard names are all in lower case, regardless of what case is used in
<br />
ordinary writing. This is for simplicity in matching strings. Case-sensitive
<br />
matching would inevitably trip people up and cause a nuisance when they got
<br />
it wrong.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
