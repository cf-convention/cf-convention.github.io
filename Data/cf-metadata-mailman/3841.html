Trevor,
<br />
<br />while I agree with all the arguments given below, I vote that we should 
<br />
additionally
<br />
use Reference Salinity in the Baltic. We need a salinity measure that is
<br />
expressed as a mass fraction, in contrast to psu, and that is calculated
<br />
straight forward from CTD conductivity readings. I would reserve the
<br />
term Absolute Salinity to values that include the salinity anomaly, but
<br />
for the majority of applications this anomaly correction is not relevant.
<br />
<br />While we will measure and archive Practical Salinity as everywhere
<br />
else in oceanography, S_R is a sufficiently good approximation of S_A
<br />
to express, say, the total salt content of the Baltic, or the vertical salt
<br />
transport across the halocline in papers or reports.

<br />
<br /><br />Hello Trevor,
<br />
<br />We're now all saying the same thing.  The important thing is that Alison 
<br />
gets new Standard Names into the system for practical_salinity , 
<br />
absolute_salinity and Knudsen_salinity (Jonathan: should it be Knudsen or 
<br />
knudsen?) in the next update so they are available for use for new data and 
<br />
for re-labelling legacy data by those with the inclination/resources to do 
<br />
so.
<br />
<br />We cannot physically stop further use of 'salinity' without causing issues 
<br />
for legacy data.  All we can do, as Jonathan stated is take steps to 
<br />
strongly discourage its use through appropriate wording in its definition.
<br />
<br />Hopefully, case closed!
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />
finalize this discussion.
<br />
<br />Dear All,
<br />
<br />I think that the reason that we are facing a dilemma is simply because the 
<br />
word &quot;salinity&quot; now stands for a variety of things.  That is, we have not 
<br />
been as careful with &quot;salinity&quot; as we now realize we should have been over 
<br />
the past 50 or 100 years.
<br />
<br />My understanding of oceanographic practice is that between the Knudsen 
<br />
equation of 1901 and the year 1978 any calculated &quot;salinity&quot; quantity would 
<br />
have tried to be Knudsen salinity, no matter if it was calculated via 
<br />
titration or via a conductivity measurement (as occurred in the 1960s and 
<br />
1970s).  Hence it is quite valid to call such an old data point a 
<br />
&quot;Knudsen_Salinity&quot;.  Note that we do not reserve a name for a particular 
<br />
measurement technique.  Hence, for example, the salinity out of a climate 
<br />
model is called &quot;Practical Salinity&quot; to date even though the value did not 
<br />
result from a conductivity measurement.  Also a value of &quot;Absolute Salinity&quot; 
<br />
is still absolute salinity no matter whether it was calculated from either 
<br />
of the two recommended methods.
<br />
<br />________________________________
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;SUGGESTED WAY FORWARD FOR CF-metadata
<br />
<br />So any new (&gt;=2010) data going into a data base should be labelled as either 
<br />
&quot;Knudsen Salinity&quot;, &quot;Practical Salinity&quot; or &quot;Absolute Salinity&quot;, and the 
<br />
name &quot;Salinity&quot; should most definitely not be available as an option for any 
<br />
new (&gt;=2010) data going into a data base, whether from a cruise, a mooring 
<br />
or from model output.  I think this is quite clear, yes?  I think there can 
<br />
be no argument about this, and to do otherwise would just cause confusion. 
<br />
Can you make this happen in CF-metadata Paul?  This is essentially what we 
<br />
are being instructed to do by IOC, IAPSO and SCOR, and it makes perfect 
<br />
sense.
<br />
<br />But what should we do about the data in data bases that is presently called 
<br />
&quot;salinity&quot;.  My suggestion now is that we just let this data sit there as 
<br />
is.  We leave it up to the individual researcher to interpret what this data 
<br />
is.  For example, in our research, Paul Barker and I get this data and 
<br />
interpret it as Knudsen Salinity if it was collected before 1st January 
<br />
1978, and Practical Salinity if it was collected on or after 1st January 
<br />
1978.
<br />
<br />________________________________
<br />
<br /><br />Can we all agree on the last two paragraphs, and can you, Paul Durack and 
<br />
Nan, make this happen?  Until we agree on this as a procedure, there is 
<br />
little point in worrying about the exact wording of the definitions of the 
<br />
variables.  Can we all get back to each other with what we think about the 
<br />
suggested way forward that I describe in the above two paragraphs?
<br />
<br />Roy, I think what I wrote above is possibly the same as what you are 
<br />
suggesting, but I'm not sure what some of the technical words that you use 
<br />
mean:- &quot;deprecate&quot;, &quot;Narrowmatches&quot;, etc.
<br />
<br />With best wishes,
<br />

<br />
<br />Hello Reiner/Trevor,
<br />
<br />I have no problem with introducing the term Knudsen salinity for salinities 
<br />
pre-dating PSS-78.  A question to Reiner is does the term just apply to 
<br />
salinity by evaporation/titration or is it equally applicable to salinity 
<br />
data obtained by the STDs and CTDs with home-grown conductivity to salinity 
<br />
algorithms in use before PSS-78 brought some order to the world?
<br />
<br />Note, that having a term for pre-78 data doesn't necessarily allow us to 
<br />
immediately deprecate the term 'salinity'.  There's a lot of data out there 
<br />
marked up with 'salinity'. Anyone any views on how such deprecation should 
<br />
be managed?  My vote would be to set up the new terms and modify the 
<br />
'salinity' definition in the next Standard Names update, map all the new 
<br />
terms as narrowMatches to old one and then deprecate 'salinity' in a future 
<br />
Standard Names update.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />
<br />Since the use of any &quot;salinity&quot; was discouraged in favour of chlorinity in
<br />
1940,
<br />
all archived pre-78 salinities should be Knudsen salinities, originally
<br />
calculated
<br />
from chlorinity by the Knudsen formula derived from the evaporation
<br />
experiments
<br />
of Soerensen in 1900.
<br />
<br />Knudsen salinity is consistent with PSS-78 at about S = 35 but deviates
<br />
systematically for brackish water, see our 2008 salinity paper in DSR.
<br />
<br />The term &quot;Knudsen salinity&quot; is well understood, I think.

<br /><br />Hello Roy,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You make a good point about the pre 1978 data.  Perhaps we need yet
<br />
another name, such as &quot;Pre78salinity&quot; to indicate that it was probably
<br />
obtained by chemical titration.  By introducing such a salinity will have
<br />
the advantage of reducing the present ambiguity which calls this older data
<br />
by the same name as Practical Salinity, namely &quot;salinity&quot;.

<br />
<br />Hello Trevor,
<br />
<br />I totally agree that we should stop using 'salinity' from now on.  I also
<br />
agree that virtually all post-1983 (not 1980: it took 5 years to get the
<br />
1978 Equation of State published by UNESCO) data labelled 'salinity' are in
<br />
fact 'practical_salinity'.  However, as an oceanographic data centre we have
<br />
salinity data going back to the early 1900s and other centres such as ICES
<br />
have data going back further than that. These have been determined by a
<br />
variety of methodologies but are mostly chemical titrations or a variety of
<br />
algorithmic determinations from conductivity that are significantly
<br />
different from the PSS-78 scale. Replacing 'salinity' by
<br />
'practical_salinity' re-labels these data, which I believe is wrong.
<br />
<br />We certainly need to get 'practical_salinity' names in place and alter the
<br />
definition for salinity to indicate that it means 'salt content by any
<br />
method' with wording to strongly discourage its use for post-1983 data
<br />
unless the data are known to be 'non-practical' (which exist: we have some).
<br />
We also need to explain to the community that unless they change the labels
<br />
on their data that are practical salinity from 'salinity' to
<br />
'practical_salinity' then their data will be regarded as useless for many
<br />
physical oceanographic applications.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />
<br />Dear all,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of repeating ourselves, because there are now (at least)
<br />
three different salinities, it is now ambiguous and confusing to call any
<br />
salinity &quot;Salinity&quot;.  The Announcement of TEOS-10 that is now appearing in
<br />
all 22 oceanographic journals specifically recommends that the use of the
<br />
word &quot;Salinity&quot; cease immediately, and that either the words &quot;Practical
<br />
Salinity&quot; or &quot;Absolute Salinity&quot; be used.  The reason of course is to
<br />
minimise ambiguity.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is where the community (including CF-metadata) will have to end
<br />
up:- we have been requested to do so by IOC, SCOR and IAPSO.  So we may as
<br />
well do it now, in my view.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that all ocean models run to date have used Practical Salinity as
<br />
their &quot;Salinity&quot; variable,, and all equations of state since 1980 have been
<br />
in terms of Practical Salinity.  So there is no slight-of-hand in calling
<br />
these variables &quot;Practical Salinity&quot;; rather it is just being specific as to
<br />
what this type of salinity always has been.  That is &quot;Practical Salinity&quot; is
<br />
simply the long-hand name of what we have been calling &quot;Salinity&quot; for 30
<br />
years.
