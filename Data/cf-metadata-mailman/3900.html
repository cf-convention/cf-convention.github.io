Now I *think* I mostly understand the problem - thanks for the summary
<br />
explanation, Jonathan, and apologies for the earlier missing-the-point :)
<br />
<br />However, I probably still need a bit more straightening out or have
<br />
missed the point again..  I'd be grateful to understand more about why
<br />
one needs a different (official?) standard_name for each different usage
<br />
of a single flag variable by multiple data variables?
<br />
<br />If it's for machine usage, the machine already knows that it's a flag
<br />
variable (because it has flag_meanings) and the machine already knows
<br />
the standard_name of the &quot;parent&quot; variable (because it's followed an
<br />
ancillary_variable in the parent).  It could then make the appropriate
<br />
inference of naming/meaning for the parent variable it's considering.
<br />
In this case, not having a standard_name seems appropriate (or just
<br />
having a generic one for humans and ignored by machines).
<br />
<br />If it's just for human (display) purposes, because a lot of software
<br />
uses standard_name, one could name the flags variable something fairly
<br />
generic (and non-standard) - e.g. &quot;sea_ice_flags&quot; would reasonably
<br />
reflect the usage of a bunch of flags that generally apply to multiple
<br />
sea ice variables.  Wanting to give specific standard_names to each
<br />
usage for display/human purposes is fine but both proposed solutions
<br />
probably break existing software.  Given that the meaning can already be
<br />
inferred, that seems quite a high cost if there are no other reasons.
<br />
<br />(use case 2) Upendra has a fair point on overheads of flag_meanings,
<br />
which seems to be a separate but related issue.  As a satellite data
<br />
person, the overhead is small for me and I'd thus weight the value of
<br />
breaking software to fix this relatively low, but I see that's different
<br />
for insitu or other small data.
<br />
<br />(use case 3) To conflate this further with another related issue,
<br />
there's also the nice possibility of using the same flags data storage
<br />
variable but with different flags_meanings for it in different usages.
<br />
For example, one might use bits 0, 1, 2, 3 for sea_ice_x_displacement
<br />
and bits 0, 1, 4, 5 for sea_ice_y_displacement.  That seems a small but
<br />
genuine advance in machine understandable use of the flags - the machine
<br />
usage described above would presume that all flags have some useful
<br />
meaning for the parent variable while this would allow one to be
<br />
specific about which bits mattered.  This isn't possible with either
<br />
proposal, but #2 could be extended to be fully generic and cover it.
<br />
I'll put that in another email as this is already way too long and I
<br />
suspect it's unworkable ;)

<br />This may break existing software that relies on standard_name holding a

single value (presumably all software?), but primarily it will only
<br />
break the correct naming of the variables with multiple standard_names.
<br />
&nbsp;However, it seems only to cater for naming convenience rather than
<br />
adding any real semantic meaning, as most of the meaning can be inferred.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and flag_meanings attributes to be attached to a separate container variable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that can be pointed to by all the data variables.
</em><br />
<br />This will only break existing software that deals with flags (this
<br />
definitely exists for satellite data).  The old software will be
<br />
incapable of using the new-style flag variables as it won't be able to
<br />
find the necessary elements.  Other software should be ok.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />Mike.
<br />
<br />P.S. I'm assuming it's not proposed to add a lot of flags names to the
<br />
standard table, because there'd be a lot of names and the usage/meaning
<br />
isn't standard.  One could have a general rule of a derivative &quot;_flags&quot;
<br />
being allowed for any standard_name, but this doesn't really advance
<br />
machine understanding (see above) and is presumably just for display /
<br />
validation-passing.
