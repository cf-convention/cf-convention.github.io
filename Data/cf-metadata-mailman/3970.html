<br />
Thanks for all your work getting this fairly scattered discussion into a
<br />
submittable shape Alison!
<br />
<br />I've supplemented your comments with some additional descriptive text
<br />
below. I have additionally added a &quot;References:&quot; attribute for each of
<br />
these proposed variables if applicable, I am not sure whether the format
<br />
of the current standard_names table can deal with this suggestion?
<br />
<br />The new proposed name sea_water_cox_salinity has also been added (this is
<br />
a new one).
<br />
<br />I am also wondering if while we're trying to tidy up this all, if we
<br />
propose the &quot;units&quot;: &quot;PSS-78&quot;, &quot;ppt&quot; and &quot;psu&quot; to become part of an update
<br />
to the udunits codebase? I am not sure how we would go about this
<br />
however.. It seems arbitrary that we continue to use the canonical units
<br />
of 1e-3 for salinity, as you note we currently scale this. A nice thing
<br />
with TEOS-10 is that we get back units, so g kg-1 rather than the ratio of
<br />
the past, however I would note that regardless of the notation it's still
<br />
1e-3.. I apologise below my units are a little all over the place..
<br />
<br />I have also rearranged the name of &quot;specific_enthalpy&quot; to
<br />
sea_water_specific.. I think it is better to maintain the convention of
<br />
sea_water_X, as this then lists together when viewing the entire table
<br />
alphabetically..
<br />
<br />As noted below I believe that 5 of the 8 proposed new names would benefit
<br />
from a change_over_time_in_X name too, and the notation you have proposed
<br />
with the ...&quot;change_over_time_in_X&quot; means change in a quantity X... Seems
<br />
reasonable to me.
<br />
<br />I have appended my suggested edits below.. If anyone notes any issues
<br />
below, please fix and resubmit this..
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />P

Add PSS-78, ppt &amp; psu to udunits ? provide request info to Unidata?
<br />
<br />sea_water_salinity
<br />
Definition: The standard name sea_water_salinity is the salt content of
<br />
sea water normally on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and
<br />
is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water in
<br />
observations since the 1960s. There are standard names for the more
<br />
precisely defined salinity quantities sea_water_knudsen_salinity
<br />
(1901-1966), sea_water_cox_salinity (1967-1977),
<br />
sea_water_practical_salinity (1978-present day),
<br />
sea_water_absolute_salinity and sea_water_preformed_salinity. The more
<br />
precise standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled
<br />
and observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to
<br />
describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in
<br />
favour of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity
<br />
quantity stored by national data centres for post-1978 observations. The
<br />
only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely
<br />
known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale.
<br />
Canonical units: 1e-3; practical salinity units, which is dimensionless.
<br />
The use of parts per thousand (ppt) was expressed for
<br />
sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.
<br />
<br />sea_water_practical_salinity
<br />
Definition: Practical Salinity, S_P, is defined on the Practical Salinity
<br />
Scale of 1978 (PSS-78) and is calculated from the electrical conductivity
<br />
of sea water (as well as temperature and pressure). This name should be
<br />
used to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards; practical
<br />
salinity is the salinity quantity stored by national data centres for
<br />
post-1978 observations. The only exception to this is where the observed
<br />
salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical
<br />
Salinity Scale. More recently remote salinity measurements from satellites
<br />
(SMOS/AQUARIUS) also provide surface estimates of salinity presented in
<br />
S_P, however these are not obtained from conductivity measurements. In
<br />
these cases information about calibration and validation techniques to
<br />
convert remotely sensed salinity to S_P should be documented ? within the
<br />
variable &quot;comment&quot; attribute. There are also standard names for the
<br />
precisely defined salinity quantities sea_water_absolute_salinity and
<br />
sea_water_preformed_salinity. Salinity quantities that do not match any of
<br />
the precise definitions should be given the more general standard name of
<br />
sea_water_salinity.
<br />
Canonical units: Officially S_P is unitless, so that, while convenient,
<br />
and while it is common practice, it is not officially sanctioned to say
<br />
S_P = 35 psu. Often authors use PSS-78, as in S_P = 35 PSS-78. If salinity
<br />
was measured using remote satellite techniques, then it is recommended
<br />
that additional metadata (calibration/validation information) be described
<br />
in the variable comment attribute.

<br />
<br />sea_water_cox_salinity
<br />
Definition: Cox Salinity, S_C, is defined unitless as a fraction per mil
<br />
(0/00). S_C was the standard salinity measure until S_P (Practical
<br />
Salinity) was established with PSS-78 (1978). Chlorinity Cl is calculated
<br />
from the conductivity of a seawater sample, and since the work of the
<br />
Joint Panel for Oceanographic Tables (1966) is converted into Cox Salinity
<br />
using S_C = 1.80655 Cl. This type of salinity was called simply ?salinity?
<br />
from 1967 to 1978 and had the ?units? of 0/00, or ?parts per thousand? or
<br />
ppt. Practical Salinity replaced Cox Salinity in 1978.
<br />
Canonical units: (0/00) or ?parts per thousand?.

<br />
<br />sea_water_knudsen_salinity
<br />
Definition: Knudsen Salinity, S_K, is defined unitless as a fraction per
<br />
mil (0/00) and was calculated from the titration of inorganic salts from a
<br />
sample of sea water after a commission to study the problem of determining
<br />
salinity and density was initiated by the International Council for the
<br />
Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 1899. S_K was the standard salinity
<br />
measure until S_C (Cox Salinity) was established in 1967. Chlorinity Cl is
<br />
calculated by titration from a sample of seawater, and since the work of
<br />
Knudsen (1901) is converted into Knudsen Salinity using S_K = 0.030 +
<br />
1.805 Cl. This type of salinity was called simply ?salinity? from 1901 to
<br />
1966 and had the ?units? of 0/00, or ?parts per thousand? or ppt. From
<br />
1950 onwards electrical conductivity was used to estimate the Knudsen
<br />
Salinity rather than chemical titration, which was the standard before
<br />
this time. Cox Salinity replaced Knudsen Salinity in 1967.
<br />
Canonical units: (0/00) or ?parts per thousand?.

<br />
<br />sea_water_reference_salinity
<br />
Definition: If a seawater sample has the Reference Composition (dissolved
<br />
solutes, additional to Cl), then its Reference Salinity is the best
<br />
available estimate of its Absolute Salinity. For general purposes,
<br />
Reference Salinity is (35.16504 g kg-1)/35 times Practical Salinity.
<br />
Canonical units: g kg-1

<br />
<br />sea_water_absolute_salinity
<br />
Definition: Absolute salinity, S_A, is defined as a term in the
<br />
Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in
<br />
2010 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). It is the
<br />
mass fraction of dissolved material in sea water and TEOS-10 prescribes
<br />
units of g kg-1. Absolute Salinity incorporates the spatial variations in
<br />
the composition of seawater. This type of absolute salinity is also called
<br />
&quot;Density Salinity&quot;. TEOS-10 estimates Absolute Salinity as the salinity
<br />
variable that, when used with the TEOS-10 expression for density, yields
<br />
the correct density of a seawater sample even when the sample is not of
<br />
Reference Composition. In practice, Absolute Salinity is often calculated
<br />
from Practical Salinity using a pre-defined value for the Absolute
<br />
Salinity Anomaly, which is provided in the form of a global climatology.
<br />
It is recommended that the version of (TEOS-10) software and the
<br />
associated Absolute Salinity Anomaly climatology be specified within
<br />
metadata ? within the variable &quot;comment&quot; attribute. Standard names exist
<br />
for the related quantity, S_*, Preformed Salinity. Salinity observations
<br />
made using measurements of the conductivity of sea water after 1978 should
<br />
be given the standard name of sea_water_practical_salinity.

<br />
10.1016/j.dsr.2007.10.001
<br />
<br />sea_water_preformed_salinity
<br />
Definition: Preformed Salinity, S*, is defined as a term in the
<br />
Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in
<br />
2010 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Preformed
<br />
Salinity is a salinity variable that is designed to be as conservative as
<br />
possible, by removing the estimated biogeochemical influences on the sea
<br />
water composition. Preformed Salinity is Absolute Salinity, S_A (which has
<br />
the standard name sea_water_absolute_salinity), minus all contributions to
<br />
sea water composition from biogeochemical processes. Preformed Salinity
<br />
incorporates the spatial variations in the composition of sea water
<br />
because of its relationship to Absolute Salinity. It is a mass fraction of
<br />
dissolved material in sea water and TEOS-10 prescribes units of g kg-1.
<br />
Salinity observations made using measurements of the conductivity of sea
<br />
water after 1978 should be given the standard name of
<br />
sea_water_practical_salinity.
<br />
Canonical units: g kg-1

<br />
<br />sea_water_conservative_temperature
<br />
Definition: Conservative Temperature is defined as a term in the
<br />
Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in
<br />
2010 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Conservative
<br />
Temperature is specific potential enthalpy (which has the standard name
<br />
specific_potential_enthalpy_of_sea_water) divided by a fixed value of the
<br />
specific heat capacity of sea water, namely cp_0 = 3991.86795711963 J kg-1
<br />
K-1. Conservative Temperature is a more accurate measure of the &quot;heat
<br />
content&quot; of sea water, by a factor of one hundred, than is potential
<br />
temperature. Because of this, it can be regarded as being proportional to
<br />
the heat content of sea water per unit mass. Enthalpy can be written
<br />
either as (1) CpT, where Cp is heat capacity at constant pressure, T is
<br />
absolute temperature, or (2) U+pV, where U is internal energy, p is
<br />
pressure and V is volume.
<br />
Canonical units: K (or usually, degrees Celsius)
<br />

<br />
<br />sea_water_specific_potential_enthalpy
<br />
Definition: The potential enthalpy of a sea water parcel is the enthalpy
<br />
after an adiabatic and isohaline change in pressure from its in situ
<br />
pressure to the sea water pressure p = 0 dbar. &quot;specific&quot; means per unit
<br />
mass. Enthalpy can be written either as (1) CpT, where Cp is heat capacity
<br />
at constant pressure, T is absolute temperature, or (2) U+pV, where U is
<br />
internal energy, p is pressure and V is volume.
<br />
Canonical units: J kg-1
<br />

<br />
10.1175/1520-0485(2003)033&lt;0945:PEACOV&gt;2.0.CO;2
<br />
<br /><br />change_over_time_in_X: append text &quot;change_over_time_in_X&quot; means change in
<br />
a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds
<br />
of the time coordinate.
<br />
Canonical units: unit of X + s-1
<br />
<br /><br />So for clarity, the new proposed names are:
<br />
sea_water_practical_salinity
<br />
sea_water_cox_salinity
<br />
sea_water_knudsen_salinity
<br />
sea_water_reference_salinity
<br />
sea_water_absolute_salinity
<br />
sea_water_preformed_salinity
<br />
sea_water_conservative_temperature
<br />
sea_water_potential_enthalpy
<br />
change_over_time_in_sea_water_practical_salinity
<br />
change_over_time_in_sea_water_absolute_salinity
<br />
change_over_time_in_sea_water_preformed_salinity
<br />
change_over_time_in_sea_water_conservative_temperature

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Alison
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is great. Thanks for going through it so thoroughly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (b) sea_water_temperature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There is agreement to retain the standard name sea_water_temperature as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;this is useful particularly for observations. It currently has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;explanatory text. In response to the discussion I propose to add the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;following sentence: 'Sea temperature is the in situ (bulk) temperature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of the sea water, not the surface or skin temperature.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is important for models too; although the prognostic is often potential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;temperature, in-situ temperature is considered sometimes. Since this is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very general term, maybe we can leave it vague (and thus sidestep the need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to define surfaces). It is the in-situ temperature of sea water. SST is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;species of sea_water_temperature. It is analogous to air_temperature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (d) Do we need to modify the explanations of all the existing salinity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;quantities?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As I mentioned, there are twelve salinity names already in the standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;name table.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think these terms can remain vague too. In their vagueness, they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parallel to sea_water_salinity, which we are retaining, though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deprecating for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;future obs quantities, and models where applicable. If salinity is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these generic quantities can also be used for specific purposes. When it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;becomes necessary to be specific about *which* salinity is meant by e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  product_of_northward_sea_water_velocity_and_salinity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then a new specific standard name can be defined. We could modify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definitions to say that they can be used with any definition of salinity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(but specific ones could be proposed if required to make distinctions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (b) sea_water_knudsen_salinity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, I believe this should be in units of 1e-3.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (c) sea_water_reference_salinity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There has been a suggestion that this quantity should also be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;introduced as a standard name. No comments have so far been received on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;this proposal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Please could you remind us of the context?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
