<br />Sorry that the discussion about this has been so disjointed, but I think 
<br />
our needs can not be met with somethign as simple a a new feature type.
<br />
<br />We've had a bit of discussion about this, both on and off this list, but 
<br />
I don't think anyone has kept good notes of the main points raised. I'll 
<br />
try to write up a proposal soon, but briefly:
<br />
<br />The goal is to store the output of &quot;partical tracking&quot;models. These are 
<br />
used to mode the advection and dispersion of various substances in a 
<br />
flow field: oil spills, larval transport, pollutants in the atmosphere, etc.
<br />
<br />Some key features:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;* In general, what is of interest is a collection (100s to 10,000s, or 
<br />
more... ) of particles, rather than an one individual particle. Thus, it 
<br />
is more likely that the user might ask:
<br />
<br />&quot;where are all the particles at time T?&quot;
<br />
<br />than:
<br />
<br />&quot;How did particle X travel over time?&quot;
<br />
<br />This has consequences on how one stores the data, so that either 
<br />
question can be asked but the first is the more efficient one.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;* particles can have many associated attributes (properties, etc) that 
<br />
change over time.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;* Some models create a set of particles at one time, the track them 
<br />
for the duration of the run -- that is the easy case. But many models 
<br />
create and destroy particles as the model runs -- adding particles when 
<br />
increased resolution is desired, removing them as they move out of the 
<br />
domain, or are destroyed by physical processes.
<br />
<br />This is a key issue -- it is not so straightforward how to store them 
<br />
when they numbers change, and when you don't knoe at the start of teh 
<br />
model run how many particles there will be at any given time, or even 
<br />
the maximum number of particles.
<br />
<br />With discussion, we had come to something of a consensus that in order 
<br />
to accommodate these needs, a &quot;ragged array&quot; approach would work. i.e. a 
<br />
2-d table of sorts, with one row for each time step, and where each row 
<br />
might be any length. There appears to be something of a standard for 
<br />
this in CF already, and we have attempted to use that (more later).
<br />
<br />We've got a version of this working now in out software, but...
<br />
<br />The trick that Ute has brought up is that you may now neither how many 
<br />
particles there will be, nor how many time steps. Thus you would like to 
<br />
have two &quot;unlimited&quot; dimensions, which netcdf3 does not support. We've 
<br />
accomplished it because we know how many time steps will be run before 
<br />
we start.
<br />
<br />My first thought is that we could use exactly the same format as hs been 
<br />
discusses already, but make it optional to use netcdf4, an an unlimited 
<br />
time dimension. Presumably these files could be easily converted, after 
<br />
the fact, to a netcdf3 format, as the number of time steps would then be 
<br />
known.
<br />
<br />About netcdf 3 vs. 4 -- it seems netcdf4 has some nice features, after 
<br />
all, it was developed for a reason. However it doesn't not appear to 
<br />
have been widely adopted yet. However, maybe we really shouldn't bend 
<br />
over backwards to fit a data model to netcdf3 anymore -- it's a chick 
<br />
and egg problem, maybe time to make some eggs.
<br />
<br />For our part, we use the netcdf4 lib with Python anyway, though our 
<br />
C/C++ code is all using netcdf3 -- the burden of compiling the hdf libs 
<br />
is something we choose to avoid, though it's not that big a deal.
<br />
<br />Anyway -- more soon, I hope.
<br />
<br />-Chris
