Dear all,
<br />
<br />since the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme is moving towards using CF standard names as standard vocabulary, I'd like to propose a few standard names that represent aerosol properties being observed at the GAW surface sites. Since there seem to be various opinions about the procedure, I opened a corresponding ticket on the cf metadata track system and will now also post my proposal on this mailing list. Here's the list of variables and definitions:
<br />
<br /><br />1) volume_scattering_coefficient_in_air_due_to_dry_aerosol
<br />
<br />The volume scattering coefficient is the fractional change of radiative flux per unit path length due to redirection of an incident light beam by a component in the reference volume. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). &quot;Dry aerosol&quot; is aerosol at a relative humidity &lt; 40% where it hasn't taken up ambient water by hygroscopic growth. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. 
<br />
<br /><br />2) volume_absorption_coefficient_in_air_due_to_dry_aerosol
<br />
<br />The volume absorption coefficient is the fractional change of radiative flux per unit path length due to absorption of an incident light beam by a component in the reference volume. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). &quot;Dry aerosol&quot; is aerosol at a relative humidity &lt; 40% where it hasn't taken up ambient water by hygroscopic growth. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.
<br />
<br /><br />3) volume_hemispheric_backscattering_coefficient_in_air_due_to_dry_aerosol
<br />
<br />The volume hemispheric backscattering coefficient is the fractional change of radiative flux per unit path length due to redirection of an incident light beam into the rearward hemisphere relative to the incident beam by a component in the reference volume. It is distinct from the backscattering coefficient which isn't integrated over the rearward hemisphere. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). &quot;Dry aerosol&quot; is aerosol at a relative humidity &lt; 40% where it hasn't taken up ambient water by hygroscopic growth. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. 
<br />
<br /><br />4) surface_volume_scattering_coefficient_at_stp_in_air_due_to_pm1_dry_aerosol
<br />
<br />The volume scattering coefficient is the fractional change of radiative flux per unit path length due to redirection of an incident light beam by a component in the reference volume. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). &quot;Dry aerosol&quot; is aerosol at a relative humidity &lt; 40% where it hasn't taken up ambient water by hygroscopic growth. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;at_stp&quot; refers to a volume at standard conditions of temperature (273.15 K) and pressure (1013.25 hPa). &quot;pm1&quot; refers to the fraction of aerosol particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 1 micrometer.
<br />
<br /><br />5) surface_volume_scattering_coefficient_at_stp_in_air_due_to_pm10_dry_aerosol
<br />
<br />The volume scattering coefficient is the fractional change of radiative flux per unit path length due to redirection of an incident light beam by a component in the reference volume. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). &quot;Dry aerosol&quot; is aerosol at a relative humidity &lt; 40% where it hasn't taken up ambient water by hygroscopic growth. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;at_stp&quot; refers to a volume at standard conditions of temperature (273.15 K) and pressure (1013.25 hPa). &quot;pm10&quot; refers to the fraction of aerosol particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometers.
