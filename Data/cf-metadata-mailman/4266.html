Dear Ros
<br />
<br />Thanks a lot for working on this. I think you have correctly identified parts
<br />
which are stated as requirements and recommendations, but you have to put
<br />
yourself in the shoes of the CF-checker, and consider what you can actually
<br />
*do* to make the checks. The CF-checker, for instance, does not know what we
<br />
mean by element and instance dimensions, in the first statement:
<br />
<br />&quot;In the multidimensional array representations, data variables have both an
<br />
instance dimension and an element dimension.  The dimensions may be given in
<br />
any order.  If there is a need for either the instance or an element dimension
<br />
to be the netCDF unlimited dimension (so that more features or more elements
<br />
can be appended), then that dimension must be the outer dimension of the data
<br />
variable i.e. the leading dimension in CDL.&quot;
<br />
<br />To check this statement, I think we have first to refer to the table in 9.1,
<br />
which implies a lot of checks on dimensions and coordinates. For instance, if
<br />
the featureType att says it's a timeseries, the table says that the data is
<br />
logically 1D (i), and there are mandatory coord or aux coord vars with the
<br />
logical structure x(i) y(i) t(i,o). There are five possibilities for storing a
<br />
collection of timeseries features. These are alternative sets of requirements
<br />
for the CF-checker, and one of these sets must be satisfied:
<br />
<br />* Single timeseries: The data variable is 1D (the element dimension). It has a
<br />
coord var or a 1D aux coord var of time. It has two scalar coord vars of
<br />
horizontal position.
<br />
<br />* Orthogonal multidimensional representation: The data variable is 2D. One of
<br />
its dimensions (the element dimension) has a coordinate variable or a 1D
<br />
auxiliary coordinate variable of time. The other one (the instance dimension)
<br />
has two coordinate or 1D aux coord variables of horizontal position.
<br />
<br />* Incomplete multidimensional rep: The data variable is 2D. It has a 2D aux
<br />
coord var of time with the same dimensions as itself. One of the dimensions
<br />
has two coordinate or 1D aux coord variables of horizontal position.
<br />
<br />* Contiguous ragged array rep: The data variable is 1D. It has a 1D aux coord
<br />
var of time with this dimension. There is a variable in the file (the count
<br />
variable) with a sample_dimension att that names the dimension of the data
<br />
variable. The data variable has two 1D aux coord vars of horizontal position,
<br />
whose dimension is the dimension of the count variable.
<br />
<br />* Indexed ragged array rep: The data variable is 1D. It has a 1D aux coord var
<br />
of time with this dimension. There is an variable in the file (the index
<br />
variable) with the same dimension as the data variable and which has an
<br />
index_dimension att.  The data variable has two 1D aux coord vars of
<br />
horizontal position with the dimension is named by the instance_dimension att
<br />
of the index variable.
<br />
<br />This is a bottom-up approach, but that's what the checker has to do, isn't it.
<br />
When you find that one of these cases matches what you have, it allows you
<br />
formally to identify the instance and element dimensions, and the count and
<br />
index variables if relevant. Do you see what I mean? It would be necessary to
<br />
work through the other cases in a similar way, but it would take a lot of
<br />
space to write them all down in the conformance rules in the way I have done
<br />
above. Perhaps there would be a way to summarise the principles on which the
<br />
checker would work from the table.
<br />
<br />We did not say exactly what constitutes a horizontal coordinate. I propose
<br />
that if two horizontal coord or aux coord vars are required, they should be
<br />
longitude and latitude, or grid_longitude and grid_latitude, or
<br />
projection_x_coordinate and projection_y_coordinate, or *any* pair of
<br />
coordinates if one of them has axis='X' and the other axis='Y'. It is allowed
<br />
to provide more than one of these pairs, but it is not allowed (for instance)
<br />
to supply only longitude and grid_latitude, which don't form a pair.
<br />
<br />(It is always OK to supply coordinates in addition to those which are
<br />
mandatory. These can just be ignored by the checker.)
<br />
<br />Once these identifications have been made, other checks can be applied:
<br />
<br />H.2 It is recommended that there is be a variable with cf_role of
<br />
timeseries_id. If there is such a variable, it must have the instance
<br />
dimension. All the values of this variable must be different.  (These are for
<br />
timeseries. Corresponding but different rules would apply for profiles and
<br />
trajectories. Appendix H suggests others, such as it is recommended that there
<br />
should be station variables with standard_name attributes &quot;platform_name&quot;,
<br />
&quot;surface_altitude&quot; and &quot;platform_id&quot; when applicable, from H.5.)
<br />
<br />9.3 A count variable or an index variable must be integer.
<br />
<br />9.3 Negative values (except missing data) are not allowed in a count
<br />
variable. The sum of the non-missing values must not exceed the dimension of
<br />
the data variable.
<br />
<br />9.3 Negative values (except missing data) are not allowed in an index
<br />
variable. None of the values may be greater than or equal to the dimension of
<br />
the data variable (because they must be valid indices). All of the non-missing
<br />
values must be different.
<br />
<br />You say that the featureType att is required. This is a tricky one. We don't
<br />
know it's required unless we know we have a discrete sampling geometry that
<br />
requires it, but we don't know it's a discrete sampling geometry for sure
<br />
unless there is a featureType. I suggest you look for the featureType first,
<br />
and only apply the checks for sect 9 if it is present, except that you could
<br />
give an error if there is no featureType and there is a count or index var in
<br />
the file. That must indicate a ragged rep, and they require featureType.
<br />
<br />9.6 Where any auxiliary coordinate variable contains a missing value, all
<br />
other coordinate, auxiliary coordinate and data values corresponding to that
<br />
element should also contain missing values.
<br />
<br />9.6 Where the instance variable identified by cf_role contains a missing value
<br />
indicator, all other instance variable should also contain missing values
<br />
corresponding to that element.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
