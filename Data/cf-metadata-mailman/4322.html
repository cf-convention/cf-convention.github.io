Dear Nan
<br />
<br />I agree that the use of a string-valued aux coord var for &quot;source&quot; or
<br />
&quot;institution&quot; is not the only way to store this kind of information.  However,
<br />
I think there is some logic to this extension.  (Although conventions are
<br />
arbitrary, we prefer them to be logical!) I would make two arguments for it:
<br />
<br />* It is quite similar to the use of string-valued aux coord vars for &quot;region&quot;
<br />
and &quot;area_type&quot;, which are also allowed by CF; both of these are string-valued
<br />
and have standardised values. region is commonly used, for instance, when
<br />
storing the ocean meridional overturning streamfunction in a data variable
<br />
(basin,depth,latitude). The basin dimension is an index dimension which
<br />
doesn't have a (Unidata) numeric coordinate variable; instead it has a
<br />
string-valued aux coord var (following CF sect 6.1) providing labels such as
<br />
atlantic_ocean. area_type is used, for instance, to label a dimension that
<br />
runs over land surface types e.g. bare soil, grass, needleleaf trees. Both
<br />
of these kind of dimension are concerned with location in horizontal space,
<br />
so they are like geographical coordinates, although not numeric.
<br />
<br />* The commonest need for source and institution is to label a dimension that
<br />
runs over members of an ensemble. This is a frequent need in analysis of model
<br />
data, especially from intercomparisons. (If I remember correctly, I think that
<br />
the use of source and institution in this way came from this need for it.) The
<br />
ensemble dimension can be treated just like other dimensions, such as time,
<br />
lat and lon, when calculating statistics and other data reductions. Therefore
<br />
it seems natural for it to have coordinates. However, if they are string-
<br />
valued, they have to be aux coord vars. If the members of the ensemble just
<br />
had numbers, we could have a (Unidata) numeric coord var, and we could assign
<br />
a standard_name to it. This would then seem even more like a spatial coord
<br />
var, such as one with standard_name of model_level_number.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that these examples suggest a &quot;formal&quot; motivation for this use
<br />
of aux coord vars, namely that the metadata concerned in these cases (source,
<br />
institution, area_type, region, ensemble member number) is multi-valued, and
<br />
its dimension is one of the dimensions of the data variable. It's therefore
<br />
natural to see it like a 1D coordinate variable. When these strings are all
<br />
different, and if netCDF classic had a string data type, you could actually
<br />
store them in a 1D string-valued coord var.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do all the possible instance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables  (station, profile...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to have standard names, too?
</em><br />
<br />In chapter 9, we decided to use cf_role to indicate an instance variable that
<br />
labels the timeseries, profile, etc. I think this is mainly because we do not
<br />
mandate what *kind* of label this is. It might be a name, but it might numeric.
<br />
For instance, if we had decided to define a standard_name of
<br />
wmo_station_number, that number could provide the station identification, and
<br />
the instance variable would have both a cf_role and a standard_name. The
<br />
cf_role indicates generically the structural function of the variable, and the
<br />
standard_name indicates specifically what the values of it mean.
<br />
<br />I think the main inconsistency of using standard_names for things like this is
<br />
that they are not really geophysical variables, which is what we mostly define
<br />
standard names for. We have to beware of this.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I understand what you're conveying with this CDL, 'institution'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it looks really similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the NODC 'instrument' attribute.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that a variable attribute is a logical way to record a label which
<br />
applies to the whole data variable. It is hard to draw a distinction between
<br />
a string-valued attribute and a scalar string-valued aux coord var. If we
<br />
allow source as a standard_name, the same information could be stored like
<br />
this:
<br />
<br />variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float temperature(lat,lon);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature:source=&quot;Hadley Centre&quot;;
<br />
<br />or like this:
<br />
<br />variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float temperature(lat,lon);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature:coordinates=&quot;label&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;char label(stringlength);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label:standard_name=&quot;source&quot;;
<br />
data:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;source=&quot;Hadley Centre&quot;;
<br />
<br />and the first is probably better. However, the second is just a special case
<br />
of a *multi-valued* source.
<br />
<br />How can we decide between using a variable or using an attribute? I think that
<br />
we use variables when they might depend on data dimensions, or when they
<br />
themselves need attributes. The former is the reason in this case. Both are
<br />
general reasons why CF uses scalar or size-1 coord vars. For example, it's
<br />
better to store &quot;height of 1.5 m&quot; in a scalar coordinate variable than to
<br />
define a special attribute for &quot;height&quot;, because it needs a unit (m) and a
<br />
standard_name (height) to describe it, and these are just the same as you
<br />
would use for a multi-valued height coord var.
<br />
<br />The case where I think an ancillary_variable is most appropriate is when the
<br />
quantity being provided is metadata for *individual elements* of the data
<br />
variable. This mechanism was introduced to store things like standard errors,
<br />
but in another thread (Martin Boettcher's), there is discussion of providing
<br />
a string-valued aux coord var to specify the source for each *element* of the
<br />
data variable.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
