All,
<br />
<br />Sorry to wade into this discussion late, but I believe part of the
<br />
difficulty experienced in the discussions here are a consequence of
<br />
mixing two distinct 'concepts':
<br />
<br />1. Cloud Height Classification Based on Cloud Types
<br />
<br />There is a well-recognised allocations of cloud types to height-bands.
<br />
These types and bands are nicely illustrated both in tabular form and
<br />
visually on the Cloud Appreciation Society website at:
<br />
<a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/collecting/about-cloud-classificatio">http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/collecting/about-cloud-classificatio</a>
<br />
ns/
<br />
<a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/collecting/">http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/collecting/</a>
<br />
<br />I believe that this allocation to height bands is sufficiently
<br />
well-known to be characterized without attributing an owner (e.g. WMO)
<br />
or an observation process (e.g. SYNOP), as Heiko argued. Thus, (if
<br />
required) these should probably be given the standard names:
<br />
<br />low_type_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
medium_type_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
high_type_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
<br />*However*, at present I would argue that these can only be accurately
<br />
determined by a human inspection of the sky, which leads us to the
<br />
second concept...
<br />
<br />2. Cloud Height Classification Based on Height Ranges
<br />
<br />Most automated systems, be they cloud base recorders, numerical models
<br />
or other forecasting processes, will assign a cloud height class based
<br />
on a height range. In this case, I would argue that the following set of
<br />
standard names are more appropriate:
<br />
<br />low_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
medium_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
high_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
<br />I acknowledge that different height ranges will be adopted by different
<br />
users, but, as Heiko states, this approach will at least allow
<br />
Intercomparison, and the exact details of the height ranges used could
<br />
be included as additional (non-CF Standard) metadata.
<br />
<br /><br />Having presented these two 'concepts', I would suggest that the second
<br />
is likely to be the most useful, in an age where the human observers are
<br />
significantly outnumbered by automated observing and forecasting
<br />
systems. However, there is no reason why both sets of standard names
<br />
could not to adopted.
<br />
<br />My contribution to the debate - I hope it's helpful.
<br />
<br />Regards, 
<br />
Bruce

Subject: Re: [CF-metadata] Standard_name for cloud-cover by phenomenon
Philip,
I agree that referring to versioned std_name tables is generally a good
idea. The WMO members have (and still have) problems with versioning, in
particularly when I think about grib-tables.
I still have a bad feeling about using a name like
wmosynop_high_cloud_area_fraction or isccp_high_cloud_area_fraction in
particularly since they give a over-specification of a generally well
understood phenomenons. Both wmosynop and isccp are
measurements/measurement networks, and CF generally does not have enough
metadata to cover all measurement-details. E.g. for air-temperature, it
is from a measurement point of view often important what type of
instrument has been measuring it (automatic, human, scale,...). We don't
have a 'human_quicksilver_air_temperature' in CF (or a
wmosynop_air_temperature). For comparing 'air_temperature' between
measurements and possibly different models, the generally understood
'air_temperature' is best.
With high-clouds, this is a similar problem. high, medium and low clouds
is generally well understood and well documented in literature (a simple
search on the net gives more than enough hits).
 From a model point of view, I cannot estimate if a cloud is exactly the
one type or the other. There are often estimations like:
sigma &lt; 0.4 -&gt; high cloud
0.4 &gt; sigma &gt; 0.7 -&gt; medium cloud
sigma &gt; 0.7 -&gt; low cloud
It will be difficult for the modeller to say: This is a cloud according
to the wmosynop definition.
Therefore, I think we need at first a general CF-name for
high/medium/low cloud to be able to compare in between measurement
networks and models. ISCCP, WMO synop and models have already the
concept of these clouds, they are not a 100% match, but close enough.
If then one of these networks needs a more exact definition of
high/medium/low clouds, they should ask for a std_name of their own.
Best regards,
Heiko
