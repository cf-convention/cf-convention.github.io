Hi All,
<br />
<br />I just refreshed my memory of ISCCP, and I should not have been using it as an example in the way that I did (my apologies).
<br />
<br />Are there any other visual classification schemes in common use other than the current SYNOP one?
<br />
<br />Is the current SYNOP scheme likely to change significantly?
<br />
<br />This isn't my field, so I don't know the answers. If the answer to both questions is 'no', then I will drop all my objections.
<br />
<br />If the answer to either question is 'yes', then I would suggest that either the description be general enough to cover the different schemes, or we return to the idea of putting the name of the scheme into the std_name.
<br />
<br />Best wishes to all,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip

<br />Hi Philip,
<br />
<br />Very precicely speaking, what we propose is simulation of high/medium/low cloud area fractions following SYNOP rules.   Some operational NWP models do a kind of simulation of cloud that would be observed by humans at surface.  This is a kind of substitute of manned surface observation, so I believe it will be useful more and more.
<br />
<br />Regarding generality.  Some people may consider it roughly compatible with height-based definitions like ISCCP.  It's up to users.  But we have to make definition clear, mainly to avoid comments requesting use of vertical coordinate variable.  Cloud type-based classifications doesn't have natural vertical coordinate, and new names are only necessary for such parameters.  Height-based classifications can be described with existing standard name &quot;cloud_area_fraction&lt;<a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/standard-name-table/19/cf-standard-name-table.html">http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/standard-name-table/19/cf-standard-name-table.html</a>&gt;&quot; with vertical coordinate variable.
<br />
<br />Synoptic observation (coordinated by WMO) is probably only well-known type-based classification.  And it has been unchanged at least since 1975, and I personally think it isn't likely to change for many years.
<br />
<br />Above is my understanding but I believe and hope original proposal from Heiko is not too far from that.
<br />
<br />So now I see no problem to register high/middle/low_type_cloud_area_fraction .
<br />
<br /><br />Best Regards,
<br />
Eizi

<br />
<br />Thanks, Bruce.  Those emails helped crystalize it for me.
<br />
<br /><br />Heiko, Eizi, are you proposing that the definition of high/medium/low_type_cloud_area_fraction follow the SYNOP rules precisely?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Or will it be general enough to allow similar protocols, eg from ISCCP?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />If it is highly specific then I still feel it would be better to include the provenance (eg, WMOSYNOP).
<br />
<br />If the definition will be somewhat general then I will drop my objection. I am still not enthusiastic about using the work 'type' in this way, but I confess that I cannot think of a better alternative.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />

<br />
All,
<br />
<br />Also, sorry to step in late and not having read all the communications on this ...  but for your consideration:
<br />
<br />In Bruce's second case, wouldn't it be better to use a vertical coordinate (specifically the bounds on it) to indicate the cloud layer being considered?  The standard name &quot;cloud_area_fraction&quot; could then be used, and the coordinate would tell whether it was low, middle, or high (and would also quantitatively specify what is meant by those qualitative terms).
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
Karl

<br />All,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Sorry to wade into this discussion late, but I believe part of the
<br />
<br />difficulty experienced in the discussions here are a consequence of
<br />
<br />mixing two distinct 'concepts':
<br />
<br /><br /><br />1. Cloud Height Classification Based on Cloud Types
<br />
<br /><br /><br />There is a well-recognised allocations of cloud types to height-bands.
<br />
<br />These types and bands are nicely illustrated both in tabular form and
<br />
<br />visually on the Cloud Appreciation Society website at:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/collecting/about-cloud-classificatio">http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/collecting/about-cloud-classificatio</a>
<br />
<br />ns/
<br />
<br /><a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/collecting/">http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/collecting/</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I believe that this allocation to height bands is sufficiently
<br />
<br />well-known to be characterized without attributing an owner (e.g. WMO)
<br />
<br />or an observation process (e.g. SYNOP), as Heiko argued. Thus, (if
<br />
<br />required) these should probably be given the standard names:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />low_type_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
<br />medium_type_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
<br />high_type_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
<br /><br /><br />*However*, at present I would argue that these can only be accurately
<br />
<br />determined by a human inspection of the sky, which leads us to the
<br />
<br />second concept...
<br />
<br /><br /><br />2. Cloud Height Classification Based on Height Ranges
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Most automated systems, be they cloud base recorders, numerical models
<br />
<br />or other forecasting processes, will assign a cloud height class based
<br />
<br />on a height range. In this case, I would argue that the following set of
<br />
<br />standard names are more appropriate:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />low_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
<br />medium_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
<br />high_cloud_area_fraction
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I acknowledge that different height ranges will be adopted by different
<br />
<br />users, but, as Heiko states, this approach will at least allow
<br />
<br />Intercomparison, and the exact details of the height ranges used could
<br />
<br />be included as additional (non-CF Standard) metadata.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Having presented these two 'concepts', I would suggest that the second
<br />
<br />is likely to be the most useful, in an age where the human observers are
<br />
<br />significantly outnumbered by automated observing and forecasting
<br />
<br />systems. However, there is no reason why both sets of standard names
<br />
<br />could not to adopted.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />My contribution to the debate - I hope it's helpful.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruce
