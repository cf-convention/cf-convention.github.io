<br />
Dear all,
<br />
<br />a couple of weeks ago, I proposed a list of new CF variable names for surface aerosol optics properties (last version repeated at the end of this mail). We had a good discussion of the proposal, and due to lots of valuable comments, we managed to even out almost all issues, except for one, which left the proposal in an &quot;almost accepted&quot; state. I would therefore like to try to revive the discussion and bring it to a conclusion.
<br />
<br />The issue:
<br />
CF aerosol variable names so far use the terms &quot;_due_to_ambient_aerosol&quot; and &quot;due_to_dry_aerosol&quot;. For variables with &quot;_due_to_ambient_aerosol&quot;, a co-ordinate variable relative_humidity is required since most aerosol properties are strongly dependent on particle humidification, and not taking this effect into account would render any model-observation comparison meaningless. The observations of surface aerosol optical properties I'm concerned with are intended to be on the dry aerosol. In some locations however (e.g. in the tropics), sample drying can be incomplete at times, leaving the sample in a state between ambient and dry. For this reason, I proposed a subset of variables with &quot;_due_to_aerosol&quot;, also requiring a co-ordinate variable relative_humidity. In practice, these data would be used for comparisons in the same way as those with &quot;_due_to_ambient_aerosol&quot;, where the humidity state needs to be taken into account, except that the humidity is neither ambient nor dry.
<br />
<br />I know that it has been CF policy to define &quot;clean, textbook&quot; definitions of standard names, and this is certainly desirable from a model point of view. On the other hand, measurements oftentimes just aren't textbook clean. Also, we need to continue to bring models and observations closer together, and such a variable would be a good way of achieving this without too much compromise.
<br />
<br />I'm curious to hear opinions, and hopefully come to a conclusion on this issue.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
Markus

Updated list of proposed standard names (2012-03-21)
<br />
<br />1) volume_scattering_coefficient_in_air_due_to_dry_aerosol
<br />
<br />The volume scattering coefficient is the fractional change of radiative flux per unit path length due to redirection of an incident light beam by a component in the reference volume. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). Aerosol takes up ambient water (a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. &quot;Dry aerosol&quot; means aerosol fully dehydrated from its ambient state, which in practice often means brought to a relative humidity less than 40%. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency needs to be specified to indicate that the property applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies.

equal to 1 micrometer, where the size cut is applied under ambient conditions before the aerosol is dried. A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency needs to be specified to indicate that the property applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies.
