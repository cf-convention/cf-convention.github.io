Dear all,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Following John's comments, I am trying to propose more precise definitions before adding new sea level standard names. Your help and comments are welcome in this exercise, thanks!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />1)      tendency_of_global_average_sea_level_change (m/year)
<br />
<br />&quot;Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />? I suppose this one should be OK.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />2)      local_tendency_of_global_average_sea_level_change (m/year)
<br />
<br />&quot;Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Local &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. Local means computation at each grid point.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />? Regarding to previous standard name, I've got some troubles to easily explain the &quot;local&quot; dimension of the quantity. Basically, it doesn't mean that the computing process take into account local effects; this only means that we compute the sea level change for each NetCDF grid point to watch what is the value of sea level change in a given area. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />3)      global_average_sea_level_change_annual_amplitude (m)
<br />
<br />&quot;Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level.  Amplitude is the magnitude of a wave modeled by a sinusoidal function.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />? I just added a common definition for amplitude.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />4)      global_average_sea_level_change_annual_phase (degree)
<br />
<br />&quot;Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Phase is the initial angle of a wave modeled by a sinusoidal function.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />?I just added a common definition for phase.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />5)      global_average_sea_level_change_semiannual_amplitude (m)
<br />
<br />&quot;Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Amplitude is the magnitude of a wave modeled by a sinusoidal function.&quot;
<br />
<br />6)      global_average_sea_level_change_semiannual_phase (degree)
<br />
<br />&quot;Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Phase is the initial angle of a wave modeled by a sinusoidal function.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />?I made the supposition that the concept of &quot;annual&quot; or &quot;semi-annual&quot; are enough explicit, then I do not provide any definitions. But if it's not, feel free to comment it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />

Objet : [CF-metadata] Standard names for sea level change
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Dear CF people,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I'd like to complete CF standard names list about sea level change variables. I am especially interested in the following terms introduction:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />tendency_of_global_average_sea_level_change (m/year)
<br />
<br />Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time.
<br />
<br />tendency_of_local_average_sea_level_change (m/year)
<br />
<br />Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Local means the quantity is depicted locally. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time.
<br />
<br />global_average_sea_level_change_annual_amplitude (m)

<br />Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions.
