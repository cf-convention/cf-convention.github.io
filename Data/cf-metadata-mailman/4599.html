Dear Alison,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fine on both accounts. I suggest to use the comment attribute as you suggested and give the appropriate hint in the definition text. I also second the addition of Philip concerning the specification of the units. This later topic may come up again -- if I recall correctly there was an older discussion on such &quot;atom-based&quot; mass units, which are quite commonly used. For now, we should assume that mass is mass of compound, and when the need arises, we will have to introduces a couple of &quot;clones&quot; with the &quot;_expressed_as&quot; addition to the standard_names.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Martin

<br />Hi Jonathan, et al.,
<br />
<br />We do have a number of other cases where we effectively specify integrals/averages within std_names.  For example, we have atmosphere_moles_of_X as a global integral.  We also have atmosphere_mass_content_of_X as a column integral.
<br />
<br />I know there are advantages and disadvantages.  Personally, I believe the bar should be high to be included as a separate standard name, but there are cases such as these which pass over the bar.  I am personally happy to leave these global_average_sea_level names as they are.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regarding the existing standard_name global_average_sea_level_change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the corresponding ones for steric and thermosteric:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is anomalous to have &quot;global&quot; and &quot;average&quot; in a standard name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because, as Philip says, we usually put these kinds of thing in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell_methods. The reason for having them in the standard name in these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases is that these global quantities are commonly referred to without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being regarded as the global average of something. You can imagine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other quantities which refer to the whole world; for example we might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a standard name for the age of the Earth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although it's a fuzzy distinction, it's not quite like global average
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; air temperature change, for example. We do not have a standard name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for that, because people do regard it as the global average of local
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; air temperature change. That is how it is computed. Global average sea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level change, before satellite altimetry began, is estimated from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sparse measurements by various methods.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, we could change to using more systematic names, although it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a bit more obscure. global_average_sea_level_change could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described by a standard_name of change_in_ocean_thickness with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell_methods of &quot;area: mean over sea&quot; for the whole world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; global_average_thermosteric_sea_level_change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be change_in_ocean_thickness_due_to_thermosteric_change. Should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we make that change (with aliases)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />
<br />Hi Olivier, et al.,
<br />
<br />I note that we have several different types of sea_level defined in CF.  I have copied here the ones I found (there may be others). Does one of these meet your needs?
<br />
<br />global_average_sea_level_change
<br />
<br />Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level.
<br />
<br />global_average_steric_sea_level_change
<br />
<br />Global average steric sea level change is caused by changes in sea water density due to changes in temperature (thermosteric) and salinity (halosteric). Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level.
<br />
<br />global_average_thermosteric_sea_level_change
<br />
<br />Global average thermosteric sea level change is the part caused by change in density due to change in temperature i.e. thermal expansion. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level.
<br />
<br />ocean_rigid_lid_pressure_expressed_as_sea_surface_height_above_geoid
<br />
<br />&quot;Ocean rigid lid pressure&quot; means the pressure at the surface of an ocean model assuming that it is bounded above by a rigid lid.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_height_above_geoid
<br />
alias: sea_surface_elevation
<br />
alias: sea_surface_elevation_anomaly
<br />
The geoid is a surface of constant geopotential with which mean sea level would coincide if the ocean were at rest. (The volume enclosed between the geoid and the sea floor equals the mean volume of water in the ocean.) In an ocean GCM the geoid is the surface of zero depth, or the rigid lid if the model uses that approximation. &quot;Sea surface height&quot; is a time-varying quantity. By definition of the geoid, the global average of the time-mean sea surface height (i.e. mean sea level) above the geoid must be zero. The standard name for the height of the sea surface above mean sea level is sea_surface_height_above_sea_level. The standard name for the height of the sea surface above the reference ellipsoid is sea_surface_height_above_reference_ellipsoid.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_height_above_sea_level
<br />
alias: sea_surface_height
<br />
<br />sea_surface_height_above_reference_ellipsoid
<br />
&quot;Sea surface height&quot; is a time-varying quantity. A reference ellipsoid is a mathematical figure that approximates the geoid. The geoid is a surface of constant geopotential with which mean sea level would coincide if the ocean were at rest. The ellipsoid is an approximation because the geoid is an irregular shape. A number of reference ellipsoids are defined for use in the field of geodesy. The standard name for the height of the sea surface above the geoid is sea_surface_height_above_geoid. The standard name for the height of the sea surface above mean sea level is sea_surface_height_above_sea_level.
<br />

<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Olivier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I appreciate the idea suggested by Philip, which is remove 'local'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use &quot;tendency_of_average_sea_level_change&quot;. I think it's a fine solution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sorry to say I still have concerns with this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * Why is &quot;average&quot; needed? As Philip said, we usually convey that idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the cell_methods, which can distinguish if necessary between a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; local point measurement e.g. &quot;lat: lon: point&quot; and an area-average &quot;lat: lon: mean&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or &quot;area: mean&quot;. Or does &quot;average&quot; refer to the time-mean?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * &quot;Sea level change&quot; is not well-defined. Could you say more precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what this quantity is, if it is not change in ocean thickness (that was my guess)?

<br />Martin,
<br />
<br />I'll answer on the mailing-list since I have no trac-account.
<br />
<br />2) seems fine to me, since it's only an extension to netcdf4/CDM-2.
<br />
<br />1) I've never had problems with the current set of rules, so some more concrete examples where the current rules don't work might help persuade me.
<br />
<br />And even your proposal is not completely clear: Do you really want to have both 'standard_name' and 'axis', or would one be enough. Requiring both 'axis = &quot;X&quot;' and 'standard_name = &quot;projection_x_axis&quot;' does not look efficient.
<br />
<br /><br />Best regards,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Dear all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       in an offline discussion with Jonathan and a few others, it became
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   apparent that there may be a few limitations in the current CF convention
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   which make life difficult for building true interoperable services. One of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   the major obstacles at present is the optional character of attributes, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   particular for coordinate axes. If an application cannot rely on finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   some specific information about a coordinate, it becomes virtualyl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   impossible to interpret this information correctly without human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   intervention (or one has to start guessing which will almost certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   fail at some point). According to my understanding, making attributes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   mandatory could break the backward compatibility principle that CF has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   hitherto held very high. Therefore, it appears appropriate to begin a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   collection of issues about the current CF convention which impediment the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   implementation of interoperability, and which would not be backward-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   compatible. Depending on the outcome of this discussion (for which we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   should allow some time), one could decide to either start a new CF major
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   version number, or adopt all incompatible changes in one new step release
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   version. It should be avoided to introduce incompatible changes in several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   individual releases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        Here I begin with three items. Responses should indicate whether they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   agree that these changes cause incompatibilities. If you want to add other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   issues, please prepend an item number. If discussions on individual issues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   get lengthy, we should open separate track tickets for them and feed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   conclusion back into this ticket.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   1) make axis attribute and standard_name attribute mandatory for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   coordinate variables
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

Dear Martin and Jonathan,
Thank you both for your comments. Regarding the provision of additional metadata about the particular processes included within a variable I think we should not change the syntax of the standard name itself for two reasons: (1) We would have to propose a modification to the CF conventions under a trac ticket which would then have to be discussed and agreed - this would delay the introduction of the names into the table (the current conventions say &quot;A standard name contains no whitespace and is case sensitive&quot; with the only exception being for the use of a standard name modifier); (2) I think it would be very difficult to standardize what the additional text should be - this is why I suggested using a comment attribute that allows free text to be included. There is nothing to stop co-workers within a project agreeing a further standardisation of the contents of the comment attribute to further aid data exchange but that need not be part of the CF conventions themselves.
In the definitions of the group chemical names such as &quot;alkanes&quot; we suggest use of the comment attribute to list the species that are included in a particular model. That is why I suggested the same approach for the emissions names. The other alternative would be to include the information using the long_name attribute whose values are also not standardized. Would that be more appropriate? Whichever attribute we choose to use, I think the standard name definition should include some guidance to that effect so that we at least encourage some standardization of which attributes to inspect for the information.
If we can agree on this last point I will prepare definitions for the twelve emissions categories based on Martin's wording and suggesting either comment or long_name as the place to put the additional metadata.
Best wishes,
Alison

&gt;
&gt; Dear Alison
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your careful and thoughtful commentary on Martin's
&gt; proposal. I agree that we should accept them as they are. It may not
&gt; be the last word, but that is always the case with CF! If we decide
&gt; subsequently that we need a quite different approach, we will have to
&gt; introduce aliases to support these names which we are adding now.
&gt;
&gt; I think it is OK to recommend including further information where
&gt; helpful, but I would not say in the definition that it &quot;should&quot; be
&gt; included.
&gt; That
&gt; appears to mandate a standard use of a non-standardised attribute
&gt; (comment), without proposing how it should be done, as Martin says. I
&gt; would recommend saying something like, &quot;If clarification is useful or
&gt; necessary, it could be given in the comment attribute.&quot; In fact this
&gt; may not really be necessary to say, because it's always true that one
&gt; could use the comment attribute, or others such as long_name and
&gt; references, to record extra information.
&gt;
&gt; Best wishes

Dear Philip,
Thank you for your suggestion. I hope that Martin can confirm whether it would be useful to add the sentence about the mass to the definitions. Personally, I think that it would be a useful clarification.

&gt;
&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; There are endless ways to slice, dice, and combine emission categories.
&gt; In practice, Martin's proposal is about as good as it gets, and
&gt; although there is the theoretical possibility for massive numbers of
&gt; std_names, I think in practice it will be large but manageable.
&gt;
&gt; The most important thing with emissions is to know clearly what is and
&gt; isn't included, and these descriptions are better than others I have
&gt; had to work with.
&gt;
&gt; I therefore support these std_names, with one recommendation:
&gt;
&gt; One common source of confusion for emissions is what the mass refers
&gt; to.   It is common to find emissions quantified by the 'main' element
&gt; rather than the whole molecule (eg emissions of carbon rather than
&gt; carbon dioxide).   To avoid such confusion, I recommend we add a
&gt; sentence to each description saying 'The mass is the total mass of the
&gt; molecules'.
&gt;
&gt; Note that if people want to specify the emissions by an element mass
&gt; only, then we already have a natural way to extend these std_names
&gt; using '_expressed_as_'.
&gt;
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt;
&gt;      Philip

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dear Martin, All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Martin Schultz proposed a set of emission names about 12 months ago
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; there has been some sporadic discussion since. I would like to draw
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; discussion to a conclusion so that we are in a position to include
&gt; these
&gt; &gt; quantities, which are clearly of fundamental importance to the
&gt; climate
&gt; &gt; community, in the standard name table.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To summarize the situation so far: there has been discussion of the
&gt; syntax of
&gt; &gt; the names and I think that we quite quickly reached a consensus on
&gt; &gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_X_due_to_emission_from_Y
&gt; &gt; (kg m-2 s-1) where X is the chemical species and Y is the emission
&gt; sector. I
&gt; &gt; think also that there is no problem about the chemical species names
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; have been proposed. The remaining question is therefore one of
&gt; describing
&gt; &gt; and defining the emissions sectors and Martin has provided references
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; IPCC documentation describing &quot;source categories&quot;. Steven Smith and
&gt; &gt; Gregory Frost supported the proposals for the sectors; Heiko Klein
&gt; suggested
&gt; &gt; that they are too tied to IPCC and that a more general list of
&gt; sectors would be
&gt; &gt; desirable. Martin replied that there is scope for future activity in
&gt; developing
&gt; &gt; an emissions vocabulary, but it seems as though that work that is
&gt; still very
&gt; &gt; much in progress. Martin (off list) has also expressed the view that
&gt; there are
&gt; &gt; currently only two can  didates for describing emissions sectors:
&gt; IPCC and
&gt; &gt; something called 'SNAP'. Apparently the two definitions overlap, but
&gt; are not
&gt; &gt; identical. Martin's proposal follows the recommendations of GEIA (the
&gt; Global
&gt; &gt; emissions inventory activity). There have not been any other comments
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; this set of proposals since 10th March.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; First a reminder of the proposed emission categories (twelve in all),
&gt; followed
&gt; &gt; by my suggestion for how we should proceed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; aviation (1A3a).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Clearly each proposed name involves a grouping together of a 'basket'
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; processes and doubtless different combinations could be chosen than
&gt; those
&gt; &gt; arrived at by the IPCC. For example, one could imagine a dataset that
&gt; &gt; combined 'land_transport' and 'maritime_transport' into a
&gt; &gt; 'surface_transport' category. Equally, one could imagine a dataset
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; subdivided the emissions into more categories than the IPCC process,
&gt; e.g.,
&gt; &gt; 'extraction_and_distribution_of_natural_gas',
&gt; &gt; 'extraction_and_refinement_of_crude_oil', and so on. The current
&gt; proposals
&gt; &gt; would certainly not prevent us from introducing such names for
&gt; broader or
&gt; &gt; narrower categories if they were required in the future. Equally they
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; not prevent us from introducing names for categories that overlap two
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; more of the current proposals, e.g.,
&gt; &gt; 'commercial_and_industrial_combustion'. In all these cases we would
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; able to construct meaningful standard names that would allow data
&gt; users to
&gt; &gt; answer the question of whether two quanti  ties are comparable (the
&gt; central
&gt; &gt; purpose of standard names). Furthermore, it seems unlikely, based on
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; discussion so far in this thread, that we could design a set of
&gt; standard names
&gt; &gt; now that will definitively describe all possible categories and
&gt; combinations of
&gt; &gt; emissions that will be needed for datasets in the future. Therefore I
&gt; think
&gt; &gt; that we should accept Martin's proposals while recognizing that we
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; almost certainly need to introduce new standard names for emissions
&gt; as new
&gt; &gt; datasets become available.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wonder, however, whether we could generalize the definitions a
&gt; little so
&gt; &gt; that the proposed names could be used for variables containing both
&gt; IPCC-
&gt; &gt; like and other data that fall into broadly the same categories. I
&gt; think we could
&gt; &gt; achieve this by using the wording that Martin has provided and
&gt; &gt; recommending that additional metadata be provided as to exactly which
&gt; &gt; processes are included in a particular dataset (in the same way that
&gt; we ask
&gt; &gt; for extra detail when using group chemical names such as 'alkanes').
&gt; For
&gt; &gt; example, Martin proposes
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_X_due_to_emission_from_e
&gt; &gt; nergy_p
&gt; &gt; &gt; roduction_and_distribution
&gt; &gt; &gt; Definition: The 'energy production and distribution' sector refers
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source
&gt; categories
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1A1 and 1B as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national
&gt; &gt; &gt; greenhouse gas inventories. It comprises fuel combustion activities
&gt; &gt; &gt; related to energy industries (1A1) and fugitive emissions from
&gt; fuels
&gt; &gt; &gt; (1B). It may also include any not-classified or &quot;other&quot; combustion,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which is commonly included in energy-related inventory data.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Perhaps we could adjust this to: 'The &quot;energy production and
&gt; distribution&quot;
&gt; &gt; sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to energy
&gt; industries and
&gt; &gt; fugitive emissions from fuels. It may also include any not-classified
&gt; or &quot;other&quot;
&gt; &gt; combustion, which is commonly included in energy-related inventory
&gt; data.
&gt; &gt; &quot;Energy production and distribution&quot; is the term used in standard
&gt; names to
&gt; &gt; describe a collection of emission sources. Where possible, the data
&gt; variable
&gt; &gt; should be accompanied by a complete description of the individual
&gt; sources
&gt; &gt; that are included, for example, by using a comment attribute. The
&gt; comment
&gt; &gt; attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC
&gt; &gt; (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories
&gt; &gt; 1A1 and 1B as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national
&gt; greenhouse
&gt; &gt; gas inventories&quot;.'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Would this be an acceptable way forward? If anyone thinks we should
&gt; take a
&gt; &gt; much different approach to dealing with the emissions standard names,
&gt; &gt; please can I ask for specific suggestions rather than general
&gt; comments as we
&gt; &gt; do need to make progress on finalising these quantities.
