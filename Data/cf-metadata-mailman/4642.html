Dear Martin, Jonathan and Philip,
<br />
<br />I have prepared amended definitions for all the emissions sectors based on our recent discussion (please see below). In addition, for each chemical species there will be an explanatory sentence or two (see below also). I have only given the definitions for species which are new to the standard name table with this set of names. Other species already have established definitions. The definition of an individual name will combine the appropriate definitions for the sector, species, some standard text used for all names containing the terms 'tendency', 'content', 'emission' and 'due_to' and Philip's suggested explanation for 'mass'.  For example, the full definition for the first proposed name, tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_carbon_monoxide_due_to_emission_from_energy_production_and_distribution, would read:
<br />
<br />' &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula of carbon monoxide is CO. 'The &quot;energy production and distribution&quot; sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to energy industries and fugitiv<br />
e emissions from fuels. It may also include any not-classified or &quot;other&quot; combustion, which is commonly included in energy-related inventory data. &quot;Energy production and distribution&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. If clarification of the emission sources is useful or necessary, it could be given in the comment attribute. The comment attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 1A1 and 1B as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories&quot;. '
<br />
<br />I still have a few questions on the detail of some of the definitions which I have marked inline below with **. Martin, if you could answer these questions and let me know if you are otherwise happy with the definitions then I think the names can be accepted for publication in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />I had hoped to do an update of the standard name table by the end of July, but due to staff absences over the summer (my own and those of other staff members at CEDA and BODC) it is necessary to set a date of 30th August for the next update. It will consist of approaching 300 names, by far the largest yet attempted with the CEDA vocabulary editor. The individual emission names have now been loaded into the editor and I will add the definitions once we have agreed them here on the mailing list.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

Sector Definitions
energy_production_and_distribution:
'The &quot;energy production and distribution&quot; sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to energy industries and fugitive emissions from fuels. It may also include any not-classified or &quot;other&quot; combustion, which is commonly included in energy-related inventory data. &quot;Energy production and distribution&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. If clarification of the emission sources is useful or necessary, it could be given in the comment attribute. The comment attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 1A1 and 1B as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories&quot;. '
industrial_processes_and_combustion:
'The &quot;industrial processes and combustion&quot; sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to manufacturing industries and construction, industrial processes related to mineral products, the chemical industry, metal production, the production of pulp, paper, food and drink, and non-energy industry use of lubricants and waxes. It may also include any not-classified or &quot;other&quot; combustion, which is commonly included in industry-related inventory data. &quot;Industrial processes and combustion&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources.

'
**Does the suggested text for the comment attribute contain the correct list of categories? The original definition provided by Martin refers to &quot;1A2, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and 2E&quot; in the first sentence but later refers to &quot;non-energy use of lubricants/waxes (2G)&quot; which isn't in the first list. Is this just a typo?
residential_and_commercial_combustion:
'The &quot;residential and commercial combustion&quot; sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to the commercial/institutional sector, the residential sector and the agriculture/forestry/fishing sector. It may also include any not-classified or &quot;other&quot; combustion, which is commonly included in the inventory data. &quot;Residential and commercial combustion&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. If clarification of the emission sources is useful or necessary, it could be given in the comment attribute. The comment attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 1A4a, 1A4b and 1A4c as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories&quot;. '
solvent_production_and_use:
'The &quot;solvent production and use&quot; sector comprises industrial processes related to the consumption of halocarbons, SF6, solvent and other product use. &quot;Solvent production and use&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources.

The comment attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 2F and 3 as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories&quot;. '
agricultural_production:
The &quot;agricultural production&quot; sector comprises the agricultural processes of enteric fermentation, manure management, rice cultivation (4C), agricultural soils and other. It may also include any not-classified or &quot;other&quot; combustion, which is commonly included in agriculture-related inventory data. &quot;Agricultural production&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. If clarification of the emission sources is useful or necessary, it could be given in the comment attribute. The comment attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D and 4G as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national
greenhouse gas inventories&quot;. '
agricultural_waste_burning:
'The &quot;agricultural waste burning&quot; sector comprises field burning of agricultural residues. &quot;Agricultural waste burning&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. If clarification of the emission sources is useful or necessary, it could be given in the comment attribute. The comment attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source category 4F as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas
Inventories&quot;. '
waste_treatment_and_disposal:
'The &quot;waste treatment and disposal&quot; sector comprises solid waste disposal on land, wastewater handling, waste incineration and other waste disposal. &quot;Waste treatment and disposal&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources.

The comment attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 6A, 6B, 6C and 6D as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories&quot;. '
forest_fires:
'The &quot;forest fires&quot; sector comprises the burning (natural and human-induced) of living or dead vegetation in forests. &quot;Forest fires&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. If clarification of the emission sources is useful or necessary, it could be given in the comment attribute. The comment attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source category 5 as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas
Inventories&quot;. '
savanna_and_grassland_fires:
'The &quot;savanna and grassland fires&quot; sector comprises the burning (natural and human-induced) of living or dead vegetation in non-forested areas. It excludes field burning of agricultural residues. &quot;Savanna and grassland fires&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources.

The comment attribute could be a list of sources or a reference such as &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source category 5 as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas
Inventories&quot;. '
** The definitions of both &quot;forest_fires&quot; and &quot;savanna_and_grassland_fires&quot; refer to IPCC source category 5; is that correct?
** I assume that the phrase in parenthesis &quot;(natural and human induced)&quot; refers to the fires, not the land use type; is that correct? I have moved the phrase to make the meaning clearer.

Species Definitions (as provided by Martin)
alcohols:
'Alcohols include all organic compounds with an alcoholic (OH) group.'
** Do we need any additional qualifying text about &quot;alcohols&quot; being a group chemical name, e.g., 'In standard names &quot;alcohols&quot; is the term used to describe the group of chemical species that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.' ?
pentane:
'The chemical formula for pentane is C5H12. Pentane is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkanes. There are standard names for the alkane group as well as for some of the individual species.'
trimethylbenzene:
'The chemical formula for trimethylbenzene is C9H12. The IUPAC names for trimethylbenzene is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Trimethylbenzene is an aromatic hydrocarbon. There are standard names that refer to aromatic_compounds as a group, as well as those for individual species.'
esters:
'Esters in organic chemistry are chemical compounds derived by reacting an oxoacid with a hydroxyl compound such as an alcohol or phenol. Esters are usually derived from an inorganic acid or organic acid in which at least one -OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an -O-alkyl (alkoxy) group, and most commonly from carboxylic acids and alcohols. That is, esters are formed by condensing an acid with an alcohol. In standard names &quot;esters&quot; is the term used to describe the group of ester species that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.'
ethers:
'Ethers are a class of organic compounds that contain an ether group - an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups - of general formula R-O-R. In standard names &quot;ethers&quot; is the term used to describe the group of ether species that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.'
chlorinated_hydrocarbons:
'Chlorinated hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals composed of carbon, chlorine and hydrogen. As pesticides, they are also referred to by several other names, including chlorinated organics, chlorinated insecticides and chlorinated synthetics. In standard names &quot;chlorinated_hydrocarbons&quot; is the term used to describe the group of chlorinated hydrocarbon species that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.'
ketones:
'In organic chemistry, a ketone is a compound with the structure RC(=O)R', where R and R' can be a variety of atoms and groups of atoms. It features a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two other carbon atoms. Acetone is the simplest example of a ketone. In standard names &quot;ketones&quot; is the term used to describe the group of ketone species that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.'
organic_acids:
'An organic acid is an organic compound with acidic properties. The most common organic acids are the carboxylic acids, whose acidity is associated with their carboxyl group -COOH. In standard names &quot;organic_acids&quot; is the term used to describe the group of organic acid species that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.'
