<br />
Dear All,
<br />
<br />I wish to propose the standard names below for acceptance in the official
<br />
list. Those of you with good memory may remember my message from
<br />
October 2010 where I proposed several very similar names. There was
<br />
never a final
<br />
decision on that proposal so consider the names here as the improved
<br />
version of the old ones. Hopefully the second try will be more successful.
<br />
<br />The names are developed primarely to support satellite data and were
<br />
first posted on the CF-Satellite mailing list. I am very grateful to
<br />
that community for all the comments and suggestions. This proposal is
<br />
much better because of that.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard names are:
<br />
<br />1) sensor_band_identifier
<br />
<br />Alphanumeric identifier of a sensor band.
<br />
<br />Units: N/A
<br />
<br />2) sensor_band_central_wavelength
<br />
<br />The central wavelength of a sensor's band, calculated as the first
<br />
moment of the band's normalized spectral response function.
<br />
<br />Units: m
<br />
<br />3) sensor_band_central_wavenumber
<br />
<br />The central wavenumber of a sensor's band, calculated as the first
<br />
moment of the band's normalized spectral response function.
<br />
<br />Units: m-1
<br />
<br />4) sensor_band_central_frequency
<br />
<br />The central frequency of a sensor's band, calculated as the first
<br />
moment of the band's normalized spectral response function.
<br />
<br />Units: Hz
<br />
<br />5) time_interval
<br />
<br />An interval of time.
<br />
<br />Units: s
<br />
<br />6) datetime_iso8601
<br />
<br />String containing date-time information in one of the ISO 8601
<br />
formats. Variables with this standard name cannot serve as coordinate
<br />
variables.
<br />
<br />Units: N/A
<br />
<br />7) sensor_zenith_angle
<br />
<br />The angle between the line of sight to the sensor and the local
<br />
zenith; a value of zero is directly overhead.
<br />
<br />Units: degree
<br />
<br />8) platform_look_angle
<br />
<br />&quot;platform&quot; refers to the vehicle from which observations are made e.g.
<br />
airplane, ship, or satellite. Platform look angle is the angle between
<br />
the line of sight from the platform and the direction straight
<br />
vertically down. Zero look angle means looking directly beneath the
<br />
platform.
<br />
<br />Units: degree
<br />
<br />9) sensor_look_angle
<br />
<br />The angle between the line of sight from the sensor and the direction
<br />
straight vertically down. Zero look angle means looking directly
<br />
beneath the sensor.
<br />
<br />Units: degree
<br />
<br />10) platform_azimuth_angle
<br />
<br />&quot;platform&quot; refers to the vehicle from which observations are made e.g.
<br />
airplane, ship, or satellite. Platform azimuth angle is the horizontal
<br />
angle between the line of sight from the observation point to the
<br />
platform and a reference direction at the observation point, which is
<br />
often due north. The angle is measured clockwise starting from the
<br />
reference direction.
<br />
<br />Units: degree
<br />
<br />11) sensor_azimuth_angle
<br />
<br />The horizontal angle between the line of sight from the observation
<br />
point to the sensor and a reference direction at the observation
<br />
point, which is often due north. The angle is measured clockwise
<br />
starting from the reference direction.
<br />
<br />Units: degree
<br />
<br />12) relative_platform_azimuth_angle
<br />
<br />Difference between two platform_azimuth_angle values.
<br />

<br />
space; &quot;spectral&quot; means per unit wavenumber or as a function of
<br />
wavenumber. Radiance is the radiant power per unit area in a

<br />
sensor's adjacent field of views within a collocation target.
<br />
Collocation target is an area on the Earth's surface at which
<br />
observations from at least two sensors are collected. Its size is
<br />
defined by the sensor with the largest field of view footprint.
<br />
<br />Units: mW m-2 sr-1 (cm-1)-1
<br />
<br />16) toa_outgoing_spectral_radiance_stdev_within_collocation_target
<br />
<br />Standard deviation of toa_outgoing_spectral_radiance observations from
<br />
sensor's adjacent field of views within a collocation target.
<br />
Collocation target is an area on the Earth's surface at which
<br />
observations from at least two sensors are collected. Its size is
<br />
defined by the sensor with the largest field of view footprint.
<br />
<br />Units: mW m-2 sr-1 (cm-1)-1
<br />
<br />17) toa_outgoing_spectral_radiance_mean_within_collocation_scene

<br />
<br />22) covariance_between_constant_and_linear_terms_of_spectral_radiance_correction
<br />
<br />Covariance between
<br />
constant_term_of_spectral_radiance_correction_due_to_intercalibration
<br />
and linear_term_of_spectral_radiance_correction_due_to_intercalibration
<br />
values.
<br />
<br />Units: mW m-2 sr-1 (cm-1)-1
<br />
<br />23) toa_brightness_temperature_of_standard_scene
<br />
<br />&quot;toa&quot; means top of atmosphere. Brightness temperature of a body is the
<br />
temperature of a black body which radiates the same power per unit
<br />
solid angle per unit area at a given wavenumber. Standard scene is a
<br />
target area with typical Earth surface and atmospheric conditions that
<br />
is accepted as a reference. The top-of-atmosphere radiance of the
<br />
standard scene is calculated using a radiative transfer model for a
<br />
given viewing geometry. The resultant top-of-atmosphere spectral
<br />
radiance is then integrated with a sensor's spectral response function
<br />
and converted to equivalent brightness temperature.
<br />
<br />Units: K
<br />
<br />24) toa_brightness_temperature_bias_at_standard_scene_wrt_intercalibration
<br />
<br />The difference between top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature
<br />
of the reference sensor and TOA brightness temperature of the
<br />
monitored sensor. This TOA brightness temperature difference is a
<br />
measure of the calibration difference between the monitored and
<br />
reference sensors. Standard scene is a target area with typical Earth
<br />
surface and atmospheric conditions that is accepted as a reference.
<br />
Brightness temperature of a body is the temperature of a black body
<br />
which radiates the same power per unit solid angle per unit area at a
<br />
given wavenumber. TOA brightness temperature of the standard scene is
<br />
calculated using a radiative transfer simulation for a given viewing
<br />
geometry. The resultant top-of-atmosphere spectral radiance is then
<br />
integrated with each sensor's spectral response function and converted
<br />
to equivalent brightness temperature.
<br />
<br />Units: K
