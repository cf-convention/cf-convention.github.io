Dear Cecelia et al.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; An &quot;entirely unproblematic&quot; calendar attribute such as days since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2012-1-1 could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite problematic if it is March 1, if it is unclear if you are on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gregorian, no leap,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or 360 day calendar, all in active use in modeling and all yielding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potentially different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answers.  A no default strategy might lessen the chances for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mismatches (or at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least, steer people from the implicit assumption that dates are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to be Gregorian).
</em><br />
<br />Clearly I should be more precise in what I say!
<br />
<br />When I said &quot;entirely unproblematic&quot; in this case I meant that the mixed
<br />
Julian-Gregorian calendar was not a problem for it. If it is known to be in
<br />
the real world, it is well-defined, because it is later than the change from
<br />
Julian to Gregorian in all countries. I agree of course that Gregorian, 360-,
<br />
365- and 366-day calendars would all give different answers still. Hence that
<br />
choice does have to be clear.
<br />
<br />I do think that it would be right to deprecate the use of the mixed Julian-
<br />
Gregorian calendar for all cases except where there is really a need for time
<br />
coordinates before the change of calendar. There may be no such cases (as I
<br />
agree in my previous posting, to Steve) but we cannot be sure and I would
<br />
guess it might occasionally be needed.
<br />
<br />I don't think deprecation (which should be done anyway) changes my own view
<br />
about the default. I think the default should be the real world *but* I think
<br />
it would be fine to redefine the default to exclude the mixed calendar (i.e.
<br />
make it strict Gregorian). Allowing strict Gregorian to go back to 1582 is the
<br />
most generous choice. We could choose a later date. However, since Greece and
<br />
Russia (and maybe elsewhere) changed in the 20th century, we cannot choose a
<br />
date that is both late enough to avoid the transition in all countries and
<br />
early enough to include the period of instrumental data, which goes back to
<br />
the 19th century and earlier, for which there is a very likely need in CF.
<br />
Thus 1582 seems a simple and logical choice, and still helps as it would make
<br />
reference dates of year 0 and 1 fail. I suspect they are the commonest
<br />
choices that are made when the reference date has not been specifically chosen
<br />
to suit the data.
<br />
<br />I've probably said all this before, but to summarise, my first choice would
<br />
be to change the default to be strict Gregorian from 1582, which excludes the
<br />
worst problem, but if others argue that there is need to prevent confusion
<br />
between real-world and model calendars for reference dates more recent than
<br />
1582, I would accept my second choice, which is not to allow a default at all.
<br />
That's my second choice because I think it would cause annoyance for many
<br />
people who've been used to coding COARDS-like real-world time coordinates
<br />
without defining their calendar, whose datasets might become illegal, either
<br />
because their software is upgraded to use the new version of CF in which this
<br />
change is made, or because their software changes its default behaviour without
<br />
paying attention to the Conventions attribute, as Chris also mentions.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
