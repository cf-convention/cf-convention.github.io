<br />
Folks,
<br />
<br />I'm posting this to the list, rather than the ticket, as the ticket
<br />
had gotten huge, and it looks like it may be closed/restarted/split up
<br />
anyway. Also, this, perhaps, a more general question/thought.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; This illustrates my point.  I am not advocating a discussion here on how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  to represent time, instead I am advocating that the data model does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  take on this question at all, it is for implementations to deal with.
</em><br />
<br />My idea/confusion is about what the difference is between a data
<br />
model, and a particular implimentation -- i.e in this case, we have
<br />
the netcdf CF standard -- that is an implimentation of (theoretically)
<br />
a CF data model.
<br />
<br />But if we define the data model and netcdf implementation to be
<br />
identical, then there is no point in having a data model as a unique
<br />
concept.
<br />
<br />But I do like having a data model, and the original title of this
<br />
ticket outlines why -- with an independently defined data model, we
<br />
can have implementation in Python, or your language of choice, that is
<br />
independent of the specific storage format, etc. Ideally, that would
<br />
mean that one coudl work with such an implementation in a nice natural
<br />
way.
<br />
<br />So on to an example -- for axes -- datetime is a common axis to want
<br />
to use for the kind of data we're trying to deal with here -- working
<br />
with an abstraction of a data model, I want to work with the time axis
<br />
in a natural way -- that would be a datetime type of some sort -- in
<br />
fact, pretty much the first thing I ever do when reading in a netcdf
<br />
CF file, isto convertt eh time axis to python datetime -- I don't want
<br />
my client code to have to deal with whether the units are seconds or
<br />
days, or ??? -- that's what a datetime type is for.
<br />
<br />So I think the data model, in this case, should define the concept of
<br />
a time axis, which has datetime types of some sort -- they are
<br />
sortable, differentiable, etc. in Python, for instance, they might be
<br />
an array of numpy datetime64 types, or a python list of
<br />
datetime,datetime objects.
<br />
<br />But in CF-netcdf, we have &quot;timedelta since datetime&quot; as the standard
<br />
-- so we can store datetime axis with standard numerical types. fine,
<br />
but is that the data model? or is that a particular encoding for a
<br />
particular file format? I think the later.
<br />
<br />Example: unicode provides a data model for text -- a set of code
<br />
points, etc. With a modern programing language, you can work with text
<br />
in unicode objects -- a sequence of characters, etc. You don't need to
<br />
know about how they are internally encoded. However, when you want to
<br />
do I/O, you do need to know about encoding. So a file format
<br />
specification, and the tools to work with that format, need to specify
<br />
and handle the encoding/decoding for you.
<br />
<br />I think we should take a similar approach to netcdf-CF -- in a netcdf
<br />
file, time axes are encoded as &quot;timedelta since datetime&quot;, but in the
<br />
data model, they are an abstract datetime type. In other formats that
<br />
support the data model, one might well choose a different &quot;encoding&quot;.
<br />
(maybe iso strings, but I rather NOT have that in netcdf files --
<br />
leave it to libraries to convert different encodings for you)
<br />
<br />I've focused on time axes -- I do think that datetimes are a common
<br />
enough case that special treatment is warranted, but maybe there are
<br />
others, or a generalization that could be used.
<br />
<br />Another example:
<br />
<br />This is a bit of a side issue, but may be relvant. On the numpy list
<br />
there is discussion about casting rules -- when to upcast, for
<br />
example, an 8-bit integer to a larger integer. One driving example is
<br />
HDF files -- apparently it' s common to store data in small integers,
<br />
along with a scale and offset that will transform the the natural data
<br />
coordinates. (this is done in CF, too, yes?) The problem arrises when
<br />
you load up an array of 8 bit integers, then multiply and add the
<br />
scale and offset -- you can very easily end up overflowing your data
<br />
type if you're not careful.
<br />
<br />My thoughts on this is that the &quot;small integer plus shift and scale&quot;
<br />
should be thought of like an encoding, and should be hidden from the
<br />
user end -- the data model should reflect the real values, and the I/O
<br />
library should handle the encoding/decoding for you -- i.e. user code
<br />
should be able to get, for instance, the voltage from a sensor, in an
<br />
appropriate type, with the scaling/shifting applied, and not have to
<br />
know or care about how it was stored in the file.
<br />
<br />Of course, it should also be possible to access the raw data as
<br />
stored, but that should require explicit  access, and can assume that
<br />
the user knows what they are doing.
<br />
<br />So: in short -- the CF data model should be more general, and deal
<br />
with data concepts, separate from encoding of those data. File formats
<br />
should specify encoding, and libraries should handle
<br />
encoding/decoding.
<br />
