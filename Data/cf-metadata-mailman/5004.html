<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Nan,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with Roy that CF should be the default namespace in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; CF compliant file...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does that mean?
</em><br />
<br />It means that the definitions of attributes and variable names in a
<br />
CF file should first be assumed to be from CF, and for those that are
<br />
not, should be found in the other conventions specified in the file.
<br />
For my files, this means the conventions listed in the global attribute
<br />
Conventions, in order of their appearance there, with CF being first.
<br />
<br />It is in response to a suggestion on this thread that CF attributes
<br />
be identified &quot;using a 'cf_' prefix&quot; - which I think is unnecessary.
<br />
<br />People who develop metadata extensions that overlay CF should plan
<br />
ahead to 'protect' terms they define against the possibility that the
<br />
term will be used (differently) by CF in some future rev. They can do
<br />
that by adding namespace information to their terms, e.g. sdn_some_term,
<br />
but CF shouldn't need to do that; so in that sense it can be considered
<br />
the default namespace.
<br />
<br />For a metadata extension like OceanSITES (OTS), we need to keep an eye
<br />
on CF developments with regard to the extra attributes we've defined.
<br />
In the unlikely event that at some point one of these is added to CF, and
<br />
the definition is not the same as the one we have in OTS, we may have a
<br />
problem. We can either stick with the previous version of CF, or revise
<br />
our term (possibly by prefixing it with a namespace identifier like 
<br />
'OTS_').
<br />
<br />We're in the process of doing something like this now,  to achieve
<br />
compliance with the NetCDF Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery
<br />
(NACDD, aka UDD)  - NACDD has some terms with the same definition as
<br />
OTS terms, so we're moving towards adopting those terms instead.  The
<br />
OTS version number in the Conventions attribute will be key for software
<br />
that needs to understand details of these files (although these could
<br />
be considered second-tier attributes - they don't affect understanding
<br />
the data in any way).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Until we agree on the meaning and mechanism of namespace-handling within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CF-compliant files and software, I fear that such statements do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provide much guidance at the practical, implementation level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, in a CF-compliant netcdf file it's possible to have named
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identifiers from the netCDF ontology (e.g. _FillValue), from the COARDS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontology (e.g. missing_value), from the CF ontology (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard_name), and from any number of additional ontologies that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens to reference (SDN, ISOxxx, Dublin Core, etc, etc). I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe it makes sense to bundle them all, by default, into some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notional CF namespace.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Do you see a need to identify the source of a term, other than to prevent
<br />
'collisions', where a term has different definitions in different standards
<br />
that are employed within a file?  Is there a practical use for explicitly
<br />
identifying the 'standard_name' attribute as being part of CF, rather than
<br />
NetCDF? How would you identify 'title' which is part of NetCDF, CF, *and*
<br />
NACDD?
<br />
<br />You've listed 3 types of standards here; CF is built on NetCDF and COARDS;
<br />
it's my understanding that CF by definition includes the terms (and their
<br />
definitions) of the others.  SDN (and NACDD, which we use in OTS) are
<br />
already CF-aware.  DC and ISO, being completely external to CF, could
<br />
be seen as potential problems; but DC is meant to work with existing
<br />
vocabularies, and I just don't see a potential 'collision' there  - am I
<br />
missing something?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the only solution lies in using netCDF-4's existing namespacing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism, namely groups (which idea has been proposed before). I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspect this too will have it's adherents and detractors!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ... and that this problem belongs to groups that are writing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extensions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you mean software extensions, or metadata extensions (profiles)?
</em><br />
Extensions to CF, so metadata
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, if you hand off responsibility to other groups (whatever and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wherever they may be) would we not end up with a myriad of incompatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solutions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Should more of these community conventions be added to CF?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm sure there are SDN and NACDD (data discovery) attributes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that would be helpful to some CF users; it would be awfully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nice to have a list of already-defined attributes - in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; place - to choose from when putting together a CF-based spec
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for a project.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would seem to be a good candidate, IMO:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html</a>
</em><br />
I was thinking that many of the terms in NACDD could be useful to
<br />
CF users, as optional global attributes. Before we began adopting
<br />
NACDD, I'd probably have included my own terms like  'start_time'
<br />
and 'file_version_date', where now we use 'time_coverage_start' and
<br />
'date_created'.  Does it make sense to help standardize these terms
<br />
by including them in CF, or should these be handled by different
<br />
domains, like data discovery?
<br />
<br />My own preference is to bundle them into CF, in part because it
<br />
ensures well-understood definitions, and a place to discuss them,
<br />
which are not always found in other conventions/communities.
<br />
<br />A second choice would be having a resource where terms from
<br />
the 'major' conventions could be accessed.  Roy's BODC server,
<br />
at <a href="http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_bodc_vocab/welcome.aspx">http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_bodc_vocab/welcome.aspx</a>*,
<br />
*and the MMI ontology server, at <a href="http://mmisw.org/orr/#b">http://mmisw.org/orr/#b</a>
<br />
both work fairly well for this.
<br />
<br />Cheers - Nan
