Thanks, Alison. After further consideration as well as discussion with some
<br />
of our water quality colleagues, I think the dimensionless units of NTU may
<br />
be better expressed in UDUNITS as &quot;1&quot; instead of &quot;1e-3&quot; (parts per
<br />
thousand) since the values normally range in the 0-10+ range (rather than
<br />
0.001-0.01+). So, I would modify the units to &quot;1&quot; and slightly modify your
<br />
proposed definition to the following:
<br />
<br />'Turbidity is a dimensionless quantity which is expressed in NTU
<br />
(Nephelometric Turbidity Units). Turbidity expressed in NTU is the
<br />
proportion of white light scattered back to a transceiver by the
<br />
particulate load in a body of water, represented on an arbitrary scale
<br />
referenced against measurements made in the laboratory on aqueous
<br />
suspensions of formazine beads. Sea water turbidity may also be measured by
<br />
the quantity with standard name secchi_depth_of_sea_water.'
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
John

<br />
<br />Dear John and Roy,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your comments. Based on the explanations you have provided I
<br />
suggest that the wording of the definition should be 'Turbidity is a
<br />
dimensionless quantity which is expressed in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity
<br />
Units), which are normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand.
<br />
Turbidity expressed in NTU is the proportion of white light scattered back
<br />
to a transceiver by the particulate load in a body of water, represented on
<br />
an arbitrary scale referenced against measurements made in the laboratory
<br />
on aqueous suspensions of formazine beads. Sea water turbidity may also be
<br />
measured by the quantity with standard name secchi_depth_of_sea_water.'
<br />
<br />I suggest also that we could improve the definition of the secchi_depth
<br />
name to make it clearer that the quantity relates to turbidity and add a
<br />
cross-reference to the new name:
<br />
secchi_depth_of_sea_water - ' Depth is the vertical distance below the
<br />
surface. A Secchi disk is a patterned disk that is used to measure water
<br />
transparency, also called turbidity, in oceans and lakes. The disk is
<br />
lowered into the water and the depth at which the pattern is no longer
<br />
visible is the called the secchi depth. Sea water turbidity may also be
<br />
measured by the quantity with standard name sea_water_turbidity.'
<br />
<br />Do you agree?
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<br />Yes, I agree with Roy's assessment. Thank you.

<br />Hello Alison,
<br />
<br />I had been hanging back waiting for John to respond to Jonathan's comment,
<br />
because nephelometric turbidity is a phenomenon that I've seen described -
<br />
but not necessarily defined - in a couple of different ways. ?However,
<br />
whilst both turbidity and secchi disk depth (and attenuance to the matter)
<br />
have values related to the SPM load in the water body, they differ markedly
<br />
for a given SPM load and so I think a new standard name is justified.
<br />
<br />As a prompt, I'll give one of my understandings of turbidity in NTU, which
<br />
is 'The proportion of white light scattered back to the transceiver by the
<br />
particulate load in a body of water, represented on an arbitrary scale
<br />
referenced against measurements made in the laboratory on aqueous
<br />
suspensions of formazine beads.' ?Before going any further we need John to
<br />
either confirm that this is what he means or come up with an alternative.
<br />
?Others might also have their own ideas....
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />
<br />Dear John,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your proposal.
<br />
<br />We currently have one existing standard name relating to turbidity of sea
<br />
water, secchi_depth_of_sea_water, which has units of metres and is defined
<br />
as ?Depth is the vertical distance below the surface. A Secchi disk is a
<br />
patterned disk that is used to measure water transparency in oceans and
<br />
lakes. The disk is lowered into the water and the depth at which the
<br />
pattern is no longer visible is the called the secchi depth.?
<br />
<br />I agree with Jonathan that it would be helpful if you could provide a
<br />
(fairly brief) definition for the new name or perhaps a suitable reference.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<br />Dear CF-Metadata,
<br />
I would propose the addition of &quot;sea_water_turbidity&quot; to the CF Standard
<br />
Names. This has units of NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units), which would
<br />
be represented in UDUNITS as &quot;1e-3&quot; (similar to how sea_water_salinity is
<br />
in PSS (or PSU) and commonly represented as 1e-3).
<br />
Thanks,
<br />
