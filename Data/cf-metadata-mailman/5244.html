<br />
Dear all
<br />
<br />Jim asked,
<br />
<br />&quot;As some examples of the confusing situation we have now, why do we have a
<br />
separate word modifier number_of_observations instead of a
<br />
number_of_observations_of_X transformation modifier?  Why don't we have
<br />
variance_of_X or anomaly_of_X transformations (or separate word modifiers
<br />
variance or anomaly)?  Why isn't there a cell method for standard error?  I
<br />
can't discern any logic behind the current partitioning.&quot;
<br />
<br />I've tried to explain how this came about, but perhaps I am not being clear,
<br />
so let me try again:
<br />
<br />* We introduced the modifiers like number_of_observations for those situations
<br />
where it was thought likely that a large number of standard names would need
<br />
them. Factorising out this dimension thus avoids a large expansion of the
<br />
standard name table. So far, only four anomaly_of names have been requested,
<br />
so it seems the right judgement not to have a standard_name modifier for that.
<br />
<br />* That was also one of the motivations for cell_methods: there would be vastly
<br />
more standard names if we had to include all the cell_methods information too.
<br />
The other motivation for cell_methods is that the statistical operations
<br />
relate to particular axes. For instance, just &quot;mean&quot; is too vague: does it
<br />
mean time-mean, zonal-mean, mean over radiation wavelength, or what? The same
<br />
is true for variance. The cell_methods attribute makes this precise.
<br />
<br />* There is not a cell method for standard error because it does not relate to
<br />
a particular dimension. The standard error is a metadata property of the
<br />
individual data. The cell methods statistically describe the variation of the
<br />
quantity within cells. These are different purposes.
<br />
<br />While you may not agree with the logic, does this help to explain what it is?
<br />
<br />If the situation is perceived as confusing and easily misunderstood, I am all
<br />
in favour of clarifying it by inserting more explanation and discussion in the
<br />
CF standard document. That could be done with a defect ticket. As Philip says,
<br />
it could shorten future discussions.
<br />
<br />But we can also change the standard, of course. However, changes to existing
<br />
attributes are difficult for existing software. I do not think we need or
<br />
ought to change the existing attributes. While I appreciate the reason for the
<br />
suggestion, I feel that suffixing something to the standard_name to indicate
<br />
&quot;something&quot; has been done to it would not really help, because there is almost
<br />
*always* something done to it! Cell methods are recommended to be specified in
<br />
any case where the default &quot;point&quot; or &quot;sum&quot; is not correct. They should be
<br />
present if the quantity is a mean, in particular. A mean is also a
<br />
transformation, just like a standard deviation.
<br />
<br />I am not convinced yet by the argument that we have to modify the CF standard
<br />
because the standard_name may be misunderstood or misused by software which
<br />
catalogues or serves datasets. CF introduced the standard_name attribute. If
<br />
it's being used now, software must already have been modified to support CF.
<br />
Well then, why can't be modified again to support CF more fully or correctly?
<br />
If we explained more clearly in the standard what the intention was, that would
<br />
no doubt help with future software design.
<br />
<br />Instead of changing what we have, I think we should add to it. It seems to me,
<br />
as I've said before, that the existing proposal for &quot;CF strings&quot; summarising
<br />
some essential metadata (similar to the earlier proposal for common concepts
<br />
in some ways) would solve this problem. It is *that* kind of string, not the
<br />
standard name, that the user should be offered to select an appropriate
<br />
variable. It's a combination of attributes. It's not hard to assemble that
<br />
information from the separate attributes, but if that's an obstacle, we could
<br />
help software over it by recommending that this extra attribute be included.
<br />
<br />Please have a look at <a href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/94">https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/94</a> and add your
<br />
comments on it.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
