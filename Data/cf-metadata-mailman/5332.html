Dear Mark et al.
<br />
<br />Others may not be aware we have been discussing this for a long time in ticket
<br />
95, about the CF data model. I think it's important to be clear that this
<br />
discussion is concerned with how CF-netCDF files are interpreted, in an
<br />
abstract sense. That has implications for the design of software which is
<br />
sympathetic to CF, but it doesn't affect the compliance of CF-netCDF files.
<br />
<br />I think that the statement in sect 5.7 is the definitive one, which you quoted.
<br />
&quot;When a variable has an associated coordinate which is single-valued, that
<br />
coordinate may be represented as a scalar variable. ... The new scalar
<br />
coordinate variable is a convenience feature which avoids adding size one
<br />
dimensions to variables. Scalar coordinate variables have the same information
<br />
content and can be used in the same contexts as a size one coordinate
<br />
variable.&quot; I think that makes it clear that a scalar coordinate variable is
<br />
regarded as logically equivalent to a size-one (Unidata) coordinate variable.
<br />
I'm certain that is what we had in mind when we wrote that text. If that is
<br />
what Mark's option B means, then I vote for option B. But I find option B a
<br />
bit unclear in saying a scalar coordinate variable &quot;...  explicitly declares a
<br />
dimension of size one&quot;. The point is, it does not *declare* the dimension. As
<br />
the rest of the sentence says, &quot;the dimension is not stated in the file&quot;.
<br />
<br />We intended it for just the kind of case that Seth describes e.g. air
<br />
temperature at 2 m height. It's convenient to record this kind of thing as a
<br />
scalar coordinate variable, because it means you don't have clutter up the
<br />
file and the data variable declaration with size-one dimensions. It's useful
<br />
that it is a coordinate variable, because that means it can have a
<br />
standard_name, units and bounds. These are equivalent in information content:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;float height; // scalar coordinate variable
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height: standard_name=&quot;height&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float temp(lat,lon);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temp: standard_name=&quot;air_temperature&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temp: coordinates=&quot;height&quot;;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;float height(height);  // size-one coordinate var, with dimension height=1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height: standard_name=&quot;height&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float temp(height,lat,lon);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temp: standard_name=&quot;air_temperature&quot;;
<br />
<br />So I think there is an implied dimension, which we're not putting in the file
<br />
because we don't need it. Although if this is an observational dataset, there
<br />
may only ever be one height, as Seth says, if it was a slice of one level out
<br />
of a model dataset, it's natural to think of it as having a size-one dimension
<br />
which is omitted from the file. If you had one-level slices in different data
<br />
variables, you might want to join them together and reconstruct the height
<br />
dimension. It doesn't make any difference to the file; it's just how you think
<br />
about it.
<br />
<br />In the example that Richard gives, there are choices which the writer of the
<br />
file could record concerning the time, forecast_reference_time and
<br />
forecast_period. Leaving out of consideration the cases where both
<br />
forecast_period and forecast_reference_time are multi-valued (the document
<br />
Steve pointed to is about that):
<br />
<br />(a) If there are many forecast_periods from one forecast_reference_time, then
<br />
forecast_reference_time could be a size-one or scalar coord var, and either
<br />
time or forecast_period could be a (Unidata) coord var, with the other being
<br />
an aux coord var of the same dimension.
<br />
<br />(b) If there are forecasts at the same forecast_period with various
<br />
forecast_reference_times, then forecast_period could be a size-one or scalar
<br />
coord var, and either time or forecast_reference_time a (Unidata) coord var,
<br />
with the other being an aux coord var of the same dimension.
<br />
<br />In these cases, it's well-defined how the three variables are grouped.
<br />
Richard is interested in the degenerate case when none of them is
<br />
multi-valued. That case could be written as (a) or (b). In practice, it may
<br />
naturally be (a) or (b), because it's a single time-slice from a system that
<br />
produces one or the other. If that's so, it's useful for the data-writer to
<br />
indicate it, I would say. In order to record that two of the size-one
<br />
coordinates are related, you must have an explicit dimension of size one,
<br />
with one of them a (Unidata) coord var and the other an auxiliary. But, as
<br />
Richard says, in this special case you could make all three of them coord
<br />
vars or scalar coord vars. I think that would be less informative, so it
<br />
doesn't seem better to me. But it's allowed, of course. The data-writer can
<br />
make a choice. The user of the data can aggregate it however he/she pleases.
<br />
That's not a decision which is up to the data-writer or the CF convention.
<br />
<br />I think the description of size-one string-valued auxiliary coordinate
<br />
variables in sect 6.1 is careless (that's my fault - I wrote it) because it
<br />
doesn't point out that coordinate variables can't be string-valued. That could
<br />
be amended in a defect ticket. A string-value scalar coordinate variable is a
<br />
1D character array (dimensioned by string length). I think it is logically
<br />
equivalent to a size-one string-valued auxiliary coordinate variable, which is
<br />
a 2D character array in which one of the dimensions is string length and the
<br />
other is a size-one dimension of the data variable.  Again, it's a convenience
<br />
feature which allows you to avoid adding a dimension to the file.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
