Dear Mark
<br />
<br />As when we have discussed this before, I am certain that when we introduced
<br />
scalar coordinate variables, we intended them to mean the same thing as
<br />
size-one coordinate variables. Though I do not remember the actual discussions
<br />
I am sure that's what we had in mind, and it is quite likely that it was me
<br />
who drafted the words currently in the document with that intention.
<br />
<br />I agree that subsequently the introduction of string-valued scalar coordinate
<br />
variables muddied the picture. Again it was probably me who drafted the words
<br />
and I'm sorry those words are a bit careless and not clearer. However, I am
<br />
sure, again, this was intended as a convenience feature, not intended to imply
<br />
any new sort of information. For example, if you want to label a geographical
<br />
region with a string-valued coordinate of region, having value atlantic_ocean
<br />
for example, this must be an auxiliary coordinate variable, because it is
<br />
string-valued. The idea is that
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;basin=1;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;maxlength=30;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float sf(basin,depth,latitude);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sf:standard_name=&quot;ocean_meridional_overturning_streamfunction&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sf:units=&quot;1e6 m3 s-1&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sf:coordinates=&quot;basinname&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;char basinname(basin,maxlength);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basinname:standard_name=&quot;region&quot;;
<br />
<br />can be more conveniently encoded as
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;maxlength=30;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float sf(depth,latitude);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sf:standard_name=&quot;ocean_meridional_overturning_streamfunction&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sf:units=&quot;1e6 m3 s-1&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sf:coordinates=&quot;basinname&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;char basinname(maxlength);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basinname:standard_name=&quot;region&quot;;
<br />
<br />which fairly obviously means the same thing, I would say, so it is reasonable
<br />
to regard basinname as an auxiliary coordinate variable of a size-one dimension
<br />
which has been omitted for convenience. I didn't write this down in my last
<br />
posting, for the sake of simplicity.
<br />
<br />You argue that because the words are unclear people have made use of the
<br />
flexibility to introduce scalar coordinates without deciding whether they are
<br />
functionally equivalent to (Unidata) coordinate variables or auxiliary
<br />
coordinate variables. As I argued in my last posting, I think there is an
<br />
advantage if the data-writer indicates the association between these size-one
<br />
coordinates, if there is one, by using a size-one dimension. However, the
<br />
data-writer may choose not to do so, and that's fine. In that case, the
<br />
data-writer has decided to omit some potentially useful information.
<br />
<br />My interpretation, if there are n scalar coordinates, is that they imply n
<br />
independent dimensions. However, it seems to me that it is no big deal, when
<br />
you read the file, to decide you don't like that interpretation, and instead
<br />
group them in some way of your choice into m (Unidata) coordinate variables
<br />
and p auxiliary coordinate variables, with m+p=n. This will not affect the
<br />
data, so it is easy to do.
<br />
<br />The difference between our points of view is this, as far as I understand:
<br />
<br />* I think there are (Unidata) coordinate variables, and auxiliary coordinate
<br />
variables, and scalar coordinate variables are a way to encode these without
<br />
defining a netCDF dimension of size one.
<br />
<br />* You think that scalar coordinate variables are in a third class of their own.
<br />
<br />We agree that it makes no difference to the data. It's just a matter of
<br />
interpretation. I favour my interpretation because it has one fewer abstract
<br />
concept (so it is simpler), and because I think it is the most obvious
<br />
interpretation of what the standard means by saying scalar coordinates are
<br />
functionally equivalent to size-one coordinates (as well as being certain that
<br />
is what the standard was *intended* to mean, when the words were written).
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
