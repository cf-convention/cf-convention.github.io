Dear Mark
<br />
<br />We still have a difference in our interpretation of scalar coordinates. Maybe
<br />
this is irreconcilable, but I am reluctant to reach that conclusion. The
<br />
reason why this is hard to settle is that, as we have agreed, it has no
<br />
implication at all for the netCDF file. It is just a matter of interpretation.
<br />
It's hard to decide because we are not constrained by the file format. The
<br />
constraints come from what you do with the data, and what design you would
<br />
like for data analysis software.
<br />
<br />Our difference is about whether scalar coordinate variables represent a CF
<br />
construct of their own, or whether they are a convenient way of representing
<br />
size-one dimension coordinate constructs and size-one string-valued auxiliary
<br />
coordinate constructs, which are normally stored respectively as (Unidata
<br />
convention) coordinate variables and (CF) string-valued auxiliary coordinate
<br />
variables. As discussed, I don't recall an intention, when scalar coordinates
<br />
were introduced, that they would be a new kind of thing; they were intended to
<br />
be handy way of encoding an existing kind of thing, and that is what the words
<br />
in the standard document still suggest to me.
<br />
<br />Therefore I think we need only two concepts and scalar coordinates are not a
<br />
third concept. I argue for this because it's simpler (applying Occam's razor,
<br />
if you like). We need only those two concepts to describe coordinate variables
<br />
in CF-netCDF files.
<br />
<br />That means you have to decide which kind a scalar coordinate variable is
<br />
representing. I think the convention (up to CF 1.5 - see DSG email) implies
<br />
that if it's a numeric scalar, it's a size-one dimension coordinate construct,
<br />
and if it's a single string, it's a size-one auxiliary coordinate construct.
<br />
<br />You are concerned this restricts your flexibility. I see why you say that, of
<br />
course, but practically speaking I don't think it does. You can't leave it
<br />
undecided what a scalar coordinate means (according to my view), but nothing
<br />
prevents you from following a different interpretation to the above when you
<br />
read the file. That may mean you have adopted a different view from the person
<br />
who created the file, but if that person did not *want* to make it clear what
<br />
sort it was (which is what you suggest) then surely he or she does not mind
<br />
which interpretation you adopt. Equally, you can read the file with one
<br />
interpretation, and then change your mind when it's in memory, by converting
<br />
dimension coordinate constructs to auxiliaries or vice-versa, creating or
<br />
dropping size-one dimensions. This is all easy to do in memory. The data is
<br />
completely unaffected, apart from being possibly reshaped by the insertion or
<br />
removal of size-one dimensions. It just shuffles the metadata around.
<br />
<br />It matters when you come to aggregate different variables, within a file or
<br />
from different files. For instance, you can't aggregate two variables that have
<br />
different scalar values of both experiment_id and ensemble_member_number unless
<br />
you decide that these are both auxiliary coordinate variables of the same
<br />
(omitted) size-one dimension. On the other hand, if you have four data
<br />
variables, showing all the possible combinations of two scalars,
<br />
(experiment_id 1, ensemble_member_number 1)
<br />
(experiment_id 1, ensemble_member_number 2)
<br />
(experiment_id 2, ensemble_member_number 1)
<br />
(experiment_id 2, ensemble_member_number 2)
<br />
you may wish to aggregate them with two size-2 dimensions. Thus, you may need
<br />
to change the interpretation of scalars, in order to enable the aggregation or
<br />
determine how it's done. But to get that flexibility doesn't require that
<br />
initially you were undecided about what the scalars mean. It only needs you to
<br />
be able change your mind about what they mean, which is easy to do (last
<br />
paragraph).  Aggregation of data variables is *not* part of the CF standard
<br />
(at the moment).  Therefore what you do about this lies in the realm of
<br />
software design, which can adopt its own rules, which the writer of the data
<br />
can't influence.
<br />
<br />Once the data is in memory, you can do what you like. You might wish to be
<br />
flexible about interpretation of multi-valued coordinates, not just
<br />
scalars. For instance, you might want to combine two data variables (lat,lon)
<br />
with different lat and lon coordinate variables and dimensions, by flattening
<br />
them both, to make lat and lon auxiliaries of a discrete (index) axis. That's
<br />
not how the data was written, but so what? It might be convenient for the use
<br />
of the data. It doesn't imply the coordinate variables to be of unspecific
<br />
meaning in the first place.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
