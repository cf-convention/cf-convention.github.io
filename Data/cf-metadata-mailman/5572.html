<br />Hi Jonathan,
<br />
<br />I think you're right, _wrt_surface is probably clearer than _from_the_surface.
<br />
&nbsp;It's
<br />
also shorter, which is never a bad thing.
<br />
<br />I can't think of a good suffix for the general (non-surface-based) names, but I
<br />
think we can still avoid redefining the existing name by removing _specific_
<br />
from my proposed new names.  It seems to have been added simply because
<br />
CAPE has units with kg in the denominator, rather than because it needs to 
<br />
be distinguished from some kind of non-specific CAPE.  (Likewise, the sentence
<br />
in the definition defining potential energy seems to be automatic boilerplate,
<br />
rather than an important clarification.)
<br />
<br />So I've revised the definitions below to remove _specific_ from the CAPE &amp;
<br />
CIN names, and have made sure that it's clear from the definitions why they
<br />
have the units they do (since it's not obvious from the explanation of how
<br />
they are calculated).
<br />
<br />If that's an acceptable way to handle this issue, we can then make 
<br />
atmosphere_specific_convective_available_potential_energy an alias to
<br />
atmosphere_convective_available_potential_energy_wrt_surface. 
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />--Seth

<br />original_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Various stability and convective potential indices are calculated by
<br />
&quot;lifting&quot; a parcel of air: moving it dry adiabatically from a starting
<br />
height (often the surface) to the Lifting Condensation Level, and then
<br />
wet adiabatically from there to a final height (often the top of the
<br />
troposphere).  original_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel is the pressure
<br />
height at the start of lifting.
<br />
<br />canonical units: Pa

&quot;lifting&quot; a parcel of air: moving it dry adiabatically from a starting
<br />
height (often the surface) to the Lifting Condensation Level, and then

height at the end of lifting.
<br />
<br />canonical units: Pa
<br />
<br /><br />#####
<br />
<br />atmosphere_convective_inhibition
<br />
<br />Convective inhibition is the amount of energy per unit mass required
<br />
to overcome the negatively buoyant energy exerted by the environment
<br />
on a parcel of air.  Convective inhibition is often abbreviated as
<br />
&quot;CIN&quot; or &quot;CINH&quot;.  It is calculated by integrating the negative
<br />
temperature difference between the surrounding atmosphere and a parcel
<br />
of air lifted adiabatically from a given starting height to its
<br />
equilibrium level. A coordinate variable of
<br />
original_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel should be specified to indicate
<br />
the starting height of the lifted parcel.
<br />
<br />canonical units: J kg-1
<br />

<br /><br />#####
<br />
<br />atmosphere_lifting_condensation_level
<br />
<br />The lifting condensation level is the height at which the relative
<br />
humidity of an air parcel cooled by dry adiabatic lifting would reach
<br />
100%.  A coordinate variable of original_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel
<br />
should be specified to indicate the starting height of the lifted
<br />
parcel.
<br />
<br />canonical units: m
<br />
<br /><br />#####
<br />
<br />atmosphere_lifting_condensation_level_wrt_surface
<br />
<br />The lifting condensation level is the height at which the relative
<br />
humidity of an air parcel cooled by dry adiabatic lifting from the
<br />
surface would reach 100%.
<br />
<br />canonical units: m
<br />
<br /><br />#####
<br />
<br />atmosphere_level_of_free_convection
<br />
<br />The level of free convection is the altitude where the temperature of
<br />
the environment decreases faster than the moist adiabatic lapse rate
<br />
of a saturated air parcel at the same level.  It is calculated by
<br />
lifting a parcel of air dry adiabatically to the LCL (lifting
<br />
condensation level), then moist adiabatically until the parcel
<br />
temperature is equal to the ambient temperature.  A coordinate
<br />
variable of original_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel should be specified
<br />
to indicate the starting height of the lifted parcel.
<br />
<br />canonical units: m
<br />
<br /><br />#####

<br />atmosphere_level_of_free_convection_wrt_surface
<br />
<br />The level of free convection is the altitude where the temperature of
<br />
the environment decreases faster than the moist adiabatic lapse rate
<br />
of a saturated air parcel at the same level.  It is calculated by
<br />
lifting a parcel of air dry adiabatically from the surface to the LCL
<br />
(lifting condensation level), then moist adiabatically until the
<br />
parcel temperature is equal to the ambient temperature.

<br />[This new standard_name replaces
<br />
atmosphere_specific_convective_available_potential_energy]
<br />
<br />atmosphere_convective_available_potential_energy
<br />
<br />Convective(ly) available potential energy (often abbreviated CAPE) is
<br />
a stability measure calculated by integrating the positive temperature
<br />
difference between the surrounding atmosphere and a parcel of air
<br />
lifted adiabatically from a given starting height to its equilibrium
<br />
level. A coordinate variable of original_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel
<br />
should be specified to indicate the starting height of the lifted
<br />
parcel. CAPE exists under conditions of potential instability, and
<br />
measures the potential energy per unit mass that would be released by
<br />
the unstable parcel if it were able to convect upwards to equilibrium.
<br />
<br />canonical units: J kg-1
