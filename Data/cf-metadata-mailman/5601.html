Jonathan: 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I see your point.  Specific AOD values/pixels in the cell are not 
<br />
contingent on the time period associated with sensing the region (i.e. 
<br />
cell). 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The question that then comes up is whether the AOD values for individual 
<br />
observations/pixels in the source data for the region are instantaneous or 
<br />
average values.  I think there is an argument to be made for either &quot;time: 
<br />
point&quot; or &quot;time: mean&quot;.  While it may be true that individual observations 
<br />
in the source data are a result of subsampling by the sensing instrument 
<br />
over intervals of less than a second and resampling by ground processing 
<br />
software, these in-depth technical details are of little use to the users 
<br />
of the data.  From their perspective, treating the individual 
<br />
observations/pixels in the source data as instantaneous values is 
<br />
satisfactory and is the least likely to cause confusion. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />So here is the updated declaration of the cell_methods attribute: 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />cell_methods = &quot;time: point area: minimum (interval: 2 km 
<br />
comment:solar_zenith_angle and platform_zenith_angle conforming pixels 
<br />
only)&quot; ; 
<br />
<br />very respectfully, 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
<br />Dear Randy
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The cell method &quot;sum&quot; is applied to the &quot;time&quot; and &quot;y&quot; and &quot;x&quot; coordinate 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables The reason &quot;sum&quot; is used for the &quot;time&quot; coordinate variable is 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the sensing of a region (i.e.cell) occurs over a several minute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; period. The sensing associated with a particular observation/pixel in the 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; region (i.e. cell) happens in less than a second. Statistics associated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this cell in time are really an accumulation over the several minute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensing period.
</em><br />
<br />OK, I see. The observation is a formed from a sum. Nonetheless, is the
<br />
geophysical quantity really a sum? Is it extensive in time? For instance, 
<br />
if
<br />
conditions stayed exactly the same, and the time interval was made twice 
<br />
as
<br />
long, would the reported value be twice as large? The units of aerosol 
<br />
optical
<br />
depth do not suggest that it depends on the length of the time interval 
<br />
like,
<br />
for instance, precipitation amount does.
<br />
<br />Best wishes

&nbsp;Dear Jonathan:   Thanks for taking the time to look at my long-winded 
<br />
post.  You posed a question I would like to answer:   Is &quot;sum&quot; really the 
<br />
right cell_method? I would have expected &quot;mean&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;The cell method &quot;sum&quot; is applied to the &quot;time&quot;  and &quot;y&quot; and &quot;x&quot; coordinate 
<br />
variables   The reason &quot;sum&quot; is used for the &quot;time&quot; coordinate variable is 
<br />
that the sensing of a region (i.e.cell) occurs over a several minute 
<br />
period.  The sensing associated with a particular observation/pixel in the 
<br />
region (i.e. cell) happens in less than a second.  Statistics associated 
<br />
this cell in time are really an accumulation over the several minute 
<br />
sensing period.   The use of &quot;sum&quot; for &quot;area&quot; in the example below is a 
<br />
mistake.  The example wss supposed to show the minimum AOD value for the 
<br />
region (i.e. cell) that was sensed over a several minute period.  I should 
<br />
have used &quot;minimum&quot;.   
<br />
<br />Here is the correction to the declaration of the cell_methods attribute: 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />cell_methods = &quot;time: sum area: minimum (interval: 2 km 
<br />
comment:solar_zenith_angle and platform_zenith_angle conforming pixels 
<br />
only)&quot; ;

<br />very respectfully,

gridded observation data
<br />
<br />Dear Randy
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The GOES-R ground system generates level 2+ products such as aerosol 
</em><br />
optical depth, for the hemispheric, continental US, and mesocale (100 km x 
<br />
1000 km) regions.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The NetCDF product files need to contain statistics (min, max, mean, and 
</em><br />
standard deviation) associated with ALL the gridded data associated with a 
<br />
region.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would seem the use of cell methods to express these statistics in the 
</em><br />
product file makes sense even though there is only one cell (i.e. the one 
<br />
cell that captures the statistic for the entire region).
<br />
<br />Yes, I agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is stated in the first sentence of CF standard para. 7.3.3 that the 
</em><br />
statistical method is evaluated over the entire horizontal area of the 
<br />
cell. In the case of our level 2+ products, this is not always the case, so 
<br />
we have a need to somehow express that the statistic is associated with a 
<br />
subset of the cell.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, in the case of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product, the 
</em><br />
algorithm that generates the gridded data is has solar zenith angle and 
<br />
platform zenith angle constraints.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Essentially, these statistics apply to a portion of the single cell. 
</em><br />
Unfortunately, the &quot;where &lt;area_type&gt;&quot; features discussed in CF standard 
<br />
para. 7.3.3 do not work for us because the AOD product constraints are 
<br />
associated with the solar zenith angle and platform zenith angle at the 
<br />
time of observation, not one of the area_types.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given the currently available cell method constructs, which allow for 
</em><br />
capturing the original spacing of the gridded data elements and the ability 
<br />
to include non-standardized information, we have applied the existing CF 
<br />
cell_method constructs as follow:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; float minimum_AOD_for_region ;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordinates = &quot;solar_zenith_angle platform_zenith_angle time y x&quot; ;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell_methods = &quot;time: sum area: sum (interval: 2 km 
</em><br />
comment:solar_zenith_angle and platform_zenith_angle conforming pixels 
<br />
only)&quot; ;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is the way we are applying cell methods consistent with the CF standard 
</em><br />
?
<br />
<br />Yes, I think that is fine, if it's OK for you to use non-standardised
<br />
information. This sort of application was the intention of the standard.
<br />
<br />Is &quot;sum&quot; really the right cell_method? I would have expected &quot;mean&quot;.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
