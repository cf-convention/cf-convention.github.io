<br />
NASA has recently convened an Earth Science Data System Working Group to
<br />
explore existing conventions for data and products stored in HDF and to
<br />
make recommendations for future developments. The CF Conventions are an
<br />
important element in this work, as many scientists and users are
<br />
interested in data products that comply with CF. Many members of the
<br />
working group are familiar with CF and have been involved in attempts to
<br />
apply the CF Conventions to a variety of Earth Science data products.
<br />
<br />We have identified a persistent barrier to NASA's greater adoption of
<br />
CF: the lack of protocols for exploiting software-defined group
<br />
hierarchies for data structures. HDF datasets traditionally collected
<br />
and stewarded by NASA often utilize hierarchical (the &quot;H&quot; in HDF)
<br />
groups. A chief advantage of netCDF4 over netCDF3 is that it supports a
<br />
group API compatible with HDF. Here we outline an approach to
<br />
incorporating groups into CF as a step towards recognizing and,
<br />
eventually, exploiting groups.
<br />
<br />Some aspects of CF (especially the netCDF Conventions like _FillValue,
<br />
valid_min) can apply unambiguously to HDF files that use groups, but
<br />
other aspects of CF conventions have room for ambiguity when applied to
<br />
such HDF files. Clarifying that ambiguity is one role of conventions, so
<br />
we would like to start a discussion with the aim of obtaining feedback,
<br />
gathering consensus, and eventually, possibly, embedding
<br />
&quot;group-awareness&quot; into CF. Unidata's white paper on Conventions for
<br />
netCDF4
<br />
(<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/papers/nc4_conventions.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/papers/nc4_conventions.html</a>) began
<br />
the discussion of potential &quot;group-aware&quot; CF capabilities. Some previous
<br />
discussion of &quot;group-aware&quot; CF metadata is contained or referenced in
<br />
CF-Metadata Trac tickets 79 (Handling and formatting of vector
<br />
quantities in CF) and 90 (Collection of CF enhancements for
<br />
interoperable applications) yet the &quot;big discussion&quot; on how/whether CF
<br />
should exploit the hierarchical group capabilities of netCDF4 is
<br />
unfinished. Below we propose a standard scheme for interpreting metadata
<br />
scope in hierarchical (group) files, and suggest one or two new Group
<br />
Attributes which we could turn into concrete proposals if interest warrants.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the most obvious place to start a discussion on making CF
<br />
&quot;group-aware&quot; is the notion of attribute scope: How ought metadata in
<br />
one group apply, if at all, to other groups? CF metadata attributes may
<br />
be applied at the group level (netCDF4 allows this) yet what should that
<br />
mean? Whereas the current CF Convention speaks only of Global Attributes
<br />
and Variable Attributes, a &quot;group-aware&quot; CF must explicitly define the
<br />
properties of a third category of attributes, Group Attributes. Global
<br />
Attributes are a special case of Group Attributes and should share their
<br />
properties.
<br />
<br />The key technical definition we propose is that Group Attributes shall
<br />
apply to the group where they are defined and to its descendents, but
<br />
not to that group's ancestors or siblings. Group Attributes apply to all
<br />
a group's descendents recursively with an exception: Any group may
<br />
redefine an attribute defined in an ancestor group, and that
<br />
child-group's definition applies to all its descendents. Thus in cases
<br />
where multiple ancestor groups define the same attribute, attribute
<br />
values are inherited from the nearest ancestor. Note that these are the
<br />
same scoping properties as netCDF4 dimensions.
<br />
<br />Our understanding is that this proposal is consistent and
<br />
backwards-compatible with CF. However, it would extend the current usage
<br />
of CF to files with arbitrary hierarchies of groups. Moreover, it might
<br />
be helpful to specifically disallow (or mark as having undefined
<br />
consequences) the use of Group Attributes to store metadata that should
<br />
always be attached directly to variables. Group Attributes such as
<br />
_FillValue, scale_factor, valid_min, might sometimes seem tempting yet
<br />
might create more problems than they would solve. Some attributes (e.g.,
<br />
Convention) may be useful only as Global Attributes, and not as Group
<br />
Attributes for other groups.
<br />
<br />What would a &quot;group-aware&quot; CF Convention mean in practice? It is
<br />
important to preserve CF backwards compatibility. The metadata
<br />
annotation of flat files (e.g., all netCDF3 files) need not be affected
<br />
by any &quot;group-aware&quot; CF Convention extensions.
<br />
<br />Files with group hierarchies would continue to have Global Attributes
<br />
(i.e., Group Attributes at the root group level). Global Attributes are
<br />
almost always useful because they apply to the entire file except where
<br />
superceded by an attribute of the same name at a lower level. Where
<br />
group-oriented attribute conventions would help, we believe, is in
<br />
extending the power of CF unambiguously to nested groups.
<br />
<br />Imagine a group file in which each top level group holds model results
<br />
from a distinct CMIP5 simulation (CCSM, ECMWF, GISS, etc.). Or where
<br />
each top level group holds a different satellite-retrieved value of the
<br />
same field (ERBE OLR, CERES OLR, etc.), or a different channel from the
<br />
same multi-spectral radiometer. It may be helpful to know the relation
<br />
of groups to other groups, so that users and tools can learn which are
<br />
(or aren't) intercomparable or aggregable. Properties of ensembles
<br />
stored as groups that would be helpful to know, in an automated way, by
<br />
analysis tools (such as NCO) include: Which groups contain the other
<br />
ensemble realizations? Which groups hold other channels of a
<br />
multi-spectral instrument? Knowing this information would help users and
<br />
analysis tools infer how best to create ensemble statistics, and could
<br />
significantly reduce the overall number of files confronting users.
<br />
<br />Finally, groups allow containerization of information which can be
<br />
useful in avoiding repetition. Some would like to define metadata-only
<br />
groups that could then be logically attached to apply to some or all
<br />
other groups in a file. Is it desirable for CF to define a standard way
<br />
to indicate this?
<br />
<br />As the previous examples illustrate, there are at least two levels to a
<br />
discussion about &quot;group-aware&quot; CF. The first is scope, i.e., how
<br />
attribute meanings are inherited in hierarchies. The second is the more
<br />
pragmatic issue of what new CF attributes would allow us to exploit
<br />
group hierarchies in a systematic way. We proposed an answer to the
<br />
scope issue to kickstart the discussion. We illustrated how a new
<br />
attribute (call it &quot;ensemble&quot; for now) might be useful. At this stage we
<br />
wish to learn whether CF users/developers are interested in pursuing
<br />
&quot;group-aware&quot; CF extensions at all before we develop more
<br />
details/wording for specific conventions. Perhaps there are others
<br />
working on similar issues, or perhaps the CF maintainers prefer to
<br />
receive specific wording of proposals rather than more diffuse
<br />
&quot;invitations to discuss&quot; like this. If you have an opinion, then please
<br />
let us know.
<br />
<br />Until the CF (or some other) Convention tackles the issues of scoping
<br />
and Group Attributes, such annotations will be ad hoc. Our goal is to
<br />
increase interoperability, and we are eager to hear responses from the
<br />
CF community on the direction of &quot;group-aware&quot; extensions to CF.
