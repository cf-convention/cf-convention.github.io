Hello,
<br />
<br />Thank you all for input on potentical &quot;group-aware&quot; CF extensions.
<br />
I do my best to respond to new points and apologies to those I miss.
<br />
New top-level thread to discuss use cases of, and potential solutions
<br />
to, research questions relevant to &quot;group-aware&quot; metadata.
<br />
<br />Some wish to see a compelling example of a feature that could best be
<br />
expressed with hierarchical groups. Let me supply one that scratches
<br />
my own itch. Others may have examples that are more persuasive to you,
<br />
or reasons why my example is not compelling, or is actually a
<br />
counter-example in disguise :)
<br />
<br />This will be a fuller example of the case for a CF ensemble feature.
<br />
Earlier I posted a &quot;rank 1&quot; ensemble example: an ensemble of datasets
<br />
produced by different models. This will be a &quot;rank 2&quot; ensemble, i.e.,
<br />
an ensemble of ensembles. It will be two models, named CESM and ECMWF,
<br />
each with two realizations of the same &quot;Historical&quot; time-period.
<br />
Realistic and possibly useful wrinkles to this would include adding
<br />
&quot;Historical&quot; observations of different shape to the mix, adding a
<br />
third ensemble axis (Scenario?), explicitly showing that model
<br />
datasets do not typically share spatial dimensions (i.e., different
<br />
spatial grids) but do often share time dimensions (e.g., daily,
<br />
monthly), and noting that ensembles can have different numbers of
<br />
realizations. These wrinkles are left to the reader's imagination
<br />
because they are not fundamental to motivating ensembles.
<br />
<br />An &quot;ensemble&quot; here means a group of datasets identical (perhaps
<br />
&quot;isomorphic&quot; would be better?) in structure, i.e., same variables and
<br />
dimensions. Normally, though not necessarily (metadata conventions
<br />
could be used to specify otherwise) ensemble members are assigned
<br />
equal statistical weights, e.g., simulation 1 is not preferred over
<br />
simulation 2, and model 1 is not preferred over model 2.
<br />
For example the two CESM datasets form an ensemble because they are
<br />
slightly different realizations of the same model. Although it could
<br />
be done differently, I will define the multi-model ensemble (MME) to
<br />
comprise two equally-weighted members, CESM and ECMWF.
<br />
<br />This is still simple enough to visualize yet gives a clearer idea of
<br />
how a hierarcical group structure compares to a flat structure.
<br />
Below are 2*2=4 CDL descriptions of raw datasets as they might appear
<br />
in a CF 1.x world of flat files and no &quot;ensemble&quot; metadata.
<br />
Then is a single 2-level deep hierarchical CDL file that contains
<br />
all four datasets but that serves purely as a container with no
<br />
inherited group metadata or dimensions. It's called mme_cnt.cdl (for
<br />
&quot;MME container&quot;). It could easily be created/aggregated (e.g., by
<br />
NCO's ncecat) from the four flat files it contains.
<br />
<br />I'll refrain from annotating mme_cnt.cdl with suggested &quot;group-aware&quot;
<br />
metadata, because it's a bit early for that. Instead I'll frame some
<br />
pertinent research questions and let those interested suggest answers
<br />
that may or may not imply &quot;group-aware&quot; metadata/storage solutions.
<br />
The mme_cnt.cdl file is provided as a bare-bones structure for
<br />
visualization purposes. Yes, hidden in its structure are intrinsic
<br />
relationships that can be used by the current netCDF4 library to
<br />
answer some of the questions posed below. That may be the subject
<br />
of a later post. For now let some prototypical research questions
<br />
steer our thinking to the best possible solution, and reserve for
<br />
later the question of how to store that solution on disk.
<br />
<br />Let us say a researcher's goal is to compute statistics on the CESM
<br />
ensemble, the ECMWF ensemble, and the multi-model ensemble (MME).
<br />
First the researcher needs to obtain the constituent files of the
<br />
model ensembles. This is possible through some equivalent of 'ls
<br />
cesm_*.nc' and 'ls ecmwf_*.nc' performed on a local directory or
<br />
the equivalent specified through a repository gateway's GUI.
<br />
Let us say she finds the four datasets, cesm_01.nc, cesm_02.nc,
<br />
ecmwf_01.nc, and ecmwf_02.nc.
<br />
<br />Point 1: How does the user know she has all the realizations?
<br />
She has 2 from CESM and 2 from ECMWF but how does she know she is not
<br />
missing cesm_03.nc and ecmwf_03.nc? How does she know how many total
<br />
realizations are supposed (by the producer/distributor) to comprise
<br />
the ensemble? What if, for whatever reason (a filename mispelling,
<br />
a quirky server problem), not all matching datasets are found?
<br />
Perhaps some &quot;ensemble&quot; metadata would help: It could standardize how
<br />
to indicate the size of the intended ensemble, and enumerate the
<br />
current realization, the equivalent of &quot;Page 2 of 5&quot;.
<br />
Then recipients know when they have all the data. I would argue that
<br />
knowing/discovering the size of an intended ensemble via metadata
<br />
is more robust than filename grepping or equivalent.
<br />
<br />Point 2: Multiple and/or Non-numeric Ensemble axes
<br />
The two hierachies constructable in this example are (top-&gt;bottom)
<br />
Model-&gt;Realization and Realization-&gt;Model. Let's call those
<br />
orientations the ensemble axes. Our researcher wishes to obtain
<br />
statistics along each axis of the ensemble, e.g., the mean temperature
<br />
of each Model (average realizations for each model), and the mean
<br />
temperature of each realization (average of realization #1 for all
<br />
models). How does the researcher know that she has all the models?
<br />
The lack of &quot;ensemble&quot; metadata means that she may have to rely, once
<br />
again, on results of &quot;ls&quot;, GUI-searches, or non-automatically-readable
<br />
documentation to be sure she has found all the models. By this I mean
<br />
that nothing in the flat-file metadata indicates that there are only
<br />
two models (not 3 or 24) along the Model axis of the ensemble. Once
<br />
again, perhaps some &quot;ensemble&quot; metadata would help: It could
<br />
standardize the indication of which known ensemble axes this
<br />
particular representation belongs to. For example, file cesm_01 is a
<br />
member of two known ensemble axes, Realization and Model. This file is
<br />
Realization 1 of 2 total CESM Realizations, and is (in some scheme)
<br />
Model 1 of 2 total Models. The data producer may not know a priori the
<br />
size of either ensemble axis. In which case &quot;ensemble&quot; metadata will
<br />
often be appended/altered a posteriori by the producer, distributor,
<br />
or both.
<br />
<br />Point 3: Weights and intentional reproducibility of MME statistics
<br />
The example I gave has two equally sized ensemble axes, 2 models of
<br />
2 Realizations each, so that MME statistics would would weight each
<br />
of the 4 total members equally (with a weight of 0.25). Consider now
<br />
the case (call it &quot;sequestration?&quot;) where the CESM model has 2
<br />
realizations and the ECMWF model grows to 3 realizations so there are
<br />
5 total members in the MME. What will the researcher call the MME
<br />
average? The researcher faces a choice. She might use a brute force
<br />
method that averages all five inputs together and weights them at 20%
<br />
apiece. That's often easier. Or she might subscribe to the notion of
<br />
weighting each model equally and therefore perform a two-step average
<br />
so that the 2 CESM realizations are weighted at 0.25 each and the 3
<br />
ECMWF realizations are weighted at 0.5/3=0.167 each. Without
<br />
&quot;ensemble&quot; metadata, the flat files do not know what size ensembles
<br />
they belong to, and it is difficult for tools to automate the correct
<br />
uneven weighting of datasets to create an MME. Unsophisticated users
<br />
may take the brute-force approach and inadvertently weight all
<br />
datasets equally. &quot;ensemble&quot; metadata could reduce the chances of this
<br />
happening, and thus ensure greater reproducibility.
<br />
<br />This example illustrates the case where dataset weights depend only
<br />
on the number of datasets in an ensemble axis, yet some datasets may
<br />
have intrinsic weights that normalize to unity along that ensemble
<br />
axis yet are not equal for each ensemble member. Such datasets could
<br />
be created by input parameters or observations that occupy a known
<br />
proportion of probability space (i.e., PDF-based not Monte Carlo-based
<br />
approach). How might these weights best be distributed with datasets
<br />
so that users compute the statistics correctly? &quot;ensemble&quot; metadata
<br />
could indicate weights (similar to an area_weight across datasets).
<br />
<br />This concludes my intended-to-be-compelling example of the utility
<br />
of &quot;ensemble&quot; metadata. Sorry if it puts you to sleep :) People can
<br />
think about the utility to CF of &quot;group-aware&quot; metadata in multiple
<br />
One way is from the data-storage-elegance point of view. Another way,
<br />
advanced here, is how researchers could exploit it. Both are valid
<br />
and possibly complementary ways of thinking about &quot;group-aware&quot; CF.
<br />
<br />Maybe this persuades you that CF could/should support &quot;ensembles&quot;.
<br />
How? As a new file-level featureType? Or in some other way?
<br />
If so then we have a use-case for a convention that could apply
<br />
to flat files, and/or be implemented in hierarchical files.
<br />
That could be a follow-on discussion.
<br />
If not, if there is no consensus use-case, then I agree there's no
<br />
point for a CF modification and let's all solve the above problems
<br />
by whichever methods we happen to like.
<br />
<br />If you're still undecided then maybe you would be persuaded by a
<br />
different use-case example. I too would like to see other use-cases.
<br />
So if you've got one, please describe it.
<br />
<br />Thanks for reading this far!
