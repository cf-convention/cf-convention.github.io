Hi Bryan,
<br />
<br />Your last point is crucial so let me address it first.
<br />
I agree that placing metadata that is &quot;external&quot; to the dataset into
<br />
the dataset is a mistake! A &quot;category error&quot; as you put it. As the
<br />
interleaved response explains, our proposal neither recommends nor
<br />
requires this.

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Great use case, but not compelling :-) Before I get going, I can see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that folks might want to do this, and fair play, but it's not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compelling. Let me give you a couple of examples of where this approach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would cause others problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's imagine that the ensemble members take time to produce, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not everything can be stored online and some stuff has to go to tape.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  So now we have a situation where we are encouraging folks to write into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; files that *will* need to be altered, and we'll have to pull all those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; files off tape to modify them. Further, we can be sure that the axes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analyses will change over time as different users analyse the data for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different problems.
</em><br />
<br />Back-end storage (e.g., your tape farm) need not change at all.
<br />
Servers can continue to store flat datasets as primary sources.
<br />
Servers could aggregate into hierarchies as user or provider desires.
<br />
Datasets matching a query (&quot;all ECMWF Historical simulations&quot;)
<br />
could be aggregated into a hierarchy by the server and returned.
<br />
No one advocates needing to know how many ensemble members will be
<br />
performed and including that number in a model dataset at run time.
<br />
It would be unwise and practically impossible to do.
<br />
Let the query retrieve what it will and aggregate the data if and how
<br />
the query specifies. Then the user/provider could obtain/serve ONE
<br />
or a few hierarchical files or possibly flat files with equivalent
<br />
metadata (subject to size limitations, of course).
<br />
<br />In fact the group aggregation CF could consider would solve many
<br />
problems without appending _any_ metadata, for groups hierarchies can
<br />
be automatically traversed and counted (thus determining ensemble axis
<br />
size), and/or extra group metadata can be added outside the &quot;ensemble&quot;
<br />
without touching the original data. A logical place for &quot;external&quot;
<br />
data for members of the CESM ensemble could be group metadata in
<br />
the supergroup (/cesm) that holds the members (/cesm/cesm_??).
<br />
Do flat files offer a cleaner method for handling &quot;external&quot; data?
<br />
And one that generalizes to ensembles of any order?
<br />
<br />As mentioned in a previous thread, some users prefer all their data in
<br />
one place. Where they can, e.g., average it with one command:
<br />
<br />ncwa mme_cnt.nc. Done. No loops or wildcards necessary.
<br />
<br />Some users will prefer their current methods. Some will shift
<br />
gradually as tools, producers, distributors, and conventions improve
<br />
support.
<br />
<br />Many objections to hierarchies understandably come from data
<br />
distributors with an investment in an existing codebase.
<br />
That's a fact---not a criticism---because who else reads this list?
<br />
Once users have their data, they don't spend so much time looking at
<br />
catalogs and web services. They massage the data they have obtained.
<br />
As files. Lots and lots of flat files. Many users, and some
<br />
distributors, would appreciate a tidier solution.
<br />
<br />We could start a whole thread on the use case of &quot;return all the data
<br />
sets relevant to this bounding box&quot;. Practically impossible with
<br />
flat files because of all the grids that could be involved. Yet quite
<br />
plausible with groups. However, this case does not interest me as much
<br />
as MME. Please be aware of the general issue of file proliferation,
<br />
though.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A priori grouping is the same as deciding a priori on the most efficient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axes of analysis. In general, for climate data analysis (and for us at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BADC with very diverse user groupings) this approach would be very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inefficient ...
</em><br />
<br />In other words, ability to aggregate, dismember, flatten, invert, and
<br />
reorder hierarchies easily without loss of information is desirable.
<br />
Fully agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want to avoid relying on ls/grep and friends, then why not have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; short line text file, a manifest? So we only need to alter the manifest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Incidentally that' the same solution that NASA should be using.)
</em><br />
<br />No argument from me that that can work well for providers.
<br />
However, many users rely on typing commands to analyze datasets on
<br />
their local machine which have been previously downloaded or produced
<br />
locally. I was thinking more of them. When information needed for an
<br />
analysis in not in the file, then the file in incomplete.
<br />
Self-describing datasets are great.
<br />
Self-describing and complete datasets are even better.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; IMHO it's a category error to push everything into internal file
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metadata. The suitcase metaphor is exactly appropriate for this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach, since the reason for doing it is to transfer stuff you think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belongs together. However, five minutes after getting home, you empty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the suitcase .... and reorganise it. At petascale, we can't afford to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that!
</em><br />
<br />Pack a suitcase when it makes sense.
<br />
Users will let you know when you've packed well by their silence.
<br />
Or poorly by their complaints :)
<br />
<br />Finally, your reponse does not indicate how/if you would solve Point 3
<br />
of my &quot;compelling ensemble&quot; example, e.g., weights. How would you
<br />
attach data that is &quot;external&quot; to a dataset to the dataset without
<br />
running into all the problems of a priori writing?
