The important factor for me is the work flow and people, not the technology. Git and github are a bit nicer to work with than svn, the merging is a bit better etc but we can support collaborative editing either way around.
<br />
<br />I will vote for github as it has a number of useful tools and the work flow is a little neater and more transparent but it's not the vital factor.  We can leave CF-Trac as is and still use either tool option.
<br />
<br />What I think is valuable is that a number of people make edits to the conventions document and a reviewer casts their eye of each change set to ensure coherence and merge this in.
<br />
<br />I think there are a number of busy people who could spare a little time to write up an approved trac ticket and a number of busy people very familiar with the CF Conventions document who could spare a little time to review a single merge request based on one ticket and merge it or return it for rework.
<br />
<br />My observation is that there is not one busy person who can spare enough time to do this for all the approved but unfinished trac tickets.
<br />
<br />It may be that having one reviewer, responsible for consistency, and multiple editors still presents a significant speed up compared to now, but I am not completely convinced that one person needs to be responsible for the whole document.
<br />
<br />Before we get to far into technology discussions, can we agree that in principle that multiple editors with a 'review then merge' process is a good idea?
<br />
Or are there reasons why multiple editors and reviewers is not preferred, accepting that this puts a large lag time on publishing?
<br />
<br />If we agree this thought process and that we can do something about it then I'll engage with whatever technology is put in front of me. Github is a slight preference in my mind, but whatever's quickest to get up and running has to be a worthwhile candidate.
<br />
<br />I assume changes and new accounts to the CF SVN system are managed at PCMDI so I don't know how easy it is for someone with administration rights to engage with this.
<br />
<br />For github we can create a new 'organization' in a few minutes and put the conventions source in as a project. I can help with this, but it doesn't need me, it's easy to do.
<br />
<br />The challenge is agreeing roles and responsibilities, this is an issue of people, not of technology, in my mind.
<br />
<br />all the best
<br />

<br />
<br />Jonathan,
<br />
<br />The good thing about the git &quot;pull request&quot; method of updating
<br />
CF-conventions would be that someone can fork the repository (make
<br />
their own copy of the document, in this case), make the edits related
<br />
to their issue, and then submit a &quot;pull request&quot; to the person with
<br />
authority to update the master document.
<br />
<br />The advantage is that the person with responsibility for the whole
<br />
does not have to make all the edits themselves -- yet they can easily
<br />
see and review how the edits look in a revised copy, and these can be
<br />
accepted or discussed further with the community.
<br />
<br />So basically best of both worlds: easier for the community to
<br />
contribute, and less work for the person with responsibility to
<br />
maintain the master.
<br />
<br />-Rich

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still need someone to take responsibility for the whole.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main reason for slow progress in CF discussions is the limitation on brain-

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However it would be interesting to know more about how different technology
