Dear Markus
<br />
<br />Thanks for your thoughtful consideration.
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;surface_particle_number_concentration_at_stp_in_aerosol (and other similar names). Could this be said more clearly as surface_number_concentration_of_aerosol_in_air_at_stp?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That would be consistent with existing names e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; number_concentration_of_coarse_mode_ambient_aerosol_in_air&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The standard names I proposed use the term &quot;aerosol&quot; according to its proper textbook definition, i.e. meaning the system of particles and carrier gas. Your wording implies that &quot;aerosol&quot; consists of particles only, which is a common, but colloquial jargon use of the term. I respect the use of &quot;aerosol&quot; in standard names so far, so I worded the proposed names to be backward compatible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with you about the textbook definition but it appears that existing CF names are not consistent. We have some names with a construction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   number_concentration_of_X_aerosol_in_air
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and some with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   atmosphere_number_content_of_aerosol_particles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The difference between concentration and content is that the first is 3D and the second a vertical integral, so that's not a problem. We could change the first construction in existing names e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number_concentration_of_ambient_aerosol_in_air to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   number_concentration_of_X_aerosol_particles_in_air
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. insert &quot;particles&quot;. Would that be correct? I suppose that in_air is needed because aerosol is not necessarily in air (although the word looks like it should be). It could be any gas. Then for consistency, could you use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   number_concentration_of_aerosol_particles_at_stp_in_air
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in your new names?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MF: Yes, that would be an option, and probably also a rather consistent and correct one! A few questions to this consensus from my side:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) I realized that I partly used the &quot;_in_air&quot; qualifier in my proposed standard names and partly not. I don't have any particular preference on using it or not. In the geophysical context, I can't think of any other carrier gas for an aerosol than air, so omitting &quot;_in_air&quot; would probably be ok. On the other hand, we may also keep it in for the sake of precision in wording. Should I consistently use &quot;in_air&quot; in my proposed names or not?
</em><br />
<br />If CF is never going to be applied to aerosols which aren't in air, then I
<br />
suppose this phrase could be omitted. I am not an expert! Is this a safe
<br />
assumption? I note that there are 42 standard names which contain both
<br />
&quot;aerosol&quot; and &quot;in_air&quot;. I suppose they ought to be modified if we decide
<br />
that this phrase is not needed. On the whole I would vote to keep it, because
<br />
more information is better.
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) In my proposed names for atmospheric aerosol optical properties, I referred only to &quot;aerosol&quot;, e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; volume_absorption_coefficient_in_air_due_to_dried_aerosol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even though the variable is supposed to refer to the absorption coefficient of the particle phase only. Should I change these names as well, e.g. to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; volume_absorption_coefficient_of_dried_aerosol_particles_at_stp_in_air ?
</em><br />
<br />I have to confess to not really understanding enough to answer this. Still,
<br />
one way to answer it may be to ask, is there any conceivably useful
<br />
distinction between these two? If not, there's probably no need to change them.
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You draw attention to the inclusion of &quot;surface&quot; in the above, but I'm not clear why it's there. Is the measurement actually exactly at the ground? If not, surface should be omitted, and the height indicated by a numerical coordinate, or some other phrase e.g. in_atmosphere_boundary_layer (that one already appears in the stdname table).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The term &quot;surface&quot; is used according to the description given in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Guidelines for Construction of CF Standard Names&quot; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; <a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/guidelines">http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/guidelines</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4-5 m above the ground is not really the surface. The constructions surface_ and _at_surface mean the same thing; they're chosen according to which seems to be easier to read in the context concerned. So I'd prefer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;                 2) Include in the definition the requirement that the sampling height needs to be included as numerical                         coordinate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's what we do with screen-height temperature, for example. Although it is often called &quot;surface air temperature&quot;, its standard name is air_temperature and it has a height coordinate (e.g. 1.5 m or 2.0 m).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MF: Ok, I see the problem. I would in any case swap the &quot;surface_&quot; qualifier with &quot;_at_surface&quot; to avoid confusion, and requiring a height coordinate makes sense anyway. I'm still not quite happy with dropping &quot;_at_surface&quot; altogether. When the standard name is used in a data discovery portal independently of a file, having this information included in the name will be a big help to the user. He will see immediately what's in the file without opening it. You say that &quot;_at_surface&quot; means the exact interface of atmosphere and ground. However, even for models, this definition will depend very much on model resolution. &quot;_at_surface&quot; for a GCM will be very different from &quot;_at_surface&quot; for a microscale boundary layer model. How's that different from my proposed use of &quot;_at_surface? Could I use &quot;_at_surface&quot; AND require stating the sampling height as vertical coordinate?
</em><br />
<br />I don't think it would be consistent with the guidelines or existing names to
<br />
do that. The intention is that named surfaces and coordinate values are
<br />
alternatives. Data discovery is a different purpose from the use metadata
<br />
provided by CF. I think this sounds a bit unobliging, doesn't it, but I can't
<br />
think of a good solution. You could presumably provide a long_name or some
<br />
other attributes to describe the quantity further.
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wonder if sizing_relative_humidity could be made more self-explanatory somehow, and also whether for the other RH you also need a new and more explicit standard name, in order to make the distinction clearer?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MF: I pondered this one for a good while. I think a separate humidity variable for indicating the humidity of a CCN concentration would add confusion. After all, this &quot;relative_humidity&quot; would be a co-ordinate variable to the CCN concentration or CCN number size distribution, so it's clear immediately what is meant. The &quot;sizing_relative_humidity&quot; would be auxiliary information. I could rename it to &quot;relative_humidity_at aerosol_particle_size_selection&quot;, which would be rather self-explaining. Would that be ok?
</em><br />
<br />I think so, yes. Maybe &quot;for&quot; instead of &quot;at&quot;? Thank you!
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
