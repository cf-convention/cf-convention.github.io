Dear Jonathan et al:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;a data point ....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;As an engineer working an operational data production system with 
<br />
schedules and deadlines, and the requirement to use NetCDF file format we 
<br />
are leveraging CF conventions wherever consensus has been reached.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The benefit of using these conventions (regardless of their provisional 
<br />
status) outweighs any risk of their retraction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;I am curious what other folks working operational data production systems 
<br />
are doing in this regard.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;very respectfully,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;randy
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;

Dear Richard
<br />
<br />That's right. No change since 1.0 has so far passed beyond being 
<br />
&quot;provisional&quot;
<br />
since we didn't definitely agree how to do that. I am not strongly in 
<br />
favour of
<br />
provisional status myself, but others have argued strongly for it 
<br />
previously.
<br />
I think there is a good argument that we should try hard to avoid making a
<br />
mistake which we have to reverse, because data lasts forever, and if data 
<br />
were
<br />
written with a flawed standard, it would forever be a nuisance. Of course 
<br />
in
<br />
principle this can be detected and perhaps worked round using the version 
<br />
from
<br />
the Conventions attribute, but in practice I suspect this attribute is not
<br />
normally written scrupulously correctly, nor inspected by analysis 
<br />
software.
<br />
So we should be careful, and that means a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period during 
<br />
which
<br />
data is at risk of being invalidated if it uses a provisional convention is 
<br />
a
<br />
reasonable safeguard, but it should not be a long period - months, not 
<br />
years,
<br />
I would say.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'd like to propose changing the rules. That's something the 
</em><br />
conventions committee can agree, I believe. I would suggest the simplest 
<br />
possibility, if we wish to retain provisional status, is to specify a time. 
<br />
We could say that, after one year from acceptance or when the next version 
<br />
of the conventions document is published, whichever is later, a change 
<br />
becomes permanent. What do you think?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The more I consider the concept of &quot;provisional status&quot; the more it 
</em><br />
concerns me. What does it actually mean for a netCDF file to use a 
<br />
particular &quot;Conventions&quot; attribute value? How can one tell what is still in 
<br />
provisional status? What version should data writers be using? I've checked 
<br />
back through 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 and they all still contain sections 
<br />
marked as provisional. Using the analogy to software versions that has been 
<br />
raised elsewhere, the CF convention versions are essentially pre-release 
<br />
versions, e.g. 1.6-beta, and are not suitable for production use.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would argue that the simplest possibility is to drop the &quot;provisional 
</em><br />
status&quot; concept. Identifying and resolving problems should happen during 
<br />
the discussion of the modification and its subsequent application to the 
<br />
conventions document.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a further flaw, ambiguity, etc. is subsequently discovered prior to 
</em><br />
the publication of the next version of the conventions then it can easily 
<br />
be resolved at that time.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a problem is discovered after the publication of the next version then 
</em><br />
a correction must be applied and published in a *new* version. That version 
<br />
could be a &quot;bug fix&quot; version (e.g. 1.6.1) or it could just wait for the 
<br />
next normal release, e.g. 1.7. It would help to agree that process in 
<br />
advance but I have no strong opinion either way.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Jeff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Present CF Conventions policies require that all changes be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; provisional, and marked as such in the document, until determined to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be permanent at a later time (this determination has never been made).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That's the meaning of all the pink and yellow highlighting in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; document at cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, this is a issue. As Richard said, it doesn't matter how it is 
</em><br />
marked. The problem is that all changes, however old, are still marked as 
<br />
provisional, as you said. This is (a) a bit silly and (b) a nuisance as 
<br />
regards legibility of the doc. The aim of provisional status was to allow 
<br />
time for people to try out the change, in case a logical flaw was 
<br />
discovered which hadn't been fore- seen at the time of the proposal. This 
<br />
was because of the concern that many or most proposals concern data which 
<br />
has not yet been written, so the metadata being proposed can't have been 
<br />
thoroughly tested. It was supposed that some tests, using specified 
<br />
software, would be used to demonstrate the new feature was &quot;working&quot;, but 
<br />
no-one had time to work out the details for this.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd like to propose changing the rules. That's something the conventions 
</em><br />
committee can agree, I believe. I would suggest the simplest possibility, 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
