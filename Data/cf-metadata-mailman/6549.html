Dear all
<br />
<br />I think I must not have missed a point somewhere. Version control is not the
<br />
same as branches, is it. We already have version control and maybe we could
<br />
add a third digit to it if we corrected defects between versions. I do not
<br />
see a need for branches in developing the convention. In software development
<br />
you need branches when different changes overlap and are being developed
<br />
concurrently. That has hardly ever been the case for the CF convention, as far
<br />
as I remember, though I think there might at the moment be a couple of trac
<br />
tickets that modify the same part of the document. This has arisen because
<br />
there are so many agreed trac tickets waiting to be actioned, and is a reason
<br />
why we need the next version (CF-1.7) to be finalised. Moreover in the end
<br />
you have to reconcile concurrent developments, and I would say that in the
<br />
case of the CF convention it would hardly make sense to develop two changes
<br />
separately and then reconcile them subsequently - it would be much more
<br />
sensible to reconcile and probably combine them as they were being discussed,
<br />
I would argue. Thus I think we are fine with the existing system that agrees
<br />
changes independently, and then combines them all to make a new version.
<br />
<br />I don't know about what software systems are best suited for it. I think that
<br />
trac is a good system for it, because it records the whole discussion and it's
<br />
easy for anyone to read and contribute to it without understanding anything
<br />
except simple text markup (and even that is inessential). But if other systems
<br />
do the same things and have other advantages, that would be fine. We are using
<br />
trac really much like email, but it's easier to keep the threads separate.
<br />
(We did use the email list for conventions changes before we used trac.)
<br />
<br />I'm still unclear about my previous question. Is it envisaged that many people
<br />
might prepare a new version of the document with a trac ticket implemented in
<br />
it, and then request to upload it? Who would do the proof-reading and give
<br />
the final OK that the change was as agreed in the ticket? It would be helpful
<br />
to know what folk at PCDMI think who manage the current system. Is this way of
<br />
doing it better than having a single editor, as we do now? The convention is
<br />
not like a large software package. It is something we all write together, in
<br />
effect, rather than something we all contribute to independently. I suppose
<br />
there must be parallels with other standards documents.
<br />
<br />The CF convention and the standard name table are versioned and managed
<br />
independently. The convention and conformance documents are synchronised.
<br />
The standard name table is synchronised with the area types table and the
<br />
standard name guidelines.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
