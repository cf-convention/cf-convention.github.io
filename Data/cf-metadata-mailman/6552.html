<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I must not have missed a point somewhere. Version control is not

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same as branches, is it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />well, we have a vocabulary issue here:
<br />
<br />Applying version numbers to something and what those version numbers mean
<br />
is one thing.
<br />
<br />On the other hand: &quot;version control&quot; is usually used to describe a software
<br />
system that helps you manage the various versions (numbered or not) of
<br />
files involved with a software system. CVS, SVN, git, Hg are all version
<br />
control systems, often also called Source code management systems (SCM),
<br />
because they were all designed to be used for software development.
<br />
<br />However, despite being designed for software development, such systems can
<br />
be very helpful for developing other sorts of documents -- particularly if
<br />
they are large-ish document with multiple parts that may be in multiple
<br />
files and multiple people want to contribute to them.
<br />
<br />So: I _think_ what is being proposed here is that the CF-2.*.* version of
<br />
the CF standards document be developed as a community effort in an SCM,
<br />
specifically git.
<br />
<br />Also (and a bit orthogonally) that the entire endeavor be managed in a
<br />
project management system, specifically gitHub. gitHub provides a hosting
<br />
service and nice front end to git, as well as an issue tracking system,
<br />
etc, for managing the project.
<br />
<br />Currently, CF is using TRAC for the project mangement -- gitHub provides
<br />
similar, though I think better for this sort of thing, functionality as
<br />
TRAC tickets.
<br />
<br />However, as far as I know, the CF document itself is not managed in a SCM
<br />
-- so that would be the real change here. TRAC can be linked to an SCM,
<br />
including SVN and git, but it's not as clean a linkage with as nice an
<br />
interface as gitHub.
<br />
<br />Another trick is that while git (or SVN, or...) can be used to mange any
<br />
kind of document -- it really works best with simple text formats -- i,e OK
<br />
with LaTeX, great with RST or MarkDown, can be done, but painful with XML.
<br />
The reason for this  is that git uses line by line comparisons and merging
<br />
of changed documents -- binary formats are useless, and XML is very easy to
<br />
break if you swap out lines.
<br />
<br />(there may  be a XML-aware diff-ing and merging tool  that one could plug
<br />
into git -- I have no idea)
<br />
<br />So there are various proposals on the table, that are semi-independent (and
<br />
if they are not on the table then I am putting them there..;-) )
<br />
<br />1) We manage the development of the CF-2.x.x document in a source code
<br />
management system, much like a software project
<br />
<br />2) We manage the project on gitHub -- using gitHub issues to discuss, and
<br />
the whole fork-pull-request thing for updating the document.
<br />
<br />3) We move discussion to gitHub issues, rather than TRAC tickets.
<br />
<br />4) We use somethign other than DocBook XML for the document - XML does not
<br />
lend itself to an SCM, and non-experts editing the doc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We already have version control and maybe we could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; add a third digit to it if we corrected defects between versions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We have versioning, not version control -- see above.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see a need for branches in developing the convention. In software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; development
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you need branches when different changes overlap and are being developed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concurrently.
</em><br />
<br />That has hardly ever been the case for the CF convention, as far
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as I remember, though I think there might at the moment be a couple of trac
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tickets that modify the same part of the document.
</em><br />
<br /><br />There may be little need for branching, yes -- but actually branching is
<br />
easy and fast with git, and you never know when what you are doing is
<br />
conflict with what someone else is doing until you merge. But anyway, git
<br />
and gitHub are pretty useful, even if you don't branch much.
<br />
<br />And we may want to use branches to keep separate documents apart (though I
<br />
don't personally think that's the way to us them...)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Moreover in the end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have to reconcile concurrent developments, and I would say that in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case of the CF convention it would hardly make sense to develop two changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separately and then reconcile them subsequently - it would be much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensible to reconcile and probably combine them as they were being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would argue.
</em><br />
<br /><br />well  the git mantra is to branch often, but also to merge often....I&quot;m not
<br />
sure the mechanism makes a lot of difference here anyway.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus I think we are fine with the existing system that agrees
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes independently, and then combines them all to make a new version.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />that's pretty much what would happen with branches (or without...)
<br />
<br />I don't know about what software systems are best suited for it. I think
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trac is a good system for it, because it records the whole discussion and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easy for anyone to read and contribute to it without understanding anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except simple text markup (and even that is inessential).
</em><br />
<br /><br />gitHub issues are very similar in this regard. One thing it does better is
<br />
link to email.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm still unclear about my previous question. Is it envisaged that many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might prepare a new version of the document with a trac ticket implemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, and then request to upload it? Who would do the proof-reading and give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the final OK that the change was as agreed in the ticket?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think the idea here is a different work flow. If the document is manged
<br />
in git, then:
<br />
<br />Discussion of an idea would happen in a git issue. When someone (anyone)
<br />
had a proposal for changing the text of the document, they would clone the
<br />
repo, make the change in their copy, and issue a pull request. Then anyone
<br />
could comment on that change via the pull request system. Whoever (I
<br />
presume a small group of people) had the authority to make the final
<br />
decision would merge (Or not) the change when they thought it was ready.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be helpful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to know what folk at PCDMI think who manage the current system.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing it better than having a single editor, as we do now? The convention
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not like a large software package. It is something we all write together,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect, rather than something we all contribute to independently.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think a software package is very much something we write together. And
<br />
this sort of system/workflow is a good way to do that. I would be
<br />
interested in what eh folks currently managing the document think ,but I
<br />
think a system without a bottle neck at one small group of people would be
<br />
much better -- particular in the early stages as things change fast.
<br />
<br />I've been involved with a wide variety of approaches to creating and
<br />
managing a document that a lot of people contribute to -- and they all
<br />
really suck compared to a software version control system.
<br />
<br />Does this make it any more clear?
