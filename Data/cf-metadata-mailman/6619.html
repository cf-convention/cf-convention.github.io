Hi John
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think '?' is not a definition that is helpful to most users -- it is
</em><br />
more like an indication that the string -- the empty string in this case
<br />
for example -- has not provided a meaningful indication of what the units
<br />
are.
<br />
<br />I share the same impression.   I was thinking it would be nicer for
<br />
maintener of udunits.  We should ask modifying udunits so that it would
<br />
refuse processing &quot;no_units&quot; otherwise ut_multiply(&quot;no_units&quot;, &quot;no_units&quot;)
<br />
returns &quot;no_units 2&quot;.   If I remember right the unit string &quot;?&quot; causes
<br />
immediate error, so we don't have to change udunits.
<br />
<br />But I'm okay if the majority here agrees that sort of thing is not a
<br />
responsibility of udunits.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
Eizi

&gt; Thanks for summing this up so neatly Mark!

&gt; We could take the view that the conventions would benefit from the
&gt; addition of some text into 3.1 to explicitly make the point about
&gt; quantities which are not dimensioned or dimensionless.
&gt; We could alternatively defer to udunits as most unit questions do, which
&gt; already exhibits this behaviour, and just patch the 'area_type' and any
&gt; similar names with erroneous canonical units.
&gt; We could also request that udunits be updated with a clearer string for
&gt; this case, given the need for it, such as including the term 'no_units' as
&gt; a valid udunits term to mean there are no units here: this is not
&gt; dimensionless, this is not dimensioned.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Why is the first option exclusive to the others? Seems useful to improve
&gt; the documentation regardless.
&gt;
&gt; So I agree that '1' makes no sense for area_type. I'm wondering if someone
&gt; can crisply describe what is meant when we (or UDUNITS) say a unit is
&gt; dimensionless? I'm not entirely sure I get it.
&gt;
&gt; In any case, I think '?' is not a definition that is helpful to most users
&gt; -- it is more like an indication that the string -- the empty string in
&gt; this case for example -- has not provided a meaningful indication of what
&gt; the units are.
&gt;
&gt; So my ideal solution has CF well aligned with UDUNITS, and a clear concept
&gt; and definition. Which I think suggests asking UDUNITS for a term
&gt; 'no_units', defined as &quot;the values do not have units; values are neither
&gt; dimensioned nor dimensionless.&quot;

&gt;
&gt; This is the same behaviour as I was looking to adopt, but CF 3.1 makes
&gt; this incorrect, I believe, as a lack of a units attribute is to be
&gt; interpreted as a units of '1'.
&gt;
&gt; I think a clear way to define that a quantity is not dimensioned and is
&gt; not dimensionless is required.  I would have liked to use the lack of a
&gt; unit for this purpose, but this has already been taken, so something else
&gt; is needed.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; My preference is that one explicitly puts in the units. For
&gt; dimensionless, &quot;1&quot; or &quot;&quot; is ok for udunits.
&gt;
&gt; udunits2 treats '1' and '' differently.
&gt;
&gt;   a unit of '1' has a definition of '1'
&gt;   a unit of '' has a definition of '?'
&gt;
&gt; The CF conventions description of units (3.1) states that an absence of a
&gt; units attribute is deemed to be equivalent to dimensionless, a unit of
&gt; '1'.  This is the convention, and it has been in force a long time.
&gt;
&gt; However CF makes no statement that I can find regarding a unit of ''.
&gt; Thus I believe we defer back to udunits, which CF states is how units are
&gt; defined.  Udunits states that a unit of '' is undefined, the quantity is
&gt; not dimensioned and is not dimensionless.  We could adopt this to use for
&gt; the cases in question.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; area_type is given in the standard_name table as having a unit of 1. It
&gt; is a categorical string-valued quantity.
&gt;
&gt; On the basis of the discussion, I would suggest that this is an error.  If
&gt; area_type is a categorical string-valued quantity, it is not dimensionless,
&gt; it is not continuous and numerical, it is not a pure number and should not
&gt; be treated as such.  I think we should fix this.
&gt;

&gt; I don't mind which route is preferred, I'm happy to put a change together
&gt; and pursue it; whichever way seems better to people.

&gt;
&gt; CF says that if the units attribute is missing, then the quantity has no
&gt; units.
&gt;
&gt; The Conventions document, section 3.1 says:
&gt;
&gt; The units attribute is required for all variables that represent
&gt; dimensional quantities (except for boundary variables defined in Section 7.1,
&gt; ?Cell Boundaries?
&gt; &lt;<a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#cell-boundaries">http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#cell-boundaries</a>&gt;and
&gt; climatology variables defined in Section 7.4, ?Climatological Statistics?
&gt; &lt;<a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#climatological-statistics">http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#climatological-statistics</a>&gt;
&gt; ).
&gt;
&gt; and
&gt;
&gt; Units are not required for dimensionless quantities. A variable with no
&gt; units attribute is assumed to be dimensionless. However, a units attribute
&gt; specifying a dimensionless unit may optionally be included. The Udunits
&gt; package defines a few dimensionless units, such as percent , but is
&gt; lacking commonly used units such as ppm (parts per million). This
&gt; convention does not support the addition of new dimensionless units that
&gt; are not udunits compatible. The conforming unit for quantities that
&gt; represent fractions, or parts of a whole, is &quot;1&quot;. The conforming unit for
&gt; parts per million is &quot;1e-6&quot;. Descriptive information about dimensionless
&gt; quantities, such as sea-ice concentration, cloud fraction, probability,
&gt; etc., should be given in the long_name or standard_name attributes (see
&gt; below) rather than the units.
&gt;
&gt; The unit of '1' is generally used to indicate fractions and the like. In
&gt; cases where I am storing a raw binary value, I leave off the units
&gt; attribute, as the 'number' isn't something that should be treated as a
&gt; decimal quantity.
&gt;
&gt; Grace and peace,

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, there are some standard names which imply string values, as Karl
&gt;&gt; says. If the standard_name table says 1, that means the quantity is
&gt;&gt; dimensionless, so it's also fine to omit the units, as Jim says.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would like to raise question about this statement.  Omitting the units
&gt;&gt; and stating that the units are '1' are two very different things;
&gt;&gt;     dimensionless != no_unit
&gt;&gt; is an important statement which should be clear to data consumers and
&gt;&gt; producers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If the standard name table defines a canonical unit for a standard_name
&gt;&gt; of '1' then I expect this quantity to be dimensionless, with a unit of '1'
&gt;&gt; or some multiple there of.
&gt;&gt; If the standard name states that the canonical unit for a standard_name
&gt;&gt; is '' then I expect that quantity to have no unit stated.
&gt;&gt; Any deviation from this behaviour is a break with the conventions.  I
&gt;&gt; have code which explicitly checks this for data sets.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are people aware of examples of the pattern of use described by Jonathan,
&gt;&gt; such as a categorical quantities identified by a standard_name with a
&gt;&gt; canonical unit of '1'?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; thank you
