Dear Brigitte, Markus and Martin,
<br />
<br />Thank you all for your replies - we seem to have reached agreement on many of the outstanding points. I have accepted some more names (see below), items 5 and 6 just need to be checked quickly, please, and that will leave just the two resistance names in item 7 that still need a little more discussion.
<br />
<br />2. Agreed.
<br />
<br />The names
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_sulfate_dry_aerosol_particles_due_to_aqueous_phase_net_chemical_production (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_sulfate_dry_aerosol_particles_due_to_gaseous_phase_net_chemical_production (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
are accepted for publication in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />3. Agreed.
<br />
<br />Thank you to Markus for the clear explanation regarding dry/ambient for these names.
<br />
<br />number_concentration_of_pm10_aerosol_particles_in_air (m-3)
<br />
<br />&quot; &quot;Number concentration&quot; means the number of particles or other specified objects per unit volume. &quot;Pm10 aerosol&quot; is an air pollutant with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometers. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which the particle size applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with the standard names of, respectively, &quot;relative_humidity&quot; and &quot;air_temperature&quot;. &quot;
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for publication in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />number_concentration_of_pm2p5_aerosol_particles_in_air (m-3)
<br />
<br />&quot; &quot;Number concentration&quot; means the number of particles or other specified objects per unit volume. &quot;Pm2p5 aerosol&quot; is an air pollutant with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which the particle size applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with the standard names of, respectively, &quot;relative_humidity&quot; and &quot;air_temperature&quot;. &quot;
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for publication in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />4. Agreed.
<br />
<br />I hadn't spotted that &quot;pm&quot; was also repeating the &quot;particulate&quot; a third time! At least we're not leaving any room for doubt!
<br />
<br />The names
<br />
mass_fraction_of_pm2p5_primary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
mass_fraction_of_pm2p5_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol_particles_expressed_as_carbon_in_air
<br />
mass_fraction_of_pm2p5_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
mass_fraction_of_pm10_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
mass_fraction_of_pm10_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol_particles_expressed_as_carbon_in_air
<br />
mass_fraction_of_pm10_primary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
are accepted for publication in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />I just noticed that all the mass_fraction names had been loaded into the editor with canonical units of kg kg-1 because this is how they were expressed in Brigitte's original proposal. However, they will appear in the standard name table simply as &quot;1&quot;, i.e. dimensionless, as is the practice with all existing mass_fraction names. I hope this is OK.
<br />
<br />5. Thank you for explaining! I had not understood that &quot;bidirectional surface exchange&quot; is a term used to describe a specific set of processes, rather than an umbrella term for all surface exchanges. I had a look at the reference you provided and noticed that the introduction contains the following: &quot;Although bi-directional air-surface exchange (dry deposition and emission) of NH3 has been frequently observed over a variety of land surfaces, the majority of the air-quality models treat the air-surface exchange of NH3 as dry deposition only.&quot; I have added a bit to the definition to include this.
<br />
<br />surface_net_downward_mass_flux_of_ammonia_due_to_bidirectional_surface_exchange
<br />
<br />&quot; &quot;Downward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). Net downward mass flux is the difference between downward_mass_flux and upward_mass_flux. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Bidirectional surface exchange&quot; is the exchange of a chemical species between the atmosphere and biosphere as simulated by bidirectional surface flux models. It refers to exchange through stomata and soil surfaces and is the net result of emission and dry deposition. The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The chemical formula for ammonia is NH3.&quot;
<br />
<br />Is this OK?
<br />
<br />6. Thank you for the additional explanation.
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_artificial_tracer_with_fixed_lifetime_in_air (1)
<br />
<br />The name looks fine. Based on existing definitions and your explanation, I have constructed the following definition.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mole fraction is used in the construction &quot;mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. &quot;Artificial tracer&quot; means a passive atmospheric tracer that is used to study atmospheric transport and deposition. To specify the length of the tracer lifetime in the atmosphere, a scalar coordinate variable with the standard name of tracer_lifetime should be used.&quot;
<br />
<br />The  new standard name
<br />
<br />tracer_lifetime (s)
<br />
<br />will also be added to the standard name table.
<br />
<br />&quot;The quantity with standard name tracer_lifetime is the total length of time a passive tracer exists within a medium. Passive tracers are used in models to study processes such as transport and deposition.&quot;
<br />
<br />Is this OK?
<br />
<br />7. Resistance names. Thank you to Martin for supplying additional information and a reference regarding these names. Unfortunately I haven't yet managed to obtain a full copy of the paper, but it sounds as though we should keep the word &quot;resistance&quot; in the names.
<br />
<br />On 24/11/14 Martin Schultz wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Concerning the &quot;resistance&quot; terminology: This refers to a resistance model approach for which a paper by Wesely, 1989 (Atmos. Env., 23/6) is widely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referred to. This paper talks about &quot;surface resistances&quot; and explicitly mentions &quot;aerodynamic resistance&quot;, &quot;quasilaminar sublayer resistance&quot;, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;bulk surface resistance&quot;, the latter being composed of various terms, among them a term for &quot;stomatal resistance&quot;. Explicit reference is made to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ohm's law as analogy, and this concept is widely known in the community. I would hence argue in favour of keeping the word resistance in these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms.
</em><br />
<br />aerodynamic_resistance (m-1 s)
<br />
&quot;The &quot;aerodynamic_resistance&quot; is the resistance to mixing  through the boundary layer toward the surface by means of the dominant process, turbulent transport. Reference: Wesely, M. L., 1989,  doi:10.1016/0004-6981(89)90153-4.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Do we need to add anything further to the definition? I am wondering if the name could be made more self explanatory by making it aerodynamic_resistance_to_turbulent_deposition. This is then more similar to the canopy resistance name and makes clear what is being resisted!
<br />
<br />canopy_resistance_to_ozone_dry_deposition (m-1 s)
<br />
&quot; The &quot;canopy_resistance&quot; is the resistance of a compound to uptake by the vegetation canopy. It varies both with the surface and the chemical species or physical state (gas or particle).&quot; 
<br />
<br />Is canopy_resistance due only to stomatal resistance or are there other components? Is there another reference where canopy_resistance is defined as a term?
<br />
<br />These names are still under discussion.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
