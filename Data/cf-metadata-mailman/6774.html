Dear all
<br />
<br />Stephen Griffies and I propose some new standard_names, detailed below, for
<br />
ocean models participating in CMIP6. These are quantities which have been
<br />
included in the list of diagnostics proposed by the CLIVAR Ocean Model
<br />
Development Panel. The names are in the following groups:
<br />
<br />miscellaneous - there are four of these
<br />
X_at_sea_floor, where X is temperature or salinity. There are two varieties
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of temperature, potential or conservative
<br />
integral_wrt_depth_of_product_of_sea_water_density_and_X
<br />
ocean_C_overturning_mass_streamfunction_due_to_P, where C is a vector
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;component and P is a model process
<br />
northward_ocean_heat_transport_due_to_P
<br />
tendency_of_sea_water_X_expressed_as_X'[_due_to_P], where X is temperature
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and X' heat content, or X is salinity and X' salt content.
<br />
<br />The proposed names are given below with units, short name of use for CMIP, and
<br />
a short description. The proposed CMIP short name is just for information -
<br />
this is not part of the CF standard. We have tried to make use of existing
<br />
patterns of CF names or extend them in natural ways. Comments welcome. Thanks.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
