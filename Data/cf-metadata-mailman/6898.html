<br />
Jonathan,
<br />
<br />I see where you are coming from, and there's validity in that line of 
<br />
thought. Leap seconds represent a finer-grained adjustment to the 
<br />
overall date/time system being used. I still think it makes good sense 
<br />
to add a new attribute to declare whether or not leap second handling 
<br />
was used or strengthen our standards for time variables so that problems 
<br />
are averted.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From a human understandability perspective, a calendar attribute of 
<br />
&quot;GPS&quot; or &quot;UTC&quot; will be somewhat confusing. In my experience, people 
<br />
don't speak of the UTC calendar, it's UTC time. Further, TAI and GPS 
<br />
time don't really concern themselves with anything but counts of seconds 
<br />
since an epoch date &amp; time. People convert the counts to time stamps for 
<br />
convenience, but they are actually more equivalent to the Julian Day 
<br />
Number (JDN) than they are to the Gregorian or Julian calendar. TAI and 
<br />
GPS time have different epochs, and TAI is more accurate, but they both 
<br />
are running counts of seconds that aren't tied to the motions of the 
<br />
Earth. As a result, I think that it's improper to talk about a GPS 
<br />
calendar or TAI calendar.
<br />
<br />What is being exposed by this discussion is the reality that any of us 
<br />
(myself included) have often ignored or been unaware of the fact that 
<br />
the time calculators (time handling software) we used when filling our 
<br />
time variables with elapsed times weren't giving us true counts of 
<br />
seconds since the epochs we wrote into our units attributes. If you are 
<br />
working at a resolution of days or hours, this will probably never cause 
<br />
a problem. If you are working at a resolution of minutes or less and 
<br />
working over a time span of greater than two years, it may well have 
<br />
caused at least occasional small problems. If you are working with 
<br />
full-resolution polar-orbiting satellite data, one second represents ~7 
<br />
km of satellite motion, so such errors can produce significant 
<br />
geolocation errors.
<br />
<br />A set of elapsed seconds since a Gregorian/UTC epoch that were 
<br />
calculated from Gregorian/UTC time stamps without regard for leap 
<br />
seconds and which crossed a leap second boundary are not &quot;GPS&quot; seconds. 
<br />
Nor are they &quot;UTC&quot; seconds. They are, strictly speaking, elapsed times 
<br />
into which one or more step errors have been introduced. As I mentioned 
<br />
in a previous email, as long as you use the same time calculator to 
<br />
extract time stamps as you did to get elapsed times from input time 
<br />
stamps, you won't notice anything. You may notice a problem if you are 
<br />
taking differences between elapsed times and a leap second boundary gets 
<br />
involved.
<br />
<br />As I've considered all of this more, I'm tending to favor the second 
<br />
option I suggested.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also be more strict, and say the epoch time stamp in the units
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute must always be in UTC. The question would then be reduced to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether or not leap seconds were counted into the elapsed times stored
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the time variable. In this case, we could add a &quot;leap_seconds&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute which would have a value of &quot;UTC&quot; if UTC leap seconds were
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counted into the elapsed times, and &quot;none&quot; if not. This would also allow
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for some other system of leap seconds to be used. (I don't know if there
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are others.) For backward compatibility, considering history, the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default value for this attribute would probably be &quot;UTC&quot;.
<br />
<br />Clearly, having epoch time stamps with time zone offsets from UTC, as 
<br />
described in the CF conventions, would be OK as well. I'm also open to 
<br />
other namings for the new attribute and for its possible values. The 
<br />
leap seconds only become an issue in certain rather specific instances, 
<br />
so I think that such an attribute, along with a bit of discussion in the 
<br />
document, would likely be sufficient to warn those people that may find 
<br />
themselves negatively affected by improper leap second handling.
<br />
<br />Grace and peace,
<br />
<br />Jim

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't think calendars are the right place to encode this. We could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; add a new &quot;time_system&quot; attribute where you would declare whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your time stamps and elapsed times were based on UTC, GPS, TAI, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If we take this route, we should require the elapsed times to encode
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; leap seconds if the time system is UTC, and state that the default
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time system is UTC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this is a calendar issue because the calendar is the set of rules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which translate between components of time (YMDhms) and elapsed time (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fixed time units) since the reference time. Your later email seems to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be consistent with that. In the real world, the elapsed interval (expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; e.g. as the number of seconds) between the ref YMDhms and the actual YMDhs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depends on whether your calendar includes leap seconds (UTC) or not (GPS).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems that GPS is the calendar likely to have been assumed in existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CF datasets, so it would be logical to say that the default is the real-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world calendar without leap seconds. Have I misunderstood something? If we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regard this as a property of the calendar, we don't need a new attribute.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best wishes
