Jonathan,
<br />
<br />As I've mentioned in other emails, I don't think TAI and GPS are 
<br />
calendars, but I understand where you are coming from.
<br />
<br />When you are working in the model domain you are generating your own 
<br />
timestamps, so you are self-consistent and have no problems. As far as 
<br />
that goes, there are models that use no_leap or all_leap calendars, and 
<br />
they are again self-consistent and have no problems. In the &quot;real&quot; 
<br />
world, we often start with UTC timestamps that have leap seconds 
<br />
accounted for, yet convert them to elapsed times using calculators that 
<br />
don't account for leap seconds. This can actually lead to elapsed time 
<br />
values that encode a time discontinuity and cannot be counted on to 
<br />
produce accurate differences between every pair of values. I'm not sure 
<br />
what we should call that, but I don't like the idea of naming it with a 
<br />
calendar.
<br />
<br />It is true that a large majority of files &quot;in the wild&quot; probably either 
<br />
use time at a resolution that is coarse enough that none of this matters 
<br />
or managed to avoid having any leap seconds creep in to their elapsed 
<br />
time values.
<br />
<br />I'm not suggesting that we add anything to the units attribute. I am 
<br />
suggesting that we need to do two things. One is to more precisely 
<br />
define what sorts of times can be used in the time reference part of the 
<br />
units attribute. I just reread section 4.4, and it actually says that 
<br />
the time is UTC or a time zone offset from it. I think it should stay 
<br />
that way and the wording strengthened to make it clearer. Since there 
<br />
are no leap seconds defined before the TAI epoch date, I think there 
<br />
would be no problem with saying that times in years before Jan 1, 1958 
<br />
are assumed to have no leap seconds. (Call it proleptic UTC if you like.)
<br />
<br />The other thing I think we need to do is provide a way to indicate that 
<br />
the elapsed times in a time variable are true elapsed times that are 
<br />
certain to be free of leap second discontinuities, or are possibly 
<br />
contaminated with leap second discontinuities. In connection with this 
<br />
we would need to add clarifying language in the CF conventions to 
<br />
educate people on the importance of using time calculators that are 
<br />
aware of leap seconds when moving between UTC timestamps and elapsed 
<br />
time values. This could be handled by adding a modifier to a calendar 
<br />
name in the calendar attribute, or it could be handled by adding a new 
<br />
attribute to hold this information. I think that coming up with one or 
<br />
more new calendar names is a more confusing and less useful way to 
<br />
accomplish this.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that the historical default for existing datasets is that 
<br />
the leap second handling has to be &quot;unknown&quot;. For most (maybe all) of 
<br />
the model datasets, the actual situation is &quot;no leap second 
<br />
discontinuities&quot;. (Do you actually have any models where time in the 
<br />
output has a resolution fine enough and span wide enough for it to 
<br />
matter anyway?) For many &quot;real world&quot; datasets, the actual situation is 
<br />
&quot;possibly contaminated with leap second discontinuities&quot;, since the 
<br />
times started as UTC timestamps and were converted to elapsed times 
<br />
using calculators that didn't consider leap seconds. (But as I 
<br />
mentioned, most of them probably aren't affected by the error.) We have 
<br />
two communities that have different defaults, so we shouldn't pick one 
<br />
over the other.
<br />
<br />Grace and peace,
<br />
<br />Jim

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Jim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that TAI and GPS aren't distinct CF calendars if they differ only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of the epoch. In CF and udunits, the reference time is part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the units, as you know; it's not a property of the calendar. I referred to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; GPS calendar just to contrast it with UTC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unlike you, I don't live only in the real world. :-) Many models use the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; default CF calendar (called standard or gregorian) as an approximation to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real world. In these models there are no leap seconds, and it would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be correct to call this UTC, or to include the leap seconds in the encoding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and decoding of time cooordinates. In any case, as we understand, most software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't allow for leap seconds. For those two reasons, I propose that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more precisely define the default (standard, gregorian) calendar to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explicitly that it does not include leap seconds i.e. every day is 86400 s
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long exactly. This is probably correct for most of the data which has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written with this calendar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I call UTC a calendar because it affects the encoding, since it implies leap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds.  You suggest, I think, that the treatment of leap seconds should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indicated in the reference time in the units string. This doesn't seem quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right to me because the units doesn't say anything about the encoding. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use the same format of units string for all calendars. udunits does mention
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UTC in respect of the format of this string because of wanting to talk about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time zones, not because of leap seconds. Time zones could be used in models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too (though I don't know of a case). Hence I still propose that we should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regard UTC as a calendar, if it's correct that the leap seconds in use in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real world are part of the definition of UTC. This means we should define a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a new calendar, which is not the default, in which time units have just the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same format as usual i.e. udunits, but the encoding and decoding of values
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is done including leap seconds according to UTC. The same value, with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same units string, may translate into a different date-time (by a number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds) according to whether the calendar is default (standard, gregorian)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or utc. It wouldn't make sense to use this calendar for dates before the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduction of UTC, so it should be illegal to do so. We could do this by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prohibiting reference times earlier than the start of UTC and negative values
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time in this calendar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe I haven't grasped your point properly?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jonathan,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see where you are coming from, and there's validity in that line
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of thought. Leap seconds represent a finer-grained adjustment to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overall date/time system being used. I still think it makes good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense to add a new attribute to declare whether or not leap second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; handling was used or strengthen our standards for time variables so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that problems are averted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From a human understandability perspective, a calendar attribute of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;GPS&quot; or &quot;UTC&quot; will be somewhat confusing. In my experience, people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't speak of the UTC calendar, it's UTC time. Further, TAI and GPS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time don't really concern themselves with anything but counts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds since an epoch date &amp; time. People convert the counts to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time stamps for convenience, but they are actually more equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the Julian Day Number (JDN) than they are to the Gregorian or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Julian calendar. TAI and GPS time have different epochs, and TAI is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more accurate, but they both are running counts of seconds that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aren't tied to the motions of the Earth. As a result, I think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's improper to talk about a GPS calendar or TAI calendar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is being exposed by this discussion is the reality that any of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us (myself included) have often ignored or been unaware of the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the time calculators (time handling software) we used when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; filling our time variables with elapsed times weren't giving us true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counts of seconds since the epochs we wrote into our units
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes. If you are working at a resolution of days or hours,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this will probably never cause a problem. If you are working at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolution of minutes or less and working over a time span of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greater than two years, it may well have caused at least occasional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; small problems. If you are working with full-resolution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; polar-orbiting satellite data, one second represents ~7 km of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satellite motion, so such errors can produce significant geolocation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; errors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A set of elapsed seconds since a Gregorian/UTC epoch that were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculated from Gregorian/UTC time stamps without regard for leap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds and which crossed a leap second boundary are not &quot;GPS&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds. Nor are they &quot;UTC&quot; seconds. They are, strictly speaking,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elapsed times into which one or more step errors have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduced. As I mentioned in a previous email, as long as you use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same time calculator to extract time stamps as you did to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elapsed times from input time stamps, you won't notice anything. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may notice a problem if you are taking differences between elapsed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times and a leap second boundary gets involved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I've considered all of this more, I'm tending to favor the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; option I suggested.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     We could also be more strict, and say the epoch time stamp in the units
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     attribute must always be in UTC. The question would then be reduced to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     whether or not leap seconds were counted into the elapsed times stored
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     in the time variable. In this case, we could add a &quot;leap_seconds&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     attribute which would have a value of &quot;UTC&quot; if UTC leap seconds were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     counted into the elapsed times, and &quot;none&quot; if not. This would also allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     for some other system of leap seconds to be used. (I don't know if there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     are others.) For backward compatibility, considering history, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     default value for this attribute would probably be &quot;UTC&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clearly, having epoch time stamps with time zone offsets from UTC,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as described in the CF conventions, would be OK as well. I'm also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; open to other namings for the new attribute and for its possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; values. The leap seconds only become an issue in certain rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific instances, so I think that such an attribute, along with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit of discussion in the document, would likely be sufficient to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; warn those people that may find themselves negatively affected by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improper leap second handling.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think calendars are the right place to encode this. We could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; add a new &quot;time_system&quot; attribute where you would declare whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; your time stamps and elapsed times were based on UTC, GPS, TAI, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If we take this route, we should require the elapsed times to encode
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; leap seconds if the time system is UTC, and state that the default
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; time system is UTC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think this is a calendar issue because the calendar is the set of rules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which translate between components of time (YMDhms) and elapsed time (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fixed time units) since the reference time. Your later email seems to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to be consistent with that. In the real world, the elapsed interval (expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; e.g. as the number of seconds) between the ref YMDhms and the actual YMDhs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; depends on whether your calendar includes leap seconds (UTC) or not (GPS).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems that GPS is the calendar likely to have been assumed in existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; CF datasets, so it would be logical to say that the default is the real-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world calendar without leap seconds. Have I misunderstood something? If we

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; regard this as a property of the calendar, we don't need a new attribute.
