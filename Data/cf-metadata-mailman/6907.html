Dear Jim, Chris et al.
<br />
<br />I'm using the word &quot;calendar&quot; in a CF-consistent way, I believe. Maybe it's not
<br />
the best word for the concept, but nonetheless we have an attribute called
<br />
&quot;calendar&quot;, and its sole function is indicate which algorithm is used to
<br />
translate between components of time (YMDhms) and elapsed time (in units of
<br />
time since a reference time). So perhaps that is consistent with &quot;calendar&quot;
<br />
being a collection of algorithms, in Chris's text, but it's more specific
<br />
than that. It has a particular function in the interpretation of CF time
<br />
values (usually coordinates). CF sect 4.4.1 says
<br />
&quot;In order to calculate a new date and time given a base date, base time and a
<br />
time increment one must know what calendar to use.&quot;
<br />
and I think that is the sense in which I am using &quot;calendar&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the &quot;real&quot; world, we often start with UTC timestamps that have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leap seconds accounted for, yet convert them to elapsed times using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculators that don't account for leap seconds. This can actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lead to elapsed time values that encode a time discontinuity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be counted on to produce accurate differences between every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pair of values.
</em><br />
<br />This is a problem, I agree. We should avoid that problem for future data by
<br />
making the conventions more precise about which calculator should be used
<br />
(which calendar, in the CF sense). We can't decide for sure what was done when
<br />
encoding past data, but the conventions string records the version of CF used.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm suggesting that we need to do two things. One is to more precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define what sorts of times can be used in the time reference part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the units attribute. I just reread section 4.4, and it actually says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the time is UTC or a time zone offset from it. I think it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should stay that way and the wording strengthened to make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearer.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it does say that. It's a quote from the udunits man page. However I don't
<br />
think the issue of leap seconds has been carefully considered before, so we
<br />
don't have to assume that's what it meant exactly, especially as udunits does
<br />
not support lead seconds. As previously said, and I think you may agree, it is
<br />
likely that nearly all existing time values have been encoded *without* leap
<br />
seconds, and therefore *not* UTC strictly. Therefore my alternative suggestion
<br />
is that we should add some text here that says we don't necessarily imply
<br />
leap seconds are included by mentioning UTC. This must be the case, because
<br />
the same format of time unit is used for calendars that definitely do not ever
<br />
include leap seconds i.e. all the non-real-world ones. UTC is mentioned simply
<br />
as a way to refer to the time-zone which contains the Greenwich meridian,
<br />
without summer time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other thing I think we need to do is provide a way to indicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the elapsed times in a time variable are true elapsed times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are certain to be free of leap second discontinuities, or are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibly contaminated with leap second discontinuities. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connection with this we would need to add clarifying language in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CF conventions to educate people on the importance of using time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculators that are aware of leap seconds when moving between UTC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; timestamps and elapsed time values. This could be handled by adding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a modifier to a calendar name in the calendar attribute, or it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be handled by adding a new attribute to hold this information. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that coming up with one or more new calendar names is a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confusing and less useful way to accomplish this.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think we should define a new attribute, because this distinction is
<br />
one which applies only to the real-world calendar. It's therefore more robust
<br />
and simpler to indicate it as a modifier to the name when applicable in the
<br />
the calendar att, so making a new calendar name, in effect. But given this
<br />
discussion I agree that calling it just &quot;UTC&quot; may not be clear enough. The
<br />
real-world calendar is called &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;gregorian&quot;. I would propose a new
<br />
possibility &quot;proleptic_gregorian_utc&quot;, meaning the proleptic Gregorian
<br />
calendar with leap seconds inserted as applicable since 1958.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
