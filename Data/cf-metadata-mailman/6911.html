Jonathan,
<br />
<br />I think we are getting closer to each other, bit by bit (yay!).
<br />
<br />My responses are interspersed below.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm using the word &quot;calendar&quot; in a CF-consistent way, I believe. Maybe it's not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the best word for the concept, but nonetheless we have an attribute called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;calendar&quot;, and its sole function is indicate which algorithm is used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; translate between components of time (YMDhms) and elapsed time (in units of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time since a reference time). So perhaps that is consistent with &quot;calendar&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being a collection of algorithms, in Chris's text, but it's more specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than that. It has a particular function in the interpretation of CF time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; values (usually coordinates). CF sect 4.4.1 says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;In order to calculate a new date and time given a base date, base time and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time increment one must know what calendar to use.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I think that is the sense in which I am using &quot;calendar&quot;.
</em><br />
I agree that this is a CF-consistent usage of the word calendar, but it 
<br />
runs against natural usage, and I think it's worth keeping that in mind.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In the &quot;real&quot; world, we often start with UTC timestamps that have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; leap seconds accounted for, yet convert them to elapsed times using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; calculators that don't account for leap seconds. This can actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lead to elapsed time values that encode a time discontinuity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cannot be counted on to produce accurate differences between every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pair of values.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a problem, I agree. We should avoid that problem for future data by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making the conventions more precise about which calculator should be used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which calendar, in the CF sense). We can't decide for sure what was done when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encoding past data, but the conventions string records the version of CF used.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendars and calculators are different things. A calendar or time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system is (per Chris) a collection of algorithms. I started using
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the term calculator because it was shorter and more generic than
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;time handling module or library&quot;. A calculator is a particular
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation of a set of algorithms. This is why I ended up
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avoiding the use of the word clock as a name for the group of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithms that make up a time system. A clock is a device that is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an implementation of a set of algorithms.
<br />
<br /><br />I agree that we should make the documentation more precise, and warn 
<br />
people of the potential pitfalls of using a calculator that doesn't 
<br />
recognize leap seconds to create time variables from timestamps that 
<br />
include leap seconds (like UTC-based timestamps).
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm suggesting that we need to do two things. One is to more precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; define what sorts of times can be used in the time reference part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the units attribute. I just reread section 4.4, and it actually says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the time is UTC or a time zone offset from it. I think it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should stay that way and the wording strengthened to make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; clearer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, it does say that. It's a quote from the udunits man page. However I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think the issue of leap seconds has been carefully considered before, so we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have to assume that's what it meant exactly, especially as udunits does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not support lead seconds. As previously said, and I think you may agree, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely that nearly all existing time values have been encoded *without* leap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds, and therefore *not* UTC strictly. Therefore my alternative suggestion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that we should add some text here that says we don't necessarily imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leap seconds are included by mentioning UTC. This must be the case, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same format of time unit is used for calendars that definitely do not ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include leap seconds i.e. all the non-real-world ones. UTC is mentioned simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a way to refer to the time-zone which contains the Greenwich meridian,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without summer time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that leap seconds haven't been carefully considered before. I 
<br />
disagree that nearly all existing time values have been encoded without 
<br />
leap seconds. I'd say that nearly all existing time values that were 
<br />
derived from true UTC timestamps are at risk of having leap second 
<br />
discontinuities encoded into the set of values. (See my previous 
<br />
response below.)
<br />
<br />There are three issues here, so let's not conflate them. They are:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;1. What to call the time system that is like UTC in overall form
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Greenwich meridian, etc) but doesn't include leap seconds.
<br />
&nbsp;2. How to indicate which actual time system is being used for the time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part of the reference time in the units attribute.
<br />
&nbsp;3. How to indicate whether or not the elapsed times in the time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variable are certain to be free of leap second induced discontinuities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The other thing I think we need to do is provide a way to indicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the elapsed times in a time variable are true elapsed times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that are certain to be free of leap second discontinuities, or are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possibly contaminated with leap second discontinuities. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; connection with this we would need to add clarifying language in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; CF conventions to educate people on the importance of using time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; calculators that are aware of leap seconds when moving between UTC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; timestamps and elapsed time values. This could be handled by adding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a modifier to a calendar name in the calendar attribute, or it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be handled by adding a new attribute to hold this information. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think that coming up with one or more new calendar names is a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; confusing and less useful way to accomplish this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think we should define a new attribute, because this distinction is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one which applies only to the real-world calendar. It's therefore more robust
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and simpler to indicate it as a modifier to the name when applicable in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the calendar att, so making a new calendar name, in effect. But given this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion I agree that calling it just &quot;UTC&quot; may not be clear enough. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real-world calendar is called &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;gregorian&quot;. I would propose a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility &quot;proleptic_gregorian_utc&quot;, meaning the proleptic Gregorian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar with leap seconds inserted as applicable since 1958.
</em><br />
Adding a calendar such as &quot;gregorian_utc&quot; and redefining the definition 
<br />
of &quot;gregorian&quot; is insufficient to address all of the issues. As far as 
<br />
calendars and time systems go, we have two options:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;* &lt;whatever calendar&gt; without leap seconds
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* &lt;whatever calendar&gt; with UTC leap seconds
<br />
<br />By the way, here's a pretty exhaustive discussion of all the different 
<br />
time systems.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/timescales.html">http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/timescales.html</a>
<br />
<br />The best option I have come up with for naming the time system without 
<br />
leap seconds is &quot;traditional&quot;. There doesn't seem to be a name for the 
<br />
&quot;60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day&quot; time 
<br />
system. The word traditional is used by the Bureau International des 
<br />
Poids et Mesures in their description of the non-SI units of minutes, 
<br />
hours, and days that are accepted for use with SI units.
<br />
<br />So we could answer issue 1. by calling the time system that's like UTC 
<br />
but without leap seconds the &quot;traditional&quot; time system. We could also 
<br />
use the name &quot;POSIX&quot;, and that is kind of evocative since it reflects 
<br />
the potential for glitches, but POSIX also defines an epoch date &amp; time 
<br />
which this time system lacks. I'd be good either way though.
<br />
<br />We could answer issue 2. by defining the existing calendars as including 
<br />
the &quot;traditional&quot; time system and adding more calendars with &quot;_utc&quot; 
<br />
tacked on to original names, but this glosses over the fact that we 
<br />
actually can't be sure what we have in existing datasets. We could 
<br />
instead revise the definition of the &quot;calendar&quot; attribute to include an 
<br />
optional space-separated modifier that would name the time system used 
<br />
for the time part of the reference date &amp; time. So instead of adding new 
<br />
calendars, we would allow values of the calendar attribute to be
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calendar = &quot;&lt;calendar&gt; [&lt;time system&gt;]&quot;
<br />
<br />where the '&lt;&gt;' indicate placeholders for the things named within them, 
<br />
and the '[]' indicate optional inclusion. The values for the &lt;time 
<br />
system&gt; modifer would be
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;unknown&quot; - This is the default if no time system modifier is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specified. Users should be aware that the reference time in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;units attribute may or may not be based on a system (such as UTC)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that includes leap seconds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;traditional&quot; - This indicates that the reference time in the units
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute is based on a traditional &quot;60 seconds in a minute, 60
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, base time zone at the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenwich meridian&quot; time system. No leap seconds are included in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this time system. (Like I said, I'd be OK with calling this &quot;posix&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;utc&quot; - This indicates that the reference time in the units
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;includes adjustments and leap seconds after 1958.
<br />
<br />So, you could have calendar attribute combinations such as &quot;gregorian 
<br />
utc&quot; or &quot;gregorian traditional&quot;, and &quot;proleptic_gregorian&quot; would 
<br />
indicate that there is uncertainty (which there is for all existing data 
<br />
sets) as to which time system was used. You could define the modifier as 
<br />
only applying to the &quot;real world&quot; calendars to prevent weird 
<br />
combinations such as &quot;noleap utc&quot;. I think that this is a better way to 
<br />
handle this within the calendar attribute.
<br />
<br />That leaves issue 3. The solutions to the first two issues don't address 
<br />
this issue. This is where the difference between a time system or 
<br />
calendar and a calculator come up.
<br />
<br />We could add a further modifier in the calendar attribute with three 
<br />
possible values:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;true_elapsed&quot; - the elapsed time values are certain to be free of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leap second discontinuities
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;false_elapsed&quot; - the elapsed time values will include one or more
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leap second discontinuities if any leap second application dates
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were included in the time span from the reference time in the units
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute to any of the time values.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;unknown&quot; - the elapsed time values might include leap second
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discontinuities, but it is not known if they do or not. (the default)
<br />
<br />This extends the calendar attribute definition to be
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calendar = &quot;&lt;calendar&gt; [&lt;time system&gt;] [&lt;elapsed time type&gt;]&quot;
<br />
<br />We could do it this way. I tend to think that the last one might be 
<br />
better handled as a separate attribute, but I'd be OK with this approach.
<br />
<br />Grace and peace,
<br />
<br />Jim
