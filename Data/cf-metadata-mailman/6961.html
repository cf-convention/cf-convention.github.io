<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A postscript to my last message. I am not myself convinced that the backward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompatibility (for data-writing) that I suggested below is really worth the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pain it would cause! I think it might well be OK to retain the existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar name of &quot;gregorian&quot; from CF1.7, but give it a more precise definition,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in order to eliminate the ambiguity about leap seconds. (Of course, there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing we can do to remedy this with existing data.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With all the arguments otherwise unaltered, that would make my proposal:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * We redefine &quot;gregorian&quot;, and introduce a new calendar &quot;gregorian_utc&quot;, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real-world calendar, without and with UTC leap seconds respectively.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * We abolish the &quot;standard&quot; calendar (since one thing this discussion has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shown is that there is not a single standard!) and we require the calendar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always to be specified (no default).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * We state that all the other calendars have fixed-length days with no leap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My further suggestions, about dealing with the Julian/Gregorian transition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and negative years in better ways, are unaffected (except to retain the name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;gregorian&quot;). Those are an optional extra, dealing with a different subject,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it would be opportune to do both at once.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Jim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I'm glad we appear to be approaching an agreement!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;In order to calculate a new date and time given a base date, base time and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; time increment one must know what calendar to use.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and I think that is the sense in which I am using &quot;calendar&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree that this is a CF-consistent usage of the word calendar, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it runs against natural usage, and I think it's worth keeping that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. Perhaps we can clarify what we mean in the CF convention.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree that leap seconds haven't been carefully considered before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I disagree that nearly all existing time values have been encoded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without leap seconds. I'd say that nearly all existing time values
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that were derived from true UTC timestamps are at risk of having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; leap second discontinuities encoded into the set of values.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All right. In that case I think we may have to take more serious steps to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; avoid future problems. I'll come back to that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There are three issues here, so let's not conflate them. They are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1. What to call the time system that is like UTC in overall form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     (Greenwich meridian, etc) but doesn't include leap seconds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2. How to indicate which actual time system is being used for the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     part of the reference time in the units attribute.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3. How to indicate whether or not the elapsed times in the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     variable are certain to be free of leap second induced discontinuities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a useful classification, thanks, but I don't think the situation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite as complicated as that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure (2) is something we need to be concerned about - but it may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be I've missed a point. In my understanding, there is no calendar implied by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reference time, because it's given as a timestamp YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [+-hh:mm], where the [] is the optional time-zone. A timestamp is calendar-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neutral; it can be interpreted in any calendar, except that some dates will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illegal in some calendars, and some times might be illegal if leap seconds are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in effect. The reference date-time is used for encoding and decoding in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar specified, with or without leap seconds, but itself implies nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the time system. We could state it as a requirement of CF that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference date and time must be legal in the encoding which applies to the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordinate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regarding part of (1), we need a name for the time-zone which applies at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Greenwich meridian without summer/daylight-saving time. We shouldn't use &quot;UTC&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the CF standard currently does (quoting from udunits(3)), because that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confusing. Maybe it should just be stated explicitly as I have done!
</em><br />
I agree that it's important to write an explicit definition of the 
<br />
timestamp that doesn't reference UTC. I don't see timestamps as being 
<br />
time system neutral any more than datestamps are calendar neutral. They 
<br />
may be interpretable by more than one system, but that's not the same 
<br />
thing in my mind as neutrality.
<br />
<br />You can read a Gregorian date as a Julian date, but you are going to be 
<br />
off by a number of days. You can read a UTC time as a traditional time, 
<br />
but you are going to be off by a number of seconds. The new calendars 
<br />
you propose would address the question of what systems (calendar and 
<br />
time) were used for all parts of the time reference in the units 
<br />
attribute. That is what they accomplish, they address point (2). They 
<br />
don't really address point (3) at all.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To address point (3), I continue to favour a subspecies of calendar name,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than a modifier or separate attribute, because this distinction only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applies to the real-world calendars. A decomposition of metadata is cumbersome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it isn't generally relevant. Suppose X can take values X1 or X2; if it's X1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then Y can be Y1 or Y2, whereas Y is irrelevant if it's X2. In that situation I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have a single attribute with possible values X1_Y1 X1_Y2 and X2. A single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute is easier for scanning a dataset, less work to write and read, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more likely to be correct because it's less likely that Y will not be coded if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevant or will be coded if irrelevant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suggest that the leap seconds are needed only in the Gregorian calendar i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real-world one. I think it's unlikely the proleptic Gregorian calendar will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be used with leap-seconds; you only need this calendar if you're going back
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than several centuries, in which case it's probably not a dataset which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has UTC precision in time, and it's most often used with models, which do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have leap seconds. (However, a leap-second variety could be introduced if I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong and it is needed.) Leap seconds are not needed in the noleap, all_leap,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 360_day and none calendars, which are all for model worlds. The julian calendar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is used astronomically and might be used in models, but the web page you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cited (<a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/timescales.html">http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/timescales.html</a>) points out that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a good idea to try to use it with leap seconds since it's based on units
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of day (=86400 s).
</em><br />
Point (3) relates to the question of which calculator (implementation of 
<br />
a calendar and/or time system as software for converting date and/or 
<br />
time stamps to elapsed times since an epoch) was used to create the 
<br />
elapsed time values found in a given time variable. This question is 
<br />
largely independent of the question of which systems are represented by 
<br />
the reference date and time in the units attribute. An example in terms 
<br />
of dates alone may help clarify the issue.
<br />
<br />I have a set of datestamps that are based on the Gregorian calendar. I 
<br />
calculate elapsed days from the reference date stored in my units 
<br />
attribute on my time variable and populate my time variable with the 
<br />
values. I use a calculator that is based on the rules of the Julian 
<br />
calendar to get my elapsed times.
<br />
<br />As long as the span of dates from the reference date to the last 
<br />
datestamp in my set don't cross any year where the two calendars differ 
<br />
on whether or not to add a leap day, the values stored in my time 
<br />
variable will be correct. But a 1-day discontinuity will be encoded into 
<br />
my elapsed day values each time I do cross a place where the Julian and 
<br />
Gregorian calendars differ.
<br />
<br />If I turn my elapsed dates back into datestamps using the same Julian 
<br />
date calculator, no one will notice. If I instead use a Gregorian date 
<br />
calculator to recover datestamps and one or more discontinuities were 
<br />
encoded, I will find that I don't get back the same set of datestamps I 
<br />
started with. If I try to take differences between time variable values 
<br />
and one or more discontinuities were encoded, I will find that the 
<br />
results will contain an error if the difference is taken across the 
<br />
location of a discontinuity.
<br />
<br />This may sound a bit silly when speaking of Gregorian vs Julian 
<br />
calendars, but this is exactly what has been happening on the time 
<br />
system level when people have received UTC timestamps and naively used 
<br />
the *nix time functions to create elapsed time values to store into time 
<br />
variables. More explicitly defining the time system used for the time 
<br />
part of the reference date and time in the units attribute via an 
<br />
expanded calendar definition does not tell you how the elapsed times 
<br />
stored in the time variable were calculated.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this is the case, then I would propose that in the next version of CF:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * We introduce two new calendars, &quot;gregorian_noleaps&quot; and &quot;gregorian_utc&quot;, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real-world calendar, without and with UTC leap seconds respectively. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggest &quot;noleaps&quot; instead of &quot;traditional&quot;, which you put forward, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;noleaps&quot; is more self-explanatory, I think. I agree with you that &quot;POSIX&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not so good because it implies a reference time.
</em><br />
I agree with Ben Hetland that if we were to go with new calendars to 
<br />
address point (2) we should use a name like gregorian_noleapseconds or 
<br />
gregorian_noleapsec. I disagree with Ben about the question of how 
<br />
difficult it is to parse a fixed &quot;calender [time-system [encoding]]&quot; 
<br />
sequence.
<br />
<br />I think that backward compatibility, among other things, argues in favor 
<br />
of adding trailing space-separated modifiers to existing calendar names. 
<br />
Even if we end up going with some version of your proposed new calendar 
<br />
names, it's important to understand that those new names and definitions 
<br />
don't solve the issue in point (3).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * We abolish the &quot;gregorian&quot; and &quot;standard&quot; calendars, and we require the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar always to be specified (no default). This would be quite a radical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step, but forcing the noleaps/utc property to be explicitly stated is only way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can see to avoid in future the ambiguity about whether elapsed times have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been encoded with or without leap seconds. This does not invalidate existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data that adheres to CF1.6 or earlier, but it would invalidate existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data-writing software that does not write the calendar attribute, and it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; require data-reading software to recognise the new calendars (although if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumed the existing default for them that would not be too bad).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * We state that all the other calendars have fixed-length days with no leap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you think? Is it worth the pain?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although it's going to complicate this discussion, if we decided to abolish the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing default, we could take this opportunity to deal with problems with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mixed Julian/Gregorian calendar, as in <a href="http://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/96">http://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/96</a>,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opened by Dave Allured, but never concluded. To do that I would further propose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (copying some text from that ticket):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * The gregorian_noleaps and gregorian_utc calendars can be used only to encode
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dates since 1582-10-15, and must not have reference dates earlier than that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means they cannot cross the Julian/Gregorian transition. This is desirable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because there are ambiguities introduced by assuming different dates for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change in calendar. By this rule, the common choice of 1-1-1 as a reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; date would be disallowed in these calendars, for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * We introduce a new calendar &quot;mixed_gregorian_julian&quot;, which is the calendar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of udunits, with no leap seconds. However we make it stricter than currently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in these ways: (1) The reference date is not allowed to be any of the dates in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the transitional period 1582-10-5 to 1582-10-14 inclusive. (2) Neither the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference date nor any date which is encoded with this calendar is allowed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a negative year. (3) Year 0 is interpreted as climatological time in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar, following COARDS, but this is deprecated in favour of the CF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventions of Sect 7.4.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * Because of problems caused by the discontinuity, it is recommended that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mixed_gregorian_julian calendar be used only in datasets with real-world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; historical dates which span the change of calendar from Julian to Gregorian. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; datasets with real-world historical dates that all precede the change of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar, the julian calendar should be used. In datasets with real-world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; historical dates that all follow the change of calendar, and in simulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; datasets in which there is no change of calendar, the proleptic_gregorian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar should be used.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * We disallow dates to be encoded or reference dates to be used in year zero or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negative years for the julian calendar, because it's ambiguous whether this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar has a year 0.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * We state that year 0 is valid in the proleptic_gregorian, noleap, all_leap,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 360_day and none calendars.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If these further proposals complicate the previous discussion, we can defer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them until we've reached agreement on leap seconds!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
