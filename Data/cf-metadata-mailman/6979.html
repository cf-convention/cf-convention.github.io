Dear Peter and Judith
<br />
<br />We are all specialists in our own fields. I didn't mean to imply that your
<br />
field is any more or less esoteric! I was just making the point that standard
<br />
name are often not the terms customarily employed. They aim to be more self-
<br />
explanatory for a wide range of disciplines. A standard name is often more
<br />
an answer to the question &quot;What does that mean?&quot; rather than &quot;What do you
<br />
(usually) call that?&quot; Working out names that are correct for the experts
<br />
concerned and comprehensible for others is often quite difficult, takes time
<br />
and is not infrequently frustrating (as this apparently is to you already).
<br />
However I think that it's because we (the CF community) have spent so many
<br />
hundreds or thousands of hours doing it that we have produced a vocabulary
<br />
people find useful. I hope that's true, anyway. If not, it's been a waste of a
<br />
non-negligible part of my working time at least for the last 15 years. :-)
<br />
<br />I agree that when we don't use standard terms, it may be a problem for
<br />
someone who is looking up standard names in the table, with the aim of finding
<br />
the one they want. We can often help with this by mentioning other things
<br />
the quantity is called in its definition, so the user of the table will find
<br />
it easily by searching the definitions.
<br />
<br />I agree that &quot;flux&quot; is not the exactly correct word. We did discuss this, 15
<br />
years ago, and for the record I would have preferred flux_density. But that
<br />
wasn't the choice we made, and now we have more than 200 standard names with
<br />
the word &quot;flux&quot; in them, meaning something per m2 (not necessarily radiation
<br />
- many of them are mass flux densities). We must be consistent, so the only
<br />
alternative is to rename them all. We could do that. That's a &quot;detachable&quot;
<br />
question which I'll post in another thread. I don't think it's black-and-white
<br />
because &quot;flux&quot; *is* very often used to mean m-2 quantities in geoscience. As
<br />
with language in general, usage determines correctness. There's no point in
<br />
saying something which is always used in a language is wrong. Languages are
<br />
just conventions, not physical laws.
<br />
<br />An irradiance is a radiative flux density, isn't it. If that's correct, I think
<br />
it's clearer not to use the word &quot;irradiance&quot;, because more people will under-
<br />
stand radiative flux density. Is there any extra meaning in &quot;irradiance&quot;?
<br />
<br />There is a solution to the &quot;shortwave&quot; problem. We could call this quantity
<br />
solar_radiative_flux[_density], where &quot;solar&quot; just means &quot;from the sun&quot;, of
<br />
course. We have many other standard names with &quot;radiative_flux&quot; in them, not
<br />
specifying wavelength range. The issue of &quot;shortwave&quot; came up because of
<br />
wanting to establish whether the quantity was one we already have a name for.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I'm not sure whether by TOA irradiance you mean the flux incident
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal to the Earth's surface or parallel to the vector between Sun
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Earth.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I confess to not understanding it until you just added this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;These differ by a factor of 4.&quot; That was the clue I needed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand your question although you've erred by a factor of two.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think I have. toa_incoming_shortwave_flux is 1/4 of the quantity you
<br />
mean, when averaged over time, don't you agree.
<br />
<br />Apart from the factor of 4, the additional point of your quantity is that it
<br />
is at_standard_orbital_radius, if I understand correctly.
<br />
<br />So, if we had a standard name of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;solar_radiative_flux[_density]_at_standard_orbital_radius
<br />
would it be correct and comprehensible to an expert? Maybe they would ask
<br />
&quot;Why didn't they call it TSI?&quot; but that's not the question. Is it a correct
<br />
description of TSI? It would be useful to have a standard name for this
<br />
obviously important quantity.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
