Dear Rich S and Rich P,
<br />
<br />Thanks for advising on the definition.
<br />
<br />Rich Pawlowicz does seem to be suggesting that TEOS-10 should be the only source of conversion formulae. For absolute, preformed and reference salinity that makes sense as those quantities are defined by TEOS-10, aren?t they? Does it also provide conversion to/from Cox and Knudsen salinity?
<br />
<br />For the less specific quantities, such as sea_water_salinity and sea_surface_salinity, the discussion in this thread suggests that these are likely to be either model output or satellite retrievals. I assume that people probably shouldn?t try converting them to one of the more precisely defined salinities as it wouldn?t be clear how to do it.
<br />
<br />Combining these points with Nan?s suggestions and my most recent iteration of the definition leads us to:
<br />
?Practical Salinity is defined on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78) and is calculated from the electrical conductivity of sea water (as well as temperature and pressure). Practical Salinity is not a direct measure of salt concentration, rather, it is a relative scale calibrated against a standard potassium chloride solution containing 32.4356 g kg-1 of KCl whose conductivity is measured at 15 degrees Celsius. Conversion of Practical Salinity to other precisely defined salinity measures should be performed by application of the appropriate formulas specified by TEOS-10. This name should not be used to describe salinity observations made before 1978, or ones not based on conductivity measurements. There are also standard names for the precisely defined salinity quantities sea_water_knudsen_salinity (S_K),  used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966, sea_water_cox_salinity (S_C),  used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977, sea_water_absolute_salinity (S_A), sea_water_preformed_s<br />
alinity (S_*),  and sea_water_reference_salinity. Salinity quantities that do not match any of the precise definitions should be given the more general standard name of sea_water_salinity. Reference:www.teos-10.org; Lewis, 1980 doi:10.1109/JOE.1980.1145448.?
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />

<br />
<br /><br />Rich - I think that is basically OK:
<br />
<br />A very esoteric quibble is that  ?conductance? should be
<br />
used in place of ?conductivity? in this sentence:
<br />
<br />Rather,
<br />
Practical Salinity is a relative scale calibrated against a standard
<br />
potassium chloride solution containing 32.4356 g kg-1 of KCl whose
<br />
conductivity is measured at 15 degrees Celsius.
<br />
<br />because ?conductance? is actually the measured quantity, whereas
<br />
?conductivity? is the physical quantity we wish to measure, but
<br />
this raises other definitional issues that are just not worth going into
<br />
for this purpose - so leaving it as conductivity is least problematic.
<br />
<br />Let?s see?.maybe change this sentence:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Conversion of
<br />
Practical Salinity to other salinity measures should be performed by
<br />
application of the appropriate formula, for example, using the GSW
<br />
Oceanographic Toolbox. I
<br />
<br />to:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Conversion of Practical Salinity to other salinity measures
<br />
should be performed by application of the appropriate formulas
<br />
specified by TEOS-10.
<br />
<br />(since the GSW toolbox merely implements these)

<br /><br />Dear Nan, All,
<br />
<br />I think we have reached agreement to change the canonical units of
<br />
Practical Salinity from 1e-3 to 1. I've now had some time to work on
<br />
the definition.
<br />
<br />Currently in the standard name table we have:
<br />
sea_water_practical_salinity (canonical units: 1e-3)
<br />
Practical Salinity, S_P, is defined on the Practical Salinity Scale of
<br />
1978 (PSS-78) and is calculated from the electrical conductivity of
<br />
sea water (as well as temperature and pressure). Officially S_P is
<br />
dimensionless so that, while convenient, and while it is common
<br />
practice, it is not officially sanctioned to say S_P = 35 psu. Often
<br />
authors use PSS-78, as in S_P = 35 PSS-78. If salinity was measured
<br />
using remote sensing techniques and not conductivity, then it is
<br />
recommended that additional metadata (calibration/validation
<br />
information) be described in the variable comment attribute. This name
<br />
should be used to describe salinity observations made from 1978
<br />
onwards (Practical Salinity is the salinity quantity stored by
<br />
national data centres for post-1978 observations). The only exception
<br />
to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to
<br />
be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. There are also standard
<br />
names for the precisely defined salinity quantities sea_wat
<br />
er_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901
<br />
and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations
<br />
between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A,
<br />
sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity.
<br />
Salinity quantities that do not match any of the precise definitions
<br />
should be given the more general standard name of sea_water_salinity.
<br />
Reference: www.teos-10.org&lt;<a href="http://www.teos-10.org">http://www.teos-10.org</a>&gt;; Lewis, 1980 doi:10.1109/JOE.1980.1145448
<br />
<br />I suggest we change this to the following (note the addition of the
<br />
4th - 6th sentences):
<br />
sea_water_practical_salinity (canonical units: 1)
<br />
Practical Salinity, S_P, is defined on the Practical Salinity Scale of
<br />
1978 (PSS-78) and is calculated from the electrical conductivity of
<br />
sea water (as well as temperature and pressure). Officially S_P is
<br />
dimensionless so that, while convenient, and while it is common
<br />
practice, it is not officially sanctioned to say S_P = 35 psu. Often
<br />
authors use PSS-78, as in S_P = 35 PSS-78. Practical Salinity is not a
<br />
direct measure of salt concentration and the units should not be
<br />
interpreted as describing concentration in g kg-1 or parts per
<br />
thousand as is the case with some other measures of salinity. Rather,
<br />
Practical Salinity is a relative scale calibrated against a standard
<br />
potassium chloride solution containing 32.4356 g kg-1 of KCl whose
<br />
conductivity is measured at 15 degrees Celsius. Conversion of
<br />
Practical Salinity to other salinity measures should be performed by
<br />
application of the appropriate formula, for example, using the GSW
<br />
Oceanographic Toolbox. If Practical Salinity was measure
<br />
d using remote sensing techniques and not conductivity, then it is
<br />
recommended that additional metadata (calibration/validation
<br />
information) be described in the variable comment attribute. This name
<br />
should be used to describe salinity observations made from 1978
<br />
onwards (Practical Salinity is the salinity quantity stored by
<br />
national data centres for post-1978 observations). The only exception
<br />
to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to
<br />
be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. There are also standard
<br />

<br />
sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations
<br />
between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity
<br />
observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A,
<br />
sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity.
<br />
Salinity quantities that do not match any of the precise definitions
<br />
should be given the more general standard name of sea_water_salinit
<br />
y. Reference: www.teos-10.org&lt;<a href="http://www.teos-10.org">http://www.teos-10.org</a>&gt;; Lewis, 1980 doi:10.1109/JOE.1980.1145448
<br />
<br />This definition is turning into something of an essay, but I think
<br />
that is preferable to continued confusion about the meaning of the
<br />
quantity or the interpretation of its units. Does it fit the bill?
<br />
(The scale_factor attribute, mentioned in an earlier post, is defined
<br />
solely for the purpose of data packing and should not be used to
<br />
indicate the scaling of units, e.g. interpreting 0.001 as meaning 1.)
<br />
Also, is the GSW Toolbox a software library? Is there a reference to
<br />
it?
<br />
<br />Any names that mention absolute_salinity, preformed_salinity or
<br />
reference_salinity will definitely keep their units of g kg-1. All
<br />
these names were added as the result of a long discussion of TEOS-10
<br />
quantities and it was very carefully specified what their units should
<br />
be.
<br />
<br />Roy's enquiry to the TEOS-10 group also indicates that the quantities
<br />
sea_water_cox_salinity and sea_water_knudsen_salinity should keep
<br />
their units of 0.001. Indeed, their definitions already specify that
<br />
they should be expressed as  'unitless as a mass fraction per mil
<br />
(0/00) or &quot;parts per thousand&quot; ' so it is very clear how to interpret
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />Rich, Craig and Roy discussed sea_surface_salinity. At the moment this
<br />
is a generic name and not tied to any precise definition of salinity.
<br />
(The standard name definition makes a statement to that effect). The
<br />
question was raised as to whether sea_surface_salinity should be
<br />
regarded as Practical Salinity: the answer appears to be definitely
<br />
&quot;no&quot;. There is therefore no proposal to change the units of this
<br />
quantity at present so it will remain as 0.001. The definition will
<br />
also remain unchanged.
<br />
<br />Other generic salinity names (nine in total) including
<br />
sea_ice_salinity and sea_water_salinity also currently have units of
<br />
0.001. As with sea_surface_salinity I don't think there is actually a
<br />
specific proposal to change them so we should leave the units alone.
<br />
As Jonathan has pointed out, these generic quantities are particularly
<br />
useful for model data and I don't think that we should be trying to
<br />
tie them down any more precisely.
<br />
<br />So what this now boils down to is that we are only discussing changes
<br />
to the canonical units of sea_water_practical_salinity and the
<br />
accompanying definition. If we can agree the definition text then I
<br />
think the change can be accepted for publication in the standard name
<br />
table.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
