Dear Jim
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I appreciate your willingness to continue this attempt to find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meeting of the minds about all of this. I hope you will forgive me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if I am not always completely clear in my attempts to express myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or fail to understand you.
</em><br />
<br />I would say exactly the same to you! Thanks. Actually I'm struggling to
<br />
understand what we are disagreeing about.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a data consumer, all I have to do is convert the reference time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the stated calendar to my desired calender, then use that as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the basis for producing timestamps from the elapsed times in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable (using the correct set of time functions, of course).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Expressing the elapsed times as timestamps in one calendar and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; converting those timestamps to another is another way that you could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do it, but one which adds unneeded steps.
</em><br />
<br />In both our views, decoding the time coord (into components of time, which
<br />
I will refer to as &quot;timestamps&quot; for convenience although we would probably not
<br />
use strings for this purpose, since usually we want numbers) according to the
<br />
calendar stated by the attribute requires using the algorithm appropriate for
<br />
the calendar. This algorithm is one which can add an offset to the reference
<br />
timestamp using the rules of the calendar to produce new timestamps, and the
<br />
reverse. Hence the calendar attribute implies particular rules for encoding and
<br />
decoding. But that is the statement of mine which you disagree with, I think -
<br />
isn't it?
<br />
<br />I agree that the calendar attribute also states the calendar in which the ref
<br />
time is expressed - this second function is one I have recognised because of
<br />
our discussion (it is obvious in the case of model calendars, so I didn't see
<br />
it as a distinct function). Since the att states the calendar of the ref time,
<br />
and implies the rules for encoding and decoding, it therefore also inevitably
<br />
implies the calendar of the decoded timestamps, doesn't it?
<br />
<br />I agree that you could change to a new calendar in the real world by
<br />
calculating the difference in seconds between the ref time if it's interpreted
<br />
in the old calendar and if it's interpreted in the new calendar (or a new
<br />
ref time if you want to change the ref time as well as the calendar) and then
<br />
adjusting the time coordinates by this amount (and the ref time in the units
<br />
string if you want to change that as well). I think that will be the same as
<br />
what I suggested, which is to decode the coords using the old calendar and
<br />
ref time, then encode them using the new calendar and ref time. Perhaps my
<br />
method sounds like more calculation, but it might be easier to carry out (just
<br />
two subroutine calls). I think these methods are equivalent, aren't they?
<br />
<br />They work because, as we agree, the encoded time coord is also an elapsed time,
<br />
and is useful as such. The only situation in which it might have small dis-
<br />
continuities is if the no-leap-second algorithm is used to encode and decode
<br />
UTC and, as we have agreed, there should be a clear warning against not doing
<br />
that if precision &lt;1 min is required.
<br />
<br />The reason that I regard timestamps as primary, and therefore suggest that one
<br />
would go via timestamps to change the calendar, is because of the non-real-
<br />
world calendars that are the subject of other emails. Although, as you rightly
<br />
say, there is no exact way to draw an equivalence between the real-world
<br />
and the various non-real-world calendars (360_day, no_leap, etc.), we have to
<br />
draw such an equivalence for model-model and model-obs comparisons. The main
<br />
purpose of CF is to clarify when and how data is to be regarded as comparable,
<br />
and it's a common need to compare climate data in different calendars. When
<br />
this is done, it's the timestamps which are comparable. DJF (season) is DJF
<br />
(including all of Dec, Jan and Feb) whichever calendar is used, even though it
<br />
has different lengths in those calendars. Therefore it is the timestamps which
<br />
truly define the ranges of time, not the relative time coordinates.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
