<br />
Dear Jim and Karl
<br />
<br />Thanks for your emails.
<br />
<br />To Jim, I think I spoke too soon! I do agree that it's better to be precise,
<br />
but I'm concerned on reflection that there are two uses of real-world time
<br />
encoded as if there were no leap seconds in the real world:
<br />
<br />* Observational data or models run with observational input, where the data
<br />
is timestamped in UTC, but encoded as coordinates without leap seconds. This
<br />
is what we agreed to call gregorian_utc_nls. In this case we pretend that the
<br />
real world has a constant day-length and no leap seconds.
<br />
<br />* Models run to resemble the real world, with the real-world calendar and the
<br />
intention to compare actual weather or climate with model output, but without
<br />
leap seconds. CMIP5 historical and AMIP experiments are in this category, for
<br />
which some models use the real-world calendar (but no leap seconds), and some
<br />
of the input (for instance SSTs and atmospheric composition) refers to the
<br />
real-world calendar. However it is model data, and the model definitely does
<br />
not have leap seconds, so cannot truly be UTC at all. It actually is running
<br />
with a constant day-length. Thus we can't rightly call this gregorian_utc_nls.
<br />
It would be more accurate to call it gregorian_nls (not UTC, not GPS).
<br />
<br />However the distinction between gregorian_utc_nls and gregorian_nls is very
<br />
subtle. I can barely see it myself, even when writing about it! I expect it
<br />
would not reliably be made by data-producers. Therefore I'd like to revert to
<br />
gregorian_nls for both cases. I think this only applies to UTC really. GPS
<br />
does not have leap seconds anyway, so a special no-leap-second encoding would
<br />
only be needed if you put a reference time for GPS before the GPS epoch. Maybe
<br />
we should disallow that, to avoid this ambiguity.
<br />
<br />Therefore, with apologies, I have to ask the opposite question of whether you
<br />
could live with gregorian_nls to mean encoded UTC when it's truly real-world
<br />
data. I don't think it's satisfactory to call it just &quot;gregorian&quot; because we
<br />
have also recognised the need for a deliberately imprecise situation, when it's
<br />
not known if it's GPS or UTC or how encoded. gregorian_nls is precisely 86400-
<br />
second days, encoded as such, by intention.
<br />
<br />Karl, do you have any comments about this?
<br />
<br />Karl, I agree with your analysis. Jim and I also discussed ways of changing
<br />
the calendar, and we decided it wasn't essential to the definitions as such
<br />
to say how you could do it. Another possibility for changing from UTC to GPS
<br />
or v-v is to alter the reference time and its calendar so it refers to the
<br />
same instant in the real world. Then you don't need to alter the encoded time
<br />
coords. For changing between real-world and model calendars, I would argue that
<br />
they are only related via timestamps in principle (that is, January is the same
<br />
in both sorts of calendar only because it's regarded as January and comparable
<br />
for that reason), and the simplest way to convert is to decode the coords to
<br />
timestamps in the old calendar and reencode in the new calendar.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
