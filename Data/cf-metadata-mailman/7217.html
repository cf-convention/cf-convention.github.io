Dear Jim and Jonathan,
<br />
<br />Having tried to learn about UTC and GPS time systems, I think we'll need 
<br />
to find a way to explain to CF users in a simple way what calendar they 
<br />
should use and when.
<br />
<br />The GPS system relies on &quot;24-hour (exactly 86400 sec) wall-clock&quot; 
<br />
without leap seconds added, which means the phase of the solar day 
<br />
(defined by the Sun's position in the sky) slowly gets out of sync with 
<br />
the clock.  The phase shifts primarily because on average the earth 
<br />
takes about 86400.002 seconds to complete a rotation (relative to the 
<br />
position of the sun), which implies a drift of  1 second per 2 years on 
<br />
average, but with some variation around this drift rate because the 
<br />
earth's rotation rate is not constant.   [So we shouldn't say &quot;GPS 
<br />
assumes an 86400 sec *day*&quot;;  it assumes a 86400 sec *clock*, which 
<br />
implies that for our earth, the  phase of the day gets out of sync with 
<br />
the clock.]
<br />
<br />Under the UTC system, leap seconds are added (or removed) when necessary 
<br />
(about every 2 years) to keep the clock in sync with sun. Under the UTC 
<br />
system the sun rises and sets at a UTC time which (to within about a 
<br />
second) depends only on one's location on earth and the orbital 
<br />
longitude (not the year).  This is not the case under the GPS system 
<br />
where there is a slow, somewhat uneven, drift in these times.
<br />
<br />For models, we have a different case from either of these:  the earth 
<br />
rotates once in exactly 86400 seconds (not 86400.002 sec), and so a 
<br />
GPS-like wall clock (without leap seconds) remains in sync with the 
<br />
sun's position in the sky.  This means that our model clock behaves like 
<br />
a UTC clock (by staying in phase), but like a GPS clock in that there 
<br />
are no leap seconds.
<br />
<br />If we had discussed this at the beginning of CF, we could have come up 
<br />
with a simple system:
<br />
<br />&quot;gregorian&quot; representing the model's approximation of nature (by 
<br />
rounding the length of the mean solar day from 86400.002 to 86400) and 
<br />
the use of a clock without a need for leap seconds.  [This is in 
<br />
addition to assuming days follow the gregorian calendar and the rules of 
<br />
when leap years occur.]  By construction, this calendar would only apply 
<br />
to models.
<br />
<br />&quot;gregorian_utc&quot;  used for earth measurements to specify a reference time 
<br />
expressed according to the UTC time-system (and elapsed time correctly 
<br />
recorded).
<br />
<br />&quot;gregorian_gps&quot; used for earth measurements to specify a reference time 
<br />
expressed according to the GPS time-system (and elapsed time correctly 
<br />
recorded).
<br />
<br />In trying to retrofit CF, there are, however, two problems with the 
<br />
above system:
<br />
<br />1)  &quot;gregorian&quot; has in the past, at least, been used for earth 
<br />
measurements (where the day is 86400.002 seconds long)
<br />
2)  In the future some folks may want to specify (incorrectly or 
<br />
imprecisely at least) a reference time expressed according to the UTC 
<br />
time-system but with wall-clock times converted to elapsed time omitting 
<br />
leap seconds.
<br />
<br />As I understand it, our proposed solution is to
<br />
<br />A)  define &quot;gregorian&quot; to be a time-system without leap seconds, with 
<br />
reference times (part of the units)  and elapsed time being somewhat 
<br />
imprecise, so that one can not determine the phase of the diurnal cycle 
<br />
to within better than about 16 seconds (of time) and when comparing two 
<br />
different datasets, time-coordinates that are identical may in fact 
<br />
represent times differing by as much as 16 seconds.  This definition 
<br />
makes gregorian backward compatible in our conventions.
<br />
<br />B)  define &quot;gregorian_utc_nls for a case where the reference time is 
<br />
expressed correctly according to the UTC time-system, *but* elapsed time 
<br />
is given following an algorithm that omits leap seconds (and thus 
<br />
elapsed time may be off by up to 16 seconds).   This would be used only 
<br />
for observational data.
<br />
<br />C)  define &quot;gregorian_nls&quot; for a case where the solar day is exactly 
<br />
86400 seconds long.  This would only be used for models (replacing 
<br />
&quot;gregorian&quot; which was used in the past), but which would exclude the 
<br />
imprecise specification we now propose for &quot;gregorian&quot;).
<br />
<br />Personally, I wouldn't bother with C), at least not now, because with 
<br />
models, I think we can count on the solar day being 86400 seconds long.
<br />
<br />Under my proposal, &quot;gregorian&quot; without a suffix would imply:
<br />
<br />1) if model data, the solar day should be assumed to be 86400 seconds long.
<br />
2) If observational data, one should not rely on the time coordinate 
<br />
being accurate to within better than 16 seconds.
<br />
<br />I also wouldn't bother with B).  If a provider of observational data 
<br />
wants to precisely specify time, then they should follow either 
<br />
&quot;gregorian_nls&quot; or &quot;gregorian_utc&quot;.  Otherwise they should specify 
<br />
&quot;gregorian&quot; which means their coordinate values may be off by as much as 
<br />
16 seconds.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
Karl

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If the input times were GPS times, would you - as a modeler

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; them in your model?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I've never dealt with weather or climate models, but it seems to me

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that while models are precise regarding time, they may not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; accurate - in that having your inputs off by 15 seconds won't make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; material difference in your outputs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is quite true. In that sense it is inaccurate, like the gregorian case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, unlike the gregorian case, it is precise once the data is transplanted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the model world. In the output, I wish to encode a time coordinate of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly midnight on 2015-7-13, for instance, and I want my calendar attribute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to describe this as being in the no-leap-second world, precisely. This means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the data-user will decode my time coordinate precisely correctly. It would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be surprising or confusing if the data-user decoded with leap seconds, getting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a timestamp a quarter of a minute wrong, and &quot;gregorian&quot; would permit that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; option. Also, the user can depend on every day having 86400 seconds, if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coords are used as elapsed times.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best wishes
