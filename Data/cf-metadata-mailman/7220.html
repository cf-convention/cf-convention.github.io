Dear Karl
<br />
<br />Thank you for your useful summary, which I think is quite right. That will
<br />
provide some good text for the standard document.
<br />
<br />You suggest merging gregorian_nls (for models, exactly 86400-second days)
<br />
into gregorian (imprecise about which calendar is used and how encoded),
<br />
distinguishing them according to whether the data is model or observational.
<br />
<br />I'm not comfortable with that. I can't think of another case in CF where the
<br />
metadata is designed to be interpreted differently for models and observations,
<br />
and it would not be easy to do, because there's no metadata that is guaranteed
<br />
to be present in a standard form to tell you if it's model or observational.
<br />
Yet I think this distinction must be made. It would not be satisfactory if
<br />
users interpreted the imprecision of &quot;gregorian&quot; to mean they could decode
<br />
model data e.g. from CMIP using the UTC calendar, and found days that appear to
<br />
start 16 seconds different from midnight. I am sure this would cause problems
<br />
e.g. wrong months selected. That's why I think we need gregorian_nls as a model
<br />
calendar, to be used instead of gregorian in future where applicable. We need
<br />
to be able to assert that the 86400-second day definitely applies.
<br />
<br />I agree with Jim that there is a distinction between gregorian_utc_nls and
<br />
gregorian too. Some people supplying observational data don't require the
<br />
precision of specifying UTC (or GPS), so they don't want to choose gregorian_
<br />
utc or gregorian_gps. Nan argued this case. Others however may wish to be
<br />
precise about UTC timestamps, but choose to encode it without leap seconds.
<br />
So I think we need the meaning of gregorian_utc_nls.
<br />
<br />However, on reflection I convinced myself (at least! - but not Jim) that the
<br />
distinction between gregorian_nls (for models) and gregorian_utc_nls (for
<br />
the real world) is too subtle to make reliably, so I suggested we should use
<br />
gregorian_nls for both, and say that *if* it is observational data, it must
<br />
be UTC. That's not quite the same as your suggestion, because the timestamps
<br />
can be exactly recovered without knowing if it's model or observational, but
<br />
you would need to know in order to tell whether the elapsed times are accurate
<br />
(as they are for model data) or perhaps not accurate (for real world data).
<br />
Whereas I regard timestamps as more important, Jim tends to regard elapsed
<br />
times as more important, so I guess this second issue would count more for him.
<br />
If it is crucial, then we need both gregorian_nls and gregorian_utc_nls. The
<br />
distinction is whether it is model or real-world time. My concern is that when
<br />
when models are used to simulate events that happened in real-world time, data-
<br />
producers may often find it hard to decide between these alternatives, and it's
<br />
unclear whether it's useful to do so anyway.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
