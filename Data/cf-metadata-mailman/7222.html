Dear Jonathan,
<br />
<br />I think we will make it more difficult on users to write and interpret 
<br />
CF data  if the calendar attribute is too complicated and the meaning of 
<br />
&quot;gregorian&quot; changes from what it meant in the past. In the past we got 
<br />
away with a single &quot;gregorian&quot; option, and I suspect all the 
<br />
CF-compliant model output and nearly all the observational data stored 
<br />
under CF would be correctly interpreted if the definition of &quot;gregorian&quot; 
<br />
included the following sentences:
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
Under the &quot;gregorian&quot; calendar the length of the solar day can be 
<br />
assumed to be exactly 86400 seconds long (i.e., there are no leap 
<br />
seconds).  This means that for models where this assumption almost 
<br />
invariably is valid, conversion from elapsed time to clock time is 
<br />
straight-forward and exact, whereas for observations, conversion to 
<br />
clock time may introduce errors as large as 16 seconds because it is 
<br />
unknown whether the UTC or GPS time system has been used in specifying 
<br />
the reference times (appearing in the time units attribute), and it is 
<br />
also unknown whether leap seconds have been properly accounted for in 
<br />
converting UTC clock times to elapsed time.
<br />
----------------------------------
<br />
<br />Interpreted as above, the &quot;gregorian&quot; calendar would make it possible 
<br />
for users to invariably decode *model* output and not encounter the 
<br />
problems you discussed in your first paragraph.  Of course with 
<br />
*observations*, they might encounter such problems, but that's because 
<br />
the observationalist storing the data is apparently o.k. with errors of 
<br />
up to 16 seconds (otherwise they would rewrite their data with one of 
<br />
the newly proposed calendars specifying UTC or GPS).
<br />
<br />In the future, I think we should interpret &quot;gregorian&quot; the same as we 
<br />
have in the past, but we would also offer two new calendars 
<br />
(gregorian_utc and gregorian_gps) for those who need to indicate that 
<br />
their reference times are defined by a specific time system, and one 
<br />
more calendar (gregorian_utc_nls) for those who choose not to properly 
<br />
account for leap seconds in converting from UTC clock time to elapsed 
<br />
time.   These new calendars would mostly be used for observations, but 
<br />
conceivably there might be a model initialized from observations  (and 
<br />
subsequently compared against observations perhaps only a few seconds 
<br />
later), where one would want to precisely record whether the reference 
<br />
time (included in the units) follows the UTC or GPS time system, just as 
<br />
in the observational data set it is being compared with.  In these 
<br />
(rare) cases, the calendar would be indicated as being either 
<br />
gregorian_utc or gregorian_gps for the model output, just as in the 
<br />
observational data set.
<br />
<br />You argue that interpretation of &quot;gregorian&quot; depends on whether it 
<br />
describes observations or model output.  That's true, and apparently 
<br />
that has always been the case.  We can't change that, and why should we 
<br />
change it going forward?
<br />
<br />I don't see a case for including gregorian_nls (for models), unless we 
<br />
decide to redefine &quot;gregorian&quot; to mean:
<br />
<br />&quot;a calendar that: 1) might or might not account for leap seconds, 2) 
<br />
might or might not assume the length of the solar day is exactly 86400 
<br />
seconds long, and 3) might express the reference time according to 
<br />
either UTC or GPS&quot;
<br />
<br />This definition would also be consistent with past usage of &quot;gregorian&quot; 
<br />
but would make virtually all the model data stored already under CF with 
<br />
calendar=&quot;gregorian&quot; seem to be imprecise in specifying the 
<br />
time-coordinates, even though the coordinates are in fact defined such 
<br />
that they can be converted to wall clock time assuming the solar day is 
<br />
exactly 86400 seconds long.  If you want to adopt this alternative 
<br />
definition (rather than the one I suggest in the 2nd paragraph above), 
<br />
then we should probably introduce &quot;gregorian_nls&quot; as a calendar/time 
<br />
system for which the length of the solar day is exactly 86400 seconds 
<br />
long&quot;.    In the future gregorian_nls would probably be used (instead of 
<br />
&quot;gregorian&quot;) in all but a few model-produced datasets.
<br />
<br />best regards,
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Karl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for your useful summary, which I think is quite right. That will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provide some good text for the standard document.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You suggest merging gregorian_nls (for models, exactly 86400-second days)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into gregorian (imprecise about which calendar is used and how encoded),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishing them according to whether the data is model or observational.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not comfortable with that. I can't think of another case in CF where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metadata is designed to be interpreted differently for models and observations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it would not be easy to do, because there's no metadata that is guaranteed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be present in a standard form to tell you if it's model or observational.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet I think this distinction must be made. It would not be satisfactory if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; users interpreted the imprecision of &quot;gregorian&quot; to mean they could decode
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model data e.g. from CMIP using the UTC calendar, and found days that appear to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start 16 seconds different from midnight. I am sure this would cause problems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; e.g. wrong months selected. That's why I think we need gregorian_nls as a model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar, to be used instead of gregorian in future where applicable. We need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be able to assert that the 86400-second day definitely applies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with Jim that there is a distinction between gregorian_utc_nls and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gregorian too. Some people supplying observational data don't require the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precision of specifying UTC (or GPS), so they don't want to choose gregorian_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utc or gregorian_gps. Nan argued this case. Others however may wish to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise about UTC timestamps, but choose to encode it without leap seconds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I think we need the meaning of gregorian_utc_nls.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, on reflection I convinced myself (at least! - but not Jim) that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between gregorian_nls (for models) and gregorian_utc_nls (for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real world) is too subtle to make reliably, so I suggested we should use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gregorian_nls for both, and say that *if* it is observational data, it must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be UTC. That's not quite the same as your suggestion, because the timestamps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be exactly recovered without knowing if it's model or observational, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would need to know in order to tell whether the elapsed times are accurate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (as they are for model data) or perhaps not accurate (for real world data).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whereas I regard timestamps as more important, Jim tends to regard elapsed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times as more important, so I guess this second issue would count more for him.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it is crucial, then we need both gregorian_nls and gregorian_utc_nls. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction is whether it is model or real-world time. My concern is that when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when models are used to simulate events that happened in real-world time, data-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; producers may often find it hard to decide between these alternatives, and it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unclear whether it's useful to do so anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best wishes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
