PS. First, to repeat myself:
<br />
<br />So my conclusion (at present - but I suspect I haven't understood something
<br />
you have said) is that gregorian is fine and sufficient (with the addition of
<br />
gregorian_utc and gregorian_gps for the well-defined real-world systems) if
<br />
we define it to mean that 86400-seconds are assumed to be used for conversion
<br />
from clock time to elapsed time and elapsed time to clock time, that it is not
<br />
defined whether the reference time and clock times are GPS and UTC, and that
<br />
the elapsed times may not be exactly correct for the real world (due to the
<br />
neglect of leap seconds).
<br />
<br />I also said, &quot;This is then the same as gregorian_utc_nls, so we would not need
<br />
that either, which was your final conclusion in your previous post.&quot; Actually
<br />
it's not quite the same as gregorian_utc_nls, which asserts that clock times,
<br />
if real-world, are UTC. Otherwise it's the same. If my conclusion above is
<br />
correct, then I don't mind whether we introduce gregorian_utc_nls or not. No-
<br />
one has definitely asked for it, as far as I remember; we discussed it because
<br />
of anticipating the need, I believe. We could therefore follow the usual CF
<br />
principle of omitting it until it's asked for.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />

<br />
<br />Dear Karl
<br />
<br />I think the meaning of &quot;gregorian&quot; up to CF 1.6 is actually not clear, because
<br />
we had not thought about these distinctions earlier. If we change the calendar
<br />
definitions, it does not affect the interpretation of any existing data written
<br />
with previous versions. However I agree that it would be inconvenient for data-
<br />
users if they had to process &quot;gregorian&quot; times differently according to the
<br />
setting of the Conventions version.
<br />
<br />I thought that the current proposal was that gregorian would be vague in
<br />
future, like you wrote in your second option:
<br />
<br />1) might or might not account for leap seconds, 2) might or might not assume
<br />
the length of the solar day is exactly 86400 seconds long, and 3) might express
<br />
the reference time according to either UTC or GPS
<br />
<br />and that is exactly the reason why, after agreeing with Jim last week, I
<br />
changed my mind to argue that we needed gregorian_nls for model data, to
<br />
preserve the exactness for times which really are always 86400-second days.
<br />
You agree we would need gregorian_nls in that case. I agree that it means that
<br />
models would use gregorian_nls in future, not gregorian.
<br />
<br />However in your first option you don't think this is necessary:
<br />
<br />Under the &quot;gregorian&quot; calendar the length of the solar day can be assumed to be
<br />
exactly 86400 seconds long (i.e., there are no leap seconds).  This means that
<br />
for models where this assumption almost invariably is valid, conversion from
<br />
elapsed time to clock time is straight-forward and exact, whereas for
<br />
observations, conversion to clock time may introduce errors as large as 16
<br />
seconds because it is unknown whether the UTC or GPS time system has been used
<br />
in specifying the reference times (appearing in the time units attribute), and
<br />
it is also unknown whether leap seconds have been properly accounted for in
<br />
converting UTC clock times to elapsed time.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry, but I can't see what is the difference. In both cases you say it
<br />
is unknown whether leap seconds have been included in converting from clock
<br />
time to elapsed time. Is the crucial difference about the length of the day?
<br />
Does &quot;assume the solar day to be exactly 86400 seconds&quot; mean &quot;assume all days
<br />
are 86400 seconds in converting elapsed time to clock time&quot;?
<br />
<br />If that's what you mean, I think your first and preferred option is fine, and
<br />
then I agree we do not need gregorian_nls. To spell it out, I think this is
<br />
acceptable if &quot;gregorian&quot; means that you will recover the clock times (time-
<br />
stamps) exactly by using an algorithm that assumes constant 86400-second days
<br />
(i.e. with no leap seconds). If these clock times refer to the real world, it
<br />
is undefined whether the reference time is GPS or UTC, and consequently it is
<br />
undefined whether the decoded clock times are GPS or UTC.
<br />
<br />But my statement &quot;you will recover the clock times (time-stamps) exactly by
<br />
using an algorithm that assumes constant 86400-second days&quot; is inconsistent
<br />
with your statement &quot;conversion to clock time may introduce errors ... because
<br />
it is unknown whether ... leap seconds have been properly accounted for in 
<br />
converting UTC clock times to elapsed time&quot;. According to my statement,
<br />
gregorian means that leap seconds were ignored when converting clock times to
<br />
elapsed times i.e. 86400-second days were used. If that's not the case, you
<br />
can't decode accurately. Thus the elapsed times may not be quite right for the
<br />
real world. This is then the same as gregorian_utc_nls, so we would not need
<br />
that either, which was your final conclusion in your previous post.
<br />
<br />So my conclusion (at present - but I suspect I haven't understood something
<br />
you have said) is that gregorian is fine and sufficient (with the addition of
<br />
gregorian_utc and gregorian_gps for the well-defined real-world systems) if
<br />
we define it to mean that 86400-seconds are assumed to be used for conversion
<br />
from clock time to elapsed time and elapsed time to clock time, that it is not
<br />
defined whether the reference time and clock times are GPS and UTC, and that
<br />
the elapsed times may not be exactly correct for the real world (due to the
<br />
neglect of leap seconds).
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
