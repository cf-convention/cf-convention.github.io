Hi Jonathan and Jim,
<br />
<br />Thanks for bearing with me as I educate myself and think about this 
<br />
stuff.   I rethought further about what I said yesterday and realized 
<br />
that maybe we were still making this too complicated. Jonathan's 
<br />
discussion helped me to come up with the following:
<br />
<br />Starting with the following claims:
<br />
<br />1)  All model data stored under CF has been generated by models with 
<br />
strict 86400 second mean sidereal days (and no leap seconds are necessary)
<br />
<br />2)  Up to now, the vast majority of all observational data stored under 
<br />
CF has had reference times that can be associated with the UTC calendar 
<br />
(or its predecessor GMT) and the elapsed times have been recorded 
<br />
omitting leap seconds.
<br />
<br />I make the second claim because, for example, folks doing daily 
<br />
measurements or even 3-hourly measurements collected for synoptic 
<br />
weather prediction record that data at certain times of day as dictated 
<br />
by clocks that follow UTC.  For example a measurement might be done 
<br />
every day at 0Z and the person performing the measurement is probably 
<br />
not even aware that every once in a while he had to wait 1 second longer 
<br />
than usual because a leap second was inserted.  When these measurements 
<br />
are recorded as time series, I'd be surprised if anyone has inserted a 
<br />
leap second in computing elapsed time.
<br />
<br />This &quot;sloppiness&quot; in recording elapsed time actually is a blessing to 
<br />
those of us comparing climate model output to observations.  If we want 
<br />
to compare monthly means, for example, we can specify exactly the same 
<br />
time bounds for both observed data and model output and we will extract 
<br />
the data of interest.  If instead leap seconds had been accounted for in 
<br />
calculating elapsed time under the UTC system, then the time bounds 
<br />
would be different from models, certainly giving us headaches and likely 
<br />
leading to mistakes.
<br />
<br />I would therefore advocate to interpret &quot;gregorian&quot; as follows:
<br />
<br />This calendar is based on the assumption that the length of the mean 
<br />
solar day is exactly 86400 seconds.  For observations, the assumption is 
<br />
not in fact exactly correct.  To facilitate comparisons between model 
<br />
results and climate and weather observations, an adjustment in the true 
<br />
elapsed time is required when calendar=&quot;gregorian&quot;.  The reference time 
<br />
should be specified according to the UTC time system, but leap seconds 
<br />
should be omitted in converting from wall-clock time to elapsed time.  
<br />
This means that elapsed time values will only be approximately correct, 
<br />
but this is generally desirable because: 1) simple algorithms can be 
<br />
used to convert from wall-clock time to elapsed time, 2) the mismatch 
<br />
between the model's mean solar day and the actual mean solar day (about 
<br />
.002 seconds) can be ignored in comparing models and observations; 
<br />
observed elapsed times are effectively modified to yield a time series 
<br />
that stays synced with the diurnal cycle we would find if the earth's 
<br />
day were exactly 86400 seconds long.  Note that although elapsed times 
<br />
stored in the CF-conforming file will be only approximate, they will 
<br />
differ by less than 17 seconds (as of July 2015) from the true elapsed time.
<br />
<br />I think this definition means that there is no need for gregorian_utc_nls.
<br />
<br />Although I can see why the two new calendars (gregorian_utc and 
<br />
gregorian_gps) could be used for special cases, I would hope most 
<br />
providers of climate and weather data will continue to use a &quot;gregorian&quot; 
<br />
calendar as defined above.  This will make it much easier for modelers 
<br />
to compare their output to observations.
<br />
<br />best regards,
<br />
Karl

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also said, &quot;This is then the same as gregorian_utc_nls, so we would not need

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's not quite the same as gregorian_utc_nls, which asserts that clock times,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if real-world, are UTC. Otherwise it's the same. If my conclusion above is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct, then I don't mind whether we introduce gregorian_utc_nls or not. No-

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one has definitely asked for it, as far as I remember; we discussed it because

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of anticipating the need, I believe. We could therefore follow the usual CF

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Karl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the meaning of &quot;gregorian&quot; up to CF 1.6 is actually not clear, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we had not thought about these distinctions earlier. If we change the calendar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitions, it does not affect the interpretation of any existing data written
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with previous versions. However I agree that it would be inconvenient for data-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; users if they had to process &quot;gregorian&quot; times differently according to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; setting of the Conventions version.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought that the current proposal was that gregorian would be vague in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future, like you wrote in your second option:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) might or might not account for leap seconds, 2) might or might not assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the length of the solar day is exactly 86400 seconds long, and 3) might express
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reference time according to either UTC or GPS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that is exactly the reason why, after agreeing with Jim last week, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changed my mind to argue that we needed gregorian_nls for model data, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preserve the exactness for times which really are always 86400-second days.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You agree we would need gregorian_nls in that case. I agree that it means that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models would use gregorian_nls in future, not gregorian.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However in your first option you don't think this is necessary:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Under the &quot;gregorian&quot; calendar the length of the solar day can be assumed to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly 86400 seconds long (i.e., there are no leap seconds).  This means that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for models where this assumption almost invariably is valid, conversion from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elapsed time to clock time is straight-forward and exact, whereas for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations, conversion to clock time may introduce errors as large as 16
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds because it is unknown whether the UTC or GPS time system has been used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in specifying the reference times (appearing in the time units attribute), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is also unknown whether leap seconds have been properly accounted for in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; converting UTC clock times to elapsed time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sorry, but I can't see what is the difference. In both cases you say it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is unknown whether leap seconds have been included in converting from clock
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time to elapsed time. Is the crucial difference about the length of the day?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does &quot;assume the solar day to be exactly 86400 seconds&quot; mean &quot;assume all days
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are 86400 seconds in converting elapsed time to clock time&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that's what you mean, I think your first and preferred option is fine, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then I agree we do not need gregorian_nls. To spell it out, I think this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acceptable if &quot;gregorian&quot; means that you will recover the clock times (time-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stamps) exactly by using an algorithm that assumes constant 86400-second days
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. with no leap seconds). If these clock times refer to the real world, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is undefined whether the reference time is GPS or UTC, and consequently it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; undefined whether the decoded clock times are GPS or UTC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But my statement &quot;you will recover the clock times (time-stamps) exactly by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using an algorithm that assumes constant 86400-second days&quot; is inconsistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with your statement &quot;conversion to clock time may introduce errors ... because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is unknown whether ... leap seconds have been properly accounted for in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; converting UTC clock times to elapsed time&quot;. According to my statement,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gregorian means that leap seconds were ignored when converting clock times to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elapsed times i.e. 86400-second days were used. If that's not the case, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't decode accurately. Thus the elapsed times may not be quite right for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real world. This is then the same as gregorian_utc_nls, so we would not need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that either, which was your final conclusion in your previous post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So my conclusion (at present - but I suspect I haven't understood something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have said) is that gregorian is fine and sufficient (with the addition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gregorian_utc and gregorian_gps for the well-defined real-world systems) if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we define it to mean that 86400-seconds are assumed to be used for conversion
