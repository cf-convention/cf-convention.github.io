Dear Alison,
<br />
<br />Thanks for ticketing my proposals.   Your refinements of the language are
<br />
mostly welcome, but I realized I need to clarify one point (thanks to your
<br />
assistance) in items 8 and 9.
<br />
<br />The hydrology people are interested in when a given region is safe to
<br />
enter.  So the question is the time the flood water goes below the
<br />
threshold for the *last* time, not for the *first* time.
<br />
<br />So I'd like to have the first sentences of 8 and 9 like as follows.  I
<br />
always welcome more natural English language.
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
Eizi
<br />
<br /><br />8. time_when_flood_water_falls_below_threshold
<br />
<br />The quantity with standard name time_when_flood_water_falls_below_threshold
<br />
is the time elapsed between the breaking of a levee (origin of flood water
<br />
simulation) and the instant when the depth *first* falls below a given
<br />
threshold, having already risen to its maximum depth, at a given point in
<br />
space.

&gt; Dear Eizi,
&gt;
&gt; My apologies for not joining the original discussion of these names ? I
&gt; was on annual leave at the time. I?ve added entries for all your proposals
&gt; to the list of names under discussion:
&gt; <a href="http://cfeditor.ceda.ac.uk/proposals/1?status=active&amp;namefilter=&amp;proposerfilter=Eizi&amp;descfilter=&amp;unitfilter=&amp;yearfilter=&amp;commentfilter=&amp;filter+and+display=Filter">http://cfeditor.ceda.ac.uk/proposals/1?status=active&amp;namefilter=&amp;proposerfilter=Eizi&amp;descfilter=&amp;unitfilter=&amp;yearfilter=&amp;commentfilter=&amp;filter+and+display=Filter</a>
&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; Regarding the earlier discussion about sea_water, estuaries, rivers,
&gt; runoff, etc., we have had previous conversations on the mailing list about
&gt; a generic name for bodies of water on the earth?s surface, but have never
&gt; reached agreement on a suitable term. I think flood_water is a useful way
&gt; of describing temporary surface water ? if in future there is a need to
&gt; further distinguish between storm surges, tsunamis, and so on, then we can
&gt; always introduce more specific standard names.
&gt;
&gt; The following is a summary of the current status of your proposals. I have
&gt; taken into account the discussion in this thread and in some cases I have
&gt; modified the definitions a little for consistency with existing names. In
&gt; particular, I have added wording in the definitions of the names requiring
&gt; thresholds to make them consistent with the recent discussions we had on
&gt; GOES-R standard names. If you are happy with these suggestions then I think
&gt; we can go ahead and accept all the names for publication in the standard
&gt; name table.
&gt;
&gt; 1. flood_water_thickness (m)
&gt; 'The flood_water_thickness is the vertical distance between the surface of
&gt; the flood water and the surface of the solid ground, as measured at a given
&gt; point in space. The standard name ground_level_altitude is used for a data
&gt; variable giving the geometric height of the ground surface above the geoid.
&gt; &quot;Flood water&quot; is water that covers land which is normally not covered by
&gt; water.'
&gt;
&gt; 2. flood_water_speed (m s-1)
&gt; 'Speed is the magnitude of velocity. Flood water is water that covers land
&gt; which is normally not covered by water.'
&gt;
&gt; 3. eastward_flood_water_velocity (m s-1)
&gt; 'A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component
&gt; which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Flood water
&gt; is water that covers land which is normally not covered by water.'
&gt;
&gt; 4. northward_flood_water_velocity (m s-1)
&gt; 'A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component
&gt; which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). Flood water
&gt; is water that covers land which is normally not covered by water.'
&gt;
&gt; 5. ground_level_altitude (m)
&gt; 'The ground_level_altitude is the geometric height of the upper boundary
&gt; of the solid Earth above the geoid, which is the reference geopotential
&gt; surface. The geoid is similar to mean sea level.'
&gt;
&gt; 6. time_when_flood_water_rises_above_threshold (s)
&gt; 'The quantity with standard name
&gt; time_when_flood_water_rises_above_threshold is the time elapsed between the
&gt; breaking of a levee (origin of flood water simulation) and the instant when
&gt; the depth first rises above a given threshold at a given point in space. If
&gt; a threshold is supplied, it should be specified by associating a coordinate
&gt; variable or scalar coordinate variable with the data variable and giving
&gt; the coordinate variable a standard name of flood_water_thickness. The
&gt; values of the coordinate variable are the threshold values for the
&gt; corresponding subarrays of the data variable. If no threshold is specified,
&gt; its value is taken to be zero. Flood water is water that covers land which
&gt; is normally not covered by water.'
&gt;
&gt; 7. time_of_maximum_flood_depth (s)
&gt; 'The quantity with standard name time_of_maximum_flood_depth is the time
&gt; elapsed between the breaking of a levee (origin of flood water simulation)
&gt; and the instant when the flood depth reaches its maximum during the
&gt; simulation for a given point in space. Flood water is water that covers
&gt; land which is normally not covered by water.'
&gt;
&gt; 8. time_when_flood_water_falls_below_threshold (s)
&gt; 'The quantity with standard name
&gt; time_when_flood_water_falls_below_threshold is the time elapsed between the
&gt; breaking of a levee (origin of flood water simulation) and the instant when
&gt; the depth first falls below a given threshold, having already risen to its
&gt; maximum depth, at a given point in space. If a threshold is supplied, it
&gt; should be specified by associating a coordinate variable or scalar
&gt; coordinate variable with the data variable and giving the coordinate
&gt; variable a standard name of flood_water_thickness. The values of the
&gt; coordinate variable are the threshold values for the corresponding
&gt; subarrays of the data variable. If no threshold is specified, its value is
&gt; taken to be zero. Flood water is water that covers land which is normally
&gt; not covered by water.'
&gt;
&gt; 9. flood_water_duration_above_threshold (s)
&gt; 'The quantity with standard name flood_water_duration_above_threshold is
&gt; the time elapsed between the instant when the flood depth first rises above
&gt; a given threshold until the time it falls below the same threshold for a
&gt; given point in space. If a threshold is supplied, it should be specified by

&gt; Dear Eizi
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd use flood_water_thickness.
&gt; If you're happy with that it and it makes sense to you and your colleagues,
&gt; it would be the choice most consistent with other names.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Your second suggestion height_of_flood_water_surface_above_ground_level
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; no problem at all, but a bit long for beginners of CF.
&gt; I agree.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 9) time_duration_with_flood_water_above_threshold
&gt; &gt; I wonder perhaps &quot;time_duration&quot; could be &quot;duration&quot;, looking at
&gt; &gt; duration_of_sunshine.
&gt; &quot;[time] duration with flood&quot; etc. sounds a bit strange to me. I see that
&gt; &quot;flood water duration&quot; is a phrase that occurs (in Google). Would you
&gt; consider
&gt; flood_water_duration_above_threshold?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Regarding 6), our planned data is only for the case of threshold=zero,
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; it is no problem to generalize the concept to be symmetric with the
&gt; &gt; &quot;falls_below&quot; counterpart.
&gt; OK. I suppose you will need a scalar coordinate variable with a
&gt; standard_name
&gt; of flood_water_thickness to supply the threshold, and this should have a
&gt; default - perhaps zero would be a suitable default.
&gt;
&gt; I think your use of flags and strings to describe hazard conditions is
&gt; good,
&gt; and I appreciate that at this point you don't need to standardise them.
&gt;
&gt; Best wishes
&gt;
