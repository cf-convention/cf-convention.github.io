Dear CF community,
<br />
<br />On behalf of ISMIP6 (The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6), please find below a request for new standard names that are needed for ISMIP6. We thank Alison Pamment and Martin Juckes for their initial review of this proposed list.
<br />
<br />Kind regards,
<br />
<br />Sophie, on behalf of ISMIP6
<br />
<br />Note, in all cases where land_ice is used, we follow the CF definition of &quot;Land ice&quot; meaning glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves (the later is part of the ice sheet that flows over the ocean).
<br />
When ISMIP6 talks about ice sheet models, it generally includes both ice-sheets resting on bedrock and ice shelves, although some models may not include ice shelves. This is the reason that sometime &quot;grounded&quot; is used: to emphasis that when a model includes both ice sheet and ice shelf, we only want the ice sheet part.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 1: temperature_at_ground_level_in_snow_or_firn
<br />
Units: K
<br />
Long name: Temperature at the interface between land ice and snow or firn
<br />
Definition: Surface Temperature that is used to force ice sheet models. It does not vary with seasons. In some models it is the temperature at the base of the snow, and in other at the base of firn (firn is a type of snow that has been left over from past seasons, and is therefore ice that is at an intermediate stage between snow and glacial ice). Report surface temperature of ice sheet where snow or firn thickness is zero
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 2: land_ice_basal_temperature
<br />
Units: K
<br />
Long name: Temperature at the basal interface of the land ice.
<br />
Definition: Basal temperature that is used to force the ice sheet models. Report temperature AT interface. Beneath ice shelves it is the temperature AT ice ocean interface. Beneath grounded ice, it is the temperature AT ice bedrock interface.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 3: land_ice_surface_melt_flux
<br />
Units: kg m-2 s-1
<br />
Long name: Surface ice melt flux
<br />
Definition: Loss of ice mass resulting from surface melting. Computed as the total surface melt water on the land ice portion of the grid cell divided by land ice area in the grid cell.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 4: land_ice_basal_specific_mass_balance_flux
<br />
Units: kg m-2 s-1
<br />
Long name: Land ice basal mass balance flux
<br />
Definition: Specific mass balance means the net rate at which ice is added per unit area at the land ice base. Computed as the total basal mass balance on the land ice portion of the grid cell divided by land ice area in the grid cell. A negative value means loss of ice.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 5: land_ice_specific_mass_flux_due_to_calving
<br />
Units: kg m-2 s-1
<br />
Long name: Land ice calving flux
<br />
Definition: Loss of ice mass resulting from iceberg calving. Computed as the rate of mass loss by the ice shelf (in kg s-1) divided by the horizontal area of the ice sheet (m2) in the grid box.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 6: land_ice_specific_mass_flux_due_to_calving_and_ice_front_melting
<br />
Units: kg m-2 s-1
<br />
Long name: kg m-2 s-1
<br />
Definition: Total mass balance at the ice front (or vertical margin). It includes both iceberg calving and melt on vertical ice front.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 7: water_flux_into_sea_water_from_land_ice
<br />
Units: kg m-2 s-1
<br />
Long name: Water flux into Sea Water from Land Ice
<br />
Definition: Computed as the water flux into the ocean due to land ice (runoff water from surface and base of land ice or melt from base of ice shelf or vertical ice front) into the ocean divided by the area ocean portion of the grid cell.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 8: land_ice_surface_x_velocity
<br />
Units: m s-1
<br />
Long name: X-component of land ice surface velocity
<br />
Definition: u-velocity at land ice surface
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 9: land_ice_surface_y_velocity
<br />
Units: m s-1
<br />
Long name: Y-component of land ice surface velocity
<br />
Definition: v-velocity at land ice surface
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 10: land_ice_surface_upward_velocity
<br />
Units: m s-1
<br />
Long name: Upward component of land ice surface velocity
<br />
Definition: Upward velocity at land ice surface
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 11: land_ice_basal_upward_velocity
<br />
Units: m s-1
<br />
Long name: Upward component of land ice basal velocity
<br />
Definition: Upward velocity at land ice base
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 12: magnitude_of_shear_stress_at_land_ice_base
<br />
Units: Pa
<br />
Long name: Magnitude of land ice basal shear stress
<br />
Definition: The magnitude of the shear stress at land ice base
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 13: magnitude_of_normal_stress_at_land_ice_base
<br />
Units: Pa
<br />
Long name: Magnitude of land ice basal normal stress
<br />
Definition: The magnitude of the normal stress at land ice base
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 14: magnitude_of_longitudinal_stress_at_land_ice_base
<br />
Units: Pa
<br />
Long name: Magnitude of land ice basal longitudinal stress
<br />
Definition: The magnitude of the longitudinal stress at land ice base
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 15: upward_geothermal_heat_flux_at_ground_level
<br />
Units: W m-2
<br />
Long name: Geothermal Heat flux beneath land ice
<br />
Definition: The geothermal heat flux beneath land ice is the geothermal heat flux at the ice-bedrock interface, where ground level means under the ice, in regions covered by land ice
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 16: land_ice_mass
<br />
Units: kg
<br />
Long name: Land ice mass
<br />
Definition: The mass of land ice (glaciers, ice caps, ice sheet and ice shelves), computed as the ice volume times density.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 17: land_ice_mass_not_displacing_sea_water
<br />
Units: kg
<br />
Long name: Land ice mass that does not displace sea water
<br />
Definition: The mass of land ice that does not displace sea water if removed, computed as the ice volume times density. It excludes ice shelves, and components of the grounded ice sheet that would not displace sea level (for example, in regions where the ice rests on a bedrock that sits below sea level)
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 18: grounded_land_ice_area
<br />
Units: m2
<br />
Long name: Area covered by grounded ice sheet
<br />
Definition: Total area of the grounded land ice, where grounded indicates that the ice rests on bedrock, and therefore excludes ice shelves.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 19: floating_ice_shelf_area
<br />
Units: m2
<br />
Long name: Area covered by floating ice shelves.
<br />
Definition: Total area of the floating ice shelves, which is the land ice component that flows over sea water.
<br />
<br />EXISTING  standard name: land_ice_area_fraction
<br />
Units: 1
<br />
Long name: Land Ice Area Fraction
<br />
Definition from cfconventions.org&lt;<a href="http://cfconventions.org">http://cfconventions.org</a>&gt;: &quot;X_area_fraction&quot; means the fraction of horizontal area occupied by X. &quot;Land ice&quot; means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 20: grounded_ice_sheet_area_fraction
<br />
Units: 1
<br />
Long name: Grounded Ice Sheet Area Fraction
<br />
Definition: Fraction of grid cell covered by grounded ice sheet, where grounded indicates that the quantity correspond to the ice sheet that flows over bedrock.
<br />
<br />Proposed standard name 21: floating_ice_sheet_area_fraction
<br />
Units: 1
<br />
Long name: Floating Ice Sheet Area Fraction
<br />
Definition: Fraction of grid cell covered by ice sheet flowing over seawater (also called ice shelf).
<br />
<br />Note land_ice_area_fraction already exist, hence the suggestion to add  grounded_ice_sheet_area_fraction and floating_ice_sheet_area_fraction: These could also use instead the existing name &quot;area_fraction&quot;, with a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable of &quot;area_type&quot; and add new entries to the area_type table (<a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/area-type-table/current/build/area-type-table.html">http://cfconventions.org/Data/area-type-table/current/build/area-type-table.html</a>). Alison suggested that this is discussed on list.
