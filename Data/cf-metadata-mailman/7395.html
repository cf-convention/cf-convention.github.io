<br />
Dear all,
<br />
<br />because of our research on AUVs we find it useful to store
<br />
information
<br />
about derivatives of the sea water velocity with respect to
<br />
all of its
<br />
spatiotemporal dimensions.
<br />
<br />Our suggestions are based on the
<br />
standard names
<br />
?northward_sea_water_velocity&quot; and
<br />
?eastward_sea_water_velocity&quot; as
<br />
vector components u and v of the sea
<br />
water velocity. We wrote the
<br />
description according to the text of the
<br />
existing standards
<br />
?eastward_derivative_of_northward_sea_ice_velocity&quot;
<br />
and
<br />
?x_derivative_of_ocean_rigid_lid_pressure&quot; as a template.
<br />
<br />We
<br />
propose the following
<br />
names:
<br />
<br />northward_derivative_of_northward_sea_water_velocity
<br />
[1/s]
<br />
<br />&quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive
<br />
when
<br />
directed eastward (negative westward). &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a
<br />
vector
<br />
component which is positive when directed northward
<br />
(negative
<br />
southward). Sea water velocity is defined as a two-dimensional
<br />
vector,
<br />
with no vertical component. &quot;component_derivative_of_X&quot;
<br />
means
<br />
derivative of X with respect to distance in the component
<br />
direction,
<br />
which may be northward, southward, eastward, westward, x or
<br />
y. The
<br />
last two indicate derivatives along the axes of the grid, in the
<br />
case
<br />
where they are not true longitude and
<br />
latitude.
<br />
northward_derivative_of_northward_sea_water_velocity means
<br />
(d/dx) of
<br />
the seawater velocity component u, as derived by ocean data
<br />
models,
<br />

<br />

<br />
means
<br />
derivative of X with respect to distance in the component

<br />
case
<br />
where they are not true longitude and
<br />
latitude.
<br />
eastward_derivative_of_northward_sea_water_velocity means
<br />
(d/dy) of
<br />
the seawater velocity component u, as derived by ocean data
<br />

<br />
constant.
<br />
<br />northward_derivative_of_eastward_sea_water_velocity
<br />
[1/s]
<br />

<br />
when
<br />
directed eastward (negative westward). &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a
<br />

<br />
component which is positive when directed northward

with no vertical component. &quot;component_derivative_of_X&quot;
<br />
means
<br />
derivative of X with respect to distance in the component
<br />

<br />
last two indicate derivatives along the axes of the grid, in the
<br />
case
<br />
where they are not true longitude and
<br />
latitude.
<br />
northward_derivative_of_eastward_sea_water_velocity means
<br />

<br />
the seawater velocity component v, as derived by ocean data

<br />
latitude.

constant.
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_acceleration [m/s?]
<br />
<br />&quot;Eastward&quot; indicates
<br />

along the axes of the grid, in the case
<br />
where they are not true
<br />
longitude and latitude.
