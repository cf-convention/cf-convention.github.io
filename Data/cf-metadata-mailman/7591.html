Hello again,
<br />
<br />Here are my suggestions for your other six height definitions (I've already made a suggestion for Hs)
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_maximum_height
<br />
Wave height is defined as the distance from a wave trough to the following wave crest. The maximum wave height is the greatest trough to crest distance measured during the observation period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_average_height
<br />
Wave height is defined as the distance from a wave trough to the following wave crest. The average wave height is the average trough to crest distance measured during the observation period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_height_of_highest_tenth
<br />
Wave height is defined as the distance from a wave trough to the following wave crest. The height of the highest tenth is defined as the average of the highest ten per cent of trough to crest distances measured during the observation period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_height_of_the_highest_crest
<br />
The crest is the highest point of a wave. Crest height is the distance between the crest and the calm sea surface. Maximum crest height is the maximum value measured during the observation period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_deepest_trough
<br />
The trough is the lowest point of a wave. Trough depth is the distance between the trough and the calm sea surface. Maximum trough depth is the maximum value measured during the observation period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_significant_height
<br />
definition of &quot;sea_surface_wave_significant_height&quot; + The primary swell wave is the most energetic wave in the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_secondary_swell_significant_height
<br />
definition of &quot;sea_surface_wave_significant_height&quot; + The secondary swell wave is the second most energetic wave in the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />
<br />Hi all,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your feedback Roy.
<br />
Here are the definitions we suggest for the 7 new parameters. They are the usual definitions in the observations world.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_significant_height
<br />
The already existing definition is &quot;Height is the vertical distance above the surface.&quot; We believe that this definition defines the &quot;sea_surface_wave_height&quot; part, but not the &quot;significant&quot; part. Could it be possible to revise it to make it more precise? We think that a more precise definition could be :&quot;Height is the vertical distance above the surface. The significant height is defined as the average height of the highest third of observed sea surface waves over a 30 minutes period.&quot;
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_maximum_height
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. The maximum height is defined as the height of the highest sea surface wave observed over a 30 minutes period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_average_height
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. The average height is defined as the average height of the sea surface waves observed over a 30 minutes period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_height_of_highest_tenth
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. The height of the highest tenth is defined as the average height of the highest tenth of observed sea surface waves over a 30 minutes period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_height_of_the_highest_crest
<br />
The crest is the vertical distance above the mean sea surface to the maximum in a wave. Height of the highest crest is the maximum value of wave crests observed over a 30 minutes period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_deepest_trough
<br />
Trough is the vertical distance below the mean sea surface to the minimum in a wave. The deepest trough is the maximum value of wave troughs observed over a 30 minutes period.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_significant_height
<br />
definition of &quot;sea_surface_wave_significant_height&quot; + The primary swell wave is the most energetic swell wave.
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_secondary_swell_significant_height
<br />
definition of &quot;sea_surface_wave_significant_height&quot; + The secondary swell wave is the second most energetic swell wave.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />

<br /><br /><br />Many thanks. I totally agree with your revised proposal for seven new Standard Names. I also congratulate you for the clarity of your proposals.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The next stage would be for you to provide revised definitions for these seven. I will also do my best to provide my comments to you for your energy, steepness and period proposals by the end of the week.

<br />
<br />Hello Roy and all,
<br />
<br />I think you are right Roy, let's look at height variables first to keep things manageable.
<br />
I'm sorry it took me a little while to reply, I wanted to first discuss things with Marta and wave modellers from Copernicus.
<br />
<br />We agree that the estimator should be included in a long_name, not in the Standard Name. So the list of names we &quot;need&quot; for height are reduced to:
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_significant_height -&gt; already exists
<br />
- sea_surface_wave_maximum_height
<br />
- sea_surface_wave_average_height
<br />
<br />We think that for the maximum_wave_height and mean_wave_height, the statistics should be included in the Standard Name and not in the cell_methods, because it is really part of the definition and not something applied afterwards to the physical parameter. Am I making sense?
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_wave_height_of_highest_tenth
<br />
- sea_surface_wave_height_of_the_highest_crest
<br />
- sea_surface_wave_deepest_trough
<br />
<br />- sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_significant_height
<br />
- sea_surface_secondary_swell_wave_significant_height
<br />
- sea_surface_wind_wave_significant_height -&gt; already exists
<br />
<br />So we would be down to 7 new Standard Names.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Elodie

<br /><br /><br />Dear Elodie,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Following my comments on Hs, here are some comments on the rest of your proposals for additional wave height Standard Names. Most of the comments follow the same theme of placing statistic derivation methods out of the Standard Name. My proposed changes will affect your definitions, but let's discuss names first to keep things manageable.
<br />
<br /><br />sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_average_height_of_highest_tenth
<br />
Use sea_surface_wave_average_height_of_highest_tenth as the Standard Name with the derivation method in the long name. If zero-upcrossing analysis is based on the method specified by Tucker and Draper then include 'Tucker-Draper' in the label.
<br />
sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_average_height
<br />
Suggest sea_surface_wave_average_height This raises the question of whether 'average' should be handled by a cell method? However, there is a precedent for the inclusion of statistics in the name already established for waves e.g. sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_average_height.
<br />
sea_surface_wave_maximum_height
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK
<br />
sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_maximum_height
<br />
Use sea_surface_wave_maximum_height and Long Name for the derivation method.
<br />
sea_surface_wave_crest_through_maximum_height
<br />
Should 'through' be 'trough'? Also, I'm not clear on exactly what this is. Is it the distance from the deepest trough to the highest crest in the analysis (i.e. the sum of   sea_surface_wave_deepest_trough and sea_surface_wave_height_of_the_highest_crest) or the greatest crest to following trough distance in the analysis. Could you clarify then I'll suggest a change to the name?
<br />
sea_surface_wave_deepest_through
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume you mean sea_surface_wave_deepest_trough, in which case OK.
<br />
sea_surface_wave_height_of_the_highest_crest
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK
<br />
sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_significant_height
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Spectral' removed from your suggestion with derivation moved to Long Name.
<br />
sea_surface_secondary_swell_wave_significant_height
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Spectral' removed from your suggestion with derivation moved to Long Name.
<br />
Your other height proposal (sea_surface_wind_wave_spectral_significant_height) is covered by the pre-existing Standard Name sea_surface_wind_wave_significant_height.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

Subject: [CF-metadata] Waves
<br />
<br />Hi all,
<br />
<br />So here are our proposals for wave variables that will be available through the European Copernicus Marine service. It's split in two &quot;categories&quot;: names for the whole spectrum and names for the partitions. I added in copy for this topic Marta de Alfonso Alonso-Munoyerro who is an expert in waves from Puertos del Estado.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole partition
<br />
-------------------------------------
<br />
<br />1. Height
<br />
<br />Significant height can be measured using different methods, so we think that the already existing definition should be more precise and that new names should be added.
<br />
<br />1.a &quot;sea_surface_significant_height&quot; (modification of definition)
<br />
unit m
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. Significant wave height can be estimated by zero upcrossing analysis and by spectral analysis. The generic significant wave height is used when the estimator is unknown.
<br />
<br />1.b &quot;sea_surface_wave_spectral_significant_height&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;unit m
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. It can be defined from spectral analysis. The wave directional spectrum can be written as a five dimensional function S(t,x,y,f,theta) where t is time, x and y are horizontal coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), f is frequency and theta is direction. S has the standard name sea_surface_wave_directional_variance_spectral_density. S can be integrated over direction to give S1= integral(S dtheta) and this quantity has the standard name sea_surface_wave_variance_spectral_density. Frequency moments, M(n) of S1 can then be calculated as follows: M(n) = integral(S1 f^n df), where f^n is f to the power of n. Spectral significant wave height is defined as 4* sqrt (M(0)) = 4 * sqrt ( integral(S1 df) )
<br />
<br />1.c &quot;sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_significant_height&quot;
<br />
unit m
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. The significant wave height is defined from zero upcrossing analysis as the average height of the highest one third waves.
<br />
<br />1.d. &quot;sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_average_height_of_highest_tenth&quot;
<br />
unit    m
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. The average height of highest tenth waves is defined from zero upcrossing analysis as the average height of the highest one tenth waves.
<br />
<br />1.e &quot;sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_average_height&quot;
<br />
unit    m
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. The average height is defined from zero upcrossing analysis as the average of wave heights.
<br />
<br />1.f &quot;sea_surface_wave_maximum_height&quot;
<br />
unit    m
<br />
&nbsp;Height is the vertical distance above the surface. Estimated maximum wave height is not measured but estimated from others parameters like significant wave height.
<br />
<br />1.h &quot;sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_maximum_height&quot;
<br />
unit    m
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. Maximum zero crossing  wave height is the measured maximum height of the waves separated by zero upcrossing analysis.
<br />
<br />1.i &quot;sea_surface_wave_crest_through_maximum_height&quot;
<br />
unit    m
<br />
Height is the vertical distance above the surface. Maximum crest trough wave height is the measured maximum height of the waves separated by crests method.
<br />
<br />1.j &quot;sea_surface_wave_deepest_through&quot;
<br />
unit    m
<br />
Trough is the vertical distance below 0 to the minimum in a wave. Depth of the deepest trough is the maximum value of wave troughs.
<br />
<br />1.k &quot;sea_surface_wave_height_of_the_highest_crest&quot;
<br />
unit    m
<br />
Crest is the vertical distance above 0 to the maximum in a wave. Height of the highest crest is the maximum value of wave crests.
<br />
<br />2. Energy
<br />
<br />2.a &quot;sea_wave_spectrum_peak_energy&quot;
<br />
unit    mms (meter*meter*second)
<br />
The wave directional spectrum can be written as a five dimensional function S(t,x,y,f,theta) where t is time, x and y are horizontal coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), f is frequency and theta is direction. S has the standard name sea_surface_wave_directional_variance_spectral_density.  S can be integrated over direction to give S1= integral(S dtheta) and this quantity has the standard name sea_surface_wave_variance_spectral_density. Wave spectrum peak energy is the maximum value of the variance spectral density (max(S1)).
<br />
<br />3. Period
<br />
<br />3.a &quot;sea_surface_wave_mean_period&quot;
<br />
unit s
<br />
&nbsp;A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Mean or averaged wave period is the average value of the wave periods and can be estimated by zero upcrossing analysis and by spectral analysis. The generic average wave period is used when the estimator is unknown.
<br />
<br />3.b &quot;sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_significant_wave_period&quot;
<br />
unit    s
<br />
A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. The significant wave period is defined from zero upcrossing analysis as the average period of the highest one third waves.
<br />
<br />3.c &quot;sea_surface_wave_zero_upcrossing_average_one_tenth_wave_period&quot;
<br />
unit    s
<br />
A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. The average period highest one tenth waves is defined from zero upcrossing analysis as the average period of the highest one tenth waves.
<br />
<br />3.d &quot;sea_surface_wave_maximum_period&quot;
<br />
unit    s
<br />
A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. The maximum wave period is defined from zero upcrossing analysis as the maximum period of the waves.
<br />
<br />3.e &quot;sea_surface_wave_period_of_highest_wave&quot;
<br />
unit    s
<br />
A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. The period of the highest wave is defined from zero upcrossing analysis as the period of the highest wave.
<br />
<br />4. Direction
<br />
<br />4.a &quot;sea_surface_wave_from_mean_direction&quot;
<br />
unit    degree
<br />
from_direction is used in the construction X_from_direction and indicates the direction from which the velocity vector of X is coming. The mean wave direction is the average direction from which waves are coming.
<br />
<br />4.b &quot;sea_surface_wave_from_direction_at_spectral_peak&quot;
<br />
unit    degree
<br />
from_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_from_direction and indicates the direction from which the velocity vector of X is coming. The spectral peak is the most energetic  wave in the total wave spectrum. The wave direction at spectral peak is the direction from which waves are coming at the spectral peak.
<br />
<br />5. Steepness
<br />
<br />5.a &quot;sea_surface_wave_maximum_steepness&quot;
<br />
unit    dimensionless
<br />
The wave steepness is defined as the ratio of the wave height divided by the wavelength. The maximum wave steepness is the maximum value.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partitions
<br />
-------------------------------------
<br />
<br />We also wish to add names for the three &quot;main&quot; variables defining waves for three partitions: the wind wave, the primary swell wave and the secondary swell wave. These three variables are
<br />
- the spectral significant height (1.b of our proposal sea_surface_wave_spectral_significant_height)
<br />
- the direction (4.b of our proposal sea_surface_wave_from_direction_at_spectral_peak)
<br />
- the period (already existing name sea_surface_wave_mean_period_from_variance_spectral_density_first_frequency_moment)
<br />
<br />So we propose for all three to replace in the name &quot;sea_surface_wave&quot; with &quot;sea_surface_wind_wave&quot;, &quot;sea_surface_primary_swell_wave&quot; and &quot;sea_surface_secondary_swell_wave&quot;. And we believe the definitions should be the definitions already existing or proposed on this email, with the addition at the end of the definition of the partition itself: &quot;The directional wave spectrum can be separated into several partitions: wind wave contribution (WW), primary swell (SW1) contribution (the most energetic swell) and secondary swell contribution (SW2).&quot;, with a bit more detail for the wind wave: &quot;Wind waves are waves on the ocean surface generated by the local wind.&quot;
<br />
<br />For example:
<br />
sea_surface_secondary_swell_wave_from_direction
<br />
unit degree
<br />
The directional wave spectrum can be separated into several partitions: wind wave contribution (WW), primary swell (SW1) contribution (the most energetic swell) and secondary swell contribution (SW2). The mean wave direction is the average direction from which waves are coming for the secondary swell wave partition.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Elodie Fernandez
