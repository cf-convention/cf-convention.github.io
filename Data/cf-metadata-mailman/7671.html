<br />
Folks,
<br />
<br />A few thoughts here:
<br />
<br />As Ute made reference, some of us in the oil spill modeling community have
<br />
had previous discussions about netcdf standards for oil spills information
<br />
-- in that case, mostly model results, but there is a lot of overlap with
<br />
field measurements as well.
<br />
<br />So I suggest that as a community we address the whole pile, rather than
<br />
adding a single new standard name.
<br />
<br />I offer up this gitHub repo as a central point for discussion:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/nc_particles">https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/nc_particles</a>
<br />
<br />or we could make a new one for standard names if we like.
<br />
<br />In the meantime:
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;I would like to propose to use a standard name like
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;mass_fraction_of_contaminant_in_sea_water&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This is a fine idea -- to have _something_ that covers a lot of use cases
<br />
in the meantime. exactly what the contaminant is, and how it was measured
<br />
can be in the long name or other meta-data.
<br />

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a parameter 'total petroleum hydrocarbons' (TPH) defined as 'A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mixture comprising all substances comprising totally of carbon and hydrogen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that may be extracted from a sample using an organic solvent. These are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presumed sourced from crude oil.'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />having one for TPH is a fine idea as well -- this is a very commonly used
<br />
convention. The &quot;presumed sourced from cure oil&quot; is a bit odd, but I
<br />
suppose, correct, if &quot;sourced&quot; in interpreted broadly :-)
<br />
<br />I also mention that in my experience of these measurements contamination of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water samples is reported in units of micrograms per litre, i.e. mass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concentration rather than mass fraction.
</em><br />
<br /><br />yeah, this is a convention that has always bugged me -- as far as I can
<br />
tell, everyone considers the two equivalent -- i.e. one milligram per liter
<br />
IS one part per million, and they are used interchangeably. I personally
<br />
call this &quot;concentration in water&quot;, and assume 1kg/liter for the water) --
<br />
I don't know that there is a way to express that equivalence in CF or
<br />
udunits, so I would suggest that the &quot;official&quot; unit be mass fraction --
<br />
it's more precise and clearly defined.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that petroleum_hydrocarbons is more specific and therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preferable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it possible to omit &quot;total&quot;, or does it have a specific meaning too and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore convey some extra information?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I've always seen &quot;total&quot; in there, usually to distinguish from more
<br />
specific measurements that capture particular classes of compounds, like
<br />
PAHs. As &quot;TPH&quot; is in really common use, I suggest we keep it.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www3.epa.gov/region1/eco/uep/tph.html">https://www3.epa.gov/region1/eco/uep/tph.html</a>
<br />
<br />Having read through the SeaOWL specification provided by Mike's link, I see
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is something totally new making a combination of fluorescence and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; backscatter measurements at different wavelengths and using the results
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a calibration algorithm to produce measurements of an analyte that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WETLabs/SeaBird describe as 'crude oil'. This is NOT the same thing as TPH
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a wet chemical measurement), although in most environments the two will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be linearly correlated. I therefore now think that it would be best to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use the terminology of the instrument manufacturer: i.e. 'crude_oil'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The use of fluorescence to measure oil in water is fraught with difficulty,
<br />
and lacking in precision -- it looks like WETLabs has done an admirable job
<br />
(speaking only from their literature, and a VERY limited understanding of
<br />
the science) of developing a tool for that purpose (rather than simply
<br />
using a CDOM tool and expecting it to work), but I seriously doubt that
<br />
they can distinguish between &quot;crude oil&quot; and petroleum-derived hydrocarbons
<br />
in general. And I doubt they'd even want to.
<br />
<br />For instance, if a refined product is spilled, that is not crude oil, but
<br />
it is PH, and I'm sure their instrument would measure it.
<br />
<br />Also, as Ute pointed out, once released into the environment, crude oil
<br />
weathers and changes, so it's no longer &quot;crude&quot; strictly speaking.
<br />
<br />I suspect the term &quot;crude oil&quot; is being used for marketing, and &quot;TPH&quot; is
<br />
what they are really trying to measure. I'm sure what they are really
<br />
trying to do is make the point that their instrument measures hydrocarbons
<br />
(maybe petroleum derived, rather than other sources of fluorescence.
<br />
<br />I can run this by folks in our group that understand all this better than
<br />
I, if there is still uncertainty
<br />
