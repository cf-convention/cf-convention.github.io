Dear Chris
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If the regions were irregular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; polygons in latitude and longitude, nv would be the number of vertices and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lat and lon bounds would trace the outline of the polygon e.g. nv=3,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lat=0,90,0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and lon=0,0,90 describes the eighth of the sphere which is bounded by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meridians at 0E and 90E and the Equator. I think, therefore, we do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; need an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; additional convention for points or polygonal regions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this seems fine for this simple example, but burying a bunch of coordinates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a complex polygon in a text string in an attribute is really not a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea -- the coordinates of a polygon should be in the array data one way or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another, rather than having to parse out attribute strings.
</em><br />
<br />To avoid confusion:
<br />
<br />I didn't suggest parsing attribute strings. The same numbers that Ben would put
<br />
in his x and y auxiliary coordinate variables for a single polygon can appear
<br />
in coordinate bounds variables according to the existing convention.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; * I suspect that geometries of this kind can be described by the ugrid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; convention <a href="http://ugrid-conventions.github.io/ugrid-conventions">http://ugrid-conventions.github.io/ugrid-conventions</a>, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; compliant with CF. Their purpose is to describe a set of connected points,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; edges or faces at which values are given,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not so sure -- UGRID is about defining a bunch of polygons that all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; share vertices, and are all of the same order (usually all triangles, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quads, or maybe hexes). if they are a mixture, you still store the full set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (say, six vertices), while marking some as unused. But it's not that well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set up for a bunch of polygons of different order.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not too bad if there are only one or two complex polygons, but it would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bit weird -- you'd have vertices and boundaries, but no faces. And you'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lose t order of the vertices (thought that could probably be added to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UGRID standard)
</em><br />
<br />OK. I didn't investigate this, but it would be good to know about it. If
<br />
ugrid can do something like this, but not all of it, maybe ugrid could be
<br />
extended. If ugrid seems too complicated for these cases, maybe a &quot;light&quot;
<br />
version of ugrid could be proposed for them. I think we should avoid having
<br />
two partially overlapping conventions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; * So far CF does not say anything about the use of netCDF-4 features (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the classic model). We have often discussed allowing them but the general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument is also made that there has to be a compelling case for providing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; new way to do something which can already be done. (Steve Hankin often made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this argument, but since he's mostly retired I'll make it now in his name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe it's time to embrace netcdf4? It's been a while! Though maybe for CF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.* -- any movement on that?
</em><br />
<br />I think, as we generally do, that we should adopt netCDF-4 features if there
<br />
is a definite need to do so. I mean something you can't do with an existing
<br />
mechanism, or which is done so much more easily with a new mechanism that it
<br />
justifies the extra effort of requiring alternatives to be programmed in
<br />
software. I'm not arguing against it in general, but I think it has to be
<br />
argued for each specific need within the convention.
<br />
<br />CF2 is not well-defined. I have to admit to being nervous about that. I am
<br />
very much opposed to an idea of &quot;starting all over again&quot; and maintaining
<br />
two conventions in parallel (since old data would continue to exist for a long
<br />
time and so the old CF would have to be supported), and I also think backwards-
<br />
incompability has to be strongly justified. So I favour step-by-step evolution.
<br />
Another idea we've discussed, which I'm comfortable with, is of defining
<br />
&quot;strict&quot; compliance to the convention, which a data-writer could optionally
<br />
adhere to. This could exclude older features we wanted to deprecate. However
<br />
this is really not the subject of the discussion - it's another thread.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the ragged array option ins fine -- though I haven't looked at vlen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arrays enough to know if they offer a compelling alternative. One issue is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the programming environments that we use to work with the data may not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have an equivalent of vlen arrays.
</em><br />
<br />That's a good point, and a reason why we have to be cautious in general about
<br />
adopting netCDF-4 features.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
