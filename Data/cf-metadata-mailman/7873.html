Dear Ben and Bert
<br />
<br />Thanks for your emails, which help me to understand the simple geometry
<br />
proposals better. Just to be clear, I'd like to repeat my first question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You explain that the need is to specify spatial coordinates with a simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; geometry for a timeSeries variable. For example, this could be for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discharge as a function of time across some line in a river (your example),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or I suppose it could be an average temperature as a function of time for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Atlantic Ocean, where you wanted to supply the polygon which drew the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outline of the basin. Have I got the idea?
</em><br />
<br />to which you replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, you have this mostly right. It?s common to have a collection of points
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (weather stations), lines (stream reaches), or polygons (hydrologic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; catchments) with an associated time series
</em><br />
<br />I was asking whether this means that for each *collection* (of points, lines or
<br />
polygons) there is a *single* timeseries. For instance, in your example of a
<br />
single geometry composed of several polygons, there is a single number for each
<br />
time. But that is not the case for weather stations; for each weather station
<br />
there is a timeseries, and at each time there is a different number (value of
<br />
temperature, precipitation or whatever) for each weather station. You also
<br />
write, &quot;The US National Weather Service?s National Water Model (NWM) ...
<br />
forecasts streamflow rates in about 2.7 million stream segments averaging 2km.&quot;
<br />
The stream network is a MultiLineString geometry, but I don't think there is
<br />
just one value of streamflow applying to the entire network at any given time;
<br />
I guess there is a different timeseries for each stream segment. But in my
<br />
example above, the Atlantic Ocean is a single polygon with a single timeseries
<br />
for its average temperature, not a different timeseries for each node. Thus I
<br />
am unclear about the dimensions of the data. In terms of your original example,
<br />
does the data have dimensions (time,geometry, where geometry=1) or (time,node)?
<br />
<br />This seems to me to be a crucial difference. In the former case the simple
<br />
geometry can be regarded as a more complex alternative to cells bounds - the
<br />
cell has a complicated geometry of nodes and lines, but it's still a single
<br />
cell. In the latter case you're providing many timeseries in an unstructured
<br />
geometry, which is what ugrid describes. Which do you have in mind?
<br />
<br />Nonetheless in both cases the geometries have to be described. I think the
<br />
difference is how we attach this description to the data or coordinates, rather
<br />
than how the description is constructed.
<br />
<br />You propose the index variable in order for the convention to be like ugrid.
<br />
However this still seems to me to be an unnecessary complexity and use of space
<br />
if you aren't going to have many shared nodes. I think the case for having
<br />
another convention, distinct from ugrid, is stronger if it is *unlike* ugrid
<br />
in this respect, and therefore simpler as well.
<br />
<br />I agree that repeating the inside/outside flag many times is wasteful. That,
<br />
coupled with your clarification that you may have several geometries, each
<br />
consisting of several elements (points, lines, polygons), means that you need,
<br />
in effect, a ragged array of ragged arrays (geometry,element,node). This is
<br />
more complicated than DSGs, but it seems to me it would be reasonably easy to
<br />
understand if your multi-geometry example
