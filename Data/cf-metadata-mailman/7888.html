A few comments, though you all seem to have this in hand :-)
<br />
<br /><br />I was asking whether this means that for each *collection* (of points,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lines or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; polygons) there is a *single* timeseries.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't get why this matters -- any number of time series could be
<br />
associated with a single &quot;entity&quot; -- just like any number of timeseries can
<br />
be associated with  given coordinates in regular old CF.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For instance, in your example of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single geometry composed of several polygons, there is a single number for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time. But that is not the case for weather stations; for each weather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; station
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a timeseries, and at each time there is a different number (value
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temperature, precipitation or whatever) for each weather station.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think it may be helpful to borrow terminology (and the data model) from
<br />
the GIS world here. IN this case, I am referencing the geoJSON spec, as I
<br />
happen to be working with that at the moment, but the basic data model is
<br />
pretty consistent.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html">http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html</a>
<br />
<br />Note that they have &quot;geometries&quot; which can be things like points, polygons,
<br />
polyllines. IIUC (and I'm no osgeo mavin) geometries represent a &quot;single&quot;
<br />
entity. Then there are &quot;Features&quot;: a Feature is essentially data associated
<br />
with a particular geometry.
<br />
<br />But note: there are &quot;Collections&quot; -- both Geometry and Feature Collections
<br />
-- that is what you use to &quot;bundle&quot; various data together.
<br />
<br />I think we may be well served by thinking in terms of mapping the GIS data
<br />
model to CF/netcdf -- for instance it would be great to be able to write a
<br />
netcdf&lt;-&gt;geoJSON converter that was lossless, AND would be fairly &quot;native&quot;
<br />
in both cases.
<br />
<br /><br />You also
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write, &quot;The US National Weather Service?s National Water Model (NWM) ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forecasts streamflow rates in about 2.7 million stream segments averaging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2km.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The stream network is a MultiLineString geometry, but I don't think there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just one value of streamflow applying to the entire network at any given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />no -- of course not. So that network (if I understand the GIS data model)
<br />
should be a Feature Collection, not all one Feature. So a whole collection
<br />
of geometries as well.
<br />
<br />The &quot;trick&quot; with this data model is that it &quot;de-vecoritizes&quot; the data.
<br />
Those of us used to working with netcdf, CF, gridded data, etc, tend to
<br />
think that you'd want to have, for instance, a vector of geometries, and
<br />
then various vectors of data associated with those geometries. whereas the
<br />
GIS data model associated data with a given geometry, and then creates
<br />
collections of those. This is kindof like the old C conundrum:
<br />
<br />Do a use a struct of arrays, or an array of structs? netcdf is very much
<br />
about  the struct of arrays approach.
<br />
<br />(though I'm still confused, maybe you can have an &quot;array&quot; of data
<br />
associated with a GeometryCollection?)
<br />
<br />as for MultiLineString -- you could associate an array of data with the
<br />
Multilinestring -- so one value per segment. But I think that violates the
<br />
intent of the data model -- you should have a GeometryCollection of
<br />
linestrings instead. and then each segment has its own geometry and you can
<br />
associate an array of data with that. (or it should be a FeatureCollection?
<br />
I'm getting confused now!
<br />
<br />I guess there is a different timeseries for each stream segment. But in my
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example above, the Atlantic Ocean is a single polygon with a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; timeseries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for its average temperature, not a different timeseries for each node.
</em><br />
<br /><br />right, so that Polygon would be a single Feature.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am unclear about the dimensions of the data. In terms of your original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does the data have dimensions (time,geometry, where geometry=1) or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (time,node)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />(time,geometry, where geometry=1)
<br />
<br />time,node would be for data associated with a FeatureCollection of Points
<br />
(or a MultiPoint).
<br />
<br />Does anyone &quot;get&quot; the GIS data model. I'm quite confused as to when you
<br />
would use:
<br />
<br />MultiPolygon
<br />
vs
<br />
GeometryCollection of Polygons
<br />
vs
<br />
FeatureCollection of Features with Polygon Geometries
<br />
<br />But I'm going t take a stab at it:
<br />
<br />MultiPolygon (and MultiLInestring, and MultiPoint) is used when you have
<br />
more than one of a particular type of geometry that are logically one thing
<br />
-- maybe an archipelago, for instance. A Polygon geometry can represent a
<br />
simple polygon, or a polygon with holes in it -- but can not represent two
<br />
separate polygons. So if you have multiple polygons that are geometrically
<br />
distinct, but logically connected, you use a MultiPolygon.
<br />
<br />I'm on shakier ground about when you want to use a GeometryCollection vs a
<br />
FeatureCollection, but I _think_ that the point of a geometrycollection is
<br />
that you can group different types of geometry -- but still want them to be
<br />
treated as a single entity.
<br />
<br />I've dealt with all this trying to jam data that fits well into netcdf into
<br />
geoJSON, or GIS_oriented systems -- it's quite hard to be efficient about
<br />
it :-) - i.e there is really no way to associate an array of data with an
<br />
array of geometries -- it sure looks like you could do it with
<br />
GeometryCollections, but the systems aren't expecting that.
<br />
<br />Of course, CF doesn't need to follow this data model, but it's a good idea
<br />
to be informed by it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nonetheless in both cases the geometries have to be described. I think the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference is how we attach this description to the data or coordinates,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than how the description is constructed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You propose the index variable in order for the convention to be like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ugrid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However this still seems to me to be an unnecessary complexity and use of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you aren't going to have many shared nodes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In the GIS data model, nodes are not shared between geometries, and you are
<br />
quite right that keeping nodes separate with geometries indexing nto it is
<br />
an added complication and would not be space-efficient.
<br />
<br />However, there is another reason to do it -- it makes it definitive that
<br />
two (or more) geometries share the exact same node, rather than them being
<br />
distinct points that happened to be at the same location (Or worse, with FP
<br />
error and all, two points that are very close)e
<br />
<br />This is actually a major limitation in the standard GIS model.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the case for having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another convention, distinct from ugrid, is stronger if it is *unlike*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ugrid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this respect, and therefore simpler as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I still think that it should be separate from UGRID -- it really is a
<br />
different use case, though they should still share whatever they can, and
<br />
it could turn out that UGRID is a special case of geometries?
