<br />
Dear Dave,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your patience as we iron out all the final details. As before, the summary of the status of all the LUMIP names can be viewed at <a href="http://cfeditor.ceda.ac.uk/proposals/1?status=active&amp;namefilter=&amp;proposerfilter=&amp;descfilter=&amp;unitfilter=&amp;yearfilter=&amp;commentfilter=LUMIP&amp;filter+and+display=Filter">http://cfeditor.ceda.ac.uk/proposals/1?status=active&amp;namefilter=&amp;proposerfilter=&amp;descfilter=&amp;unitfilter=&amp;yearfilter=&amp;commentfilter=LUMIP&amp;filter+and+display=Filter</a>.
<br />
<br />A few more of the names are now accepted for publication. Please see my notes on proposal 2 regarding m-2 in the units, and the changes I have made to units of some other names.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. surface_downward_mass_flux_of_water_due_to_irrigation (canonical_units: kg m-2 s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;Downward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atmosphere. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the phrase. &quot;Irrigation&quot; includes water used to sustain crops, trees, pastures and urban lawns.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, this is ok.  The only issue is that I get confused about whether or not m-2 should be in the units or not.  For other variables (e.g. the carbon mass flux variables listed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below), you remove the m-2 because it is implied by the term flux, but you have included it here for this variable.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you. This name is now accepted for publication in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />Regarding the units, actually m-2 should *not* be removed from any of the names because it is somehow implied. A 'flux' name should always have m-2 as part of the units, as should a 'content' name. Thank you for pointing this out - I have now corrected the units of some of the other names as you will see in my responses below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Thank you for supplying the definition. So, in full, we have:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_upward_heat_flux_due_to_anthropogenic_energy_consumption (canonical units: W m-2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;Upward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; downward). The vertical heat flux in air is the sum of all heat fluxes i.e. radiative, latent and sensible. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Anthropogenic&quot; means influenced, caused, or created by human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity. The heat flux due to anthropogenic energy consumption results from non-renewable human primary energy consumption, including energy use by vehicles, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commercial and residential buildings, industry, and power plants. Primary energy refers to energy in natural resources, fossil and non-fossil, before conversion into other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms, such as electricity.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you. This name is now accepted for publication in the standard name table.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. Following the discussion on product names, this proposal has now become:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_wood_and_agricultural_products (canonical units: kg s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface of the earth). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. Examples of &quot;wood and agricultural products&quot; are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper, cardboard, furniture, timber for construction, biofuels and food for both humans and livestock. Models that simulate land use changes have one or more pools of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbon that represent these products in order to conserve carbon and allow its eventual release into the atmosphere, for example, when the products decompose in landfill &gt; sites.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you. I note that Dave and Lena have now agreed that 'wood_and_agricultural_products' would be better expressed as 'forestry_and_agricultural_products'. That sounds fine, so I will change the name to
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_forestry_and_agricultural_products and update the definition accordingly.
<br />
<br />The units should actually be kg m-2 s-1 because &quot;content&quot; is defined as a quantity per unit area.
<br />
<br />Dave, are you happy with these changes?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For consistency with this discussion, the existing standard name carbon_content_of_products_of_anthropogenic_land_use_change will be made into an alias. The new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; version of the name will then be:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbon_content_of_wood_and_agricultural_products (kg m-2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. Examples of &quot;wood and agricultural products&quot; are paper, cardboard, furniture, timber for construction, biofuels and food for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both humans and livestock. Models that simulate land use changes have one or more pools of carbon that represent these products in order to conserve carbon and allow its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventual release into the atmosphere, for example, when the products decompose in landfill sites.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you. I will change this to carbon_content_of_forestry_and_agricultural products and update the definition accordingly.
<br />
<br />This change is accepted for publication in the standard name table.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5. Following the discussion on product names, and the discussion about anthropogenic land use or land cover change (see proposal 7 below), this proposal has now become:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mass_flux_of_carbon_into_wood_and_agricultural_products_due_to_anthropogenic_land_use_or_land_cover_change  (canonical units: kg s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Anthropogenic&quot; means influenced, caused, or created by human activity. Examples of &quot;wood and agricultural products&quot; are paper, cardboard, furniture, timber for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construction, biofuels and food for both humans and livestock. Models that simulate land use changes have one or more pools of carbon that represent these products in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to conserve carbon and allow its eventual release into the atmosphere, for example, when the products decompose in landfill sites.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you. I will change this to
<br />
carbon_mass_flux_into_forestry_and_agricultural_products_due_to_anthropogenic_land_use_or_land_cover_change  (canonical units: kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
Please note the addition of m-2 to the units because this is a flux name and I have changed the order of the words to say &quot;carbon_mass_flux&quot; instead of &quot;mass_flux_of_carbon&quot; for consistency with other names. Following discussion of proposal 7, I will add the text for anthropogenic land use change into the definition. So the full definition will be:
<br />
'In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Anthropogenic&quot; means influenced, caused, or created by human activity. Examples of &quot;forestry and agricultural products&quot; are paper, cardboard, furniture, timber for construction, biofuels and food for both humans and livestock. Models that simulate land use changes have one or more pools of carbon that represent these products in order to conserve carbon and allow its eventual release into the atmosphere, for example, when the products decompose in landfill sites. &quot;Anthropogenic land use change&quot; means human changes to land, excluding forest regrowth. It includes fires ignited by humans for the purpose of land use change and the processes of eventual disposal and decomposition of<br />
&nbsp;wood products such as paper, cardboard, furniture and timber for construction.'
<br />
<br />Dave, are you happy with these changes?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6. Thanks for clarifying. Following the discussion about anthropogenic land use or land cover change (see proposal 7 below) I have added 'anthropogenic' into this name, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we now have:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbon_mass_flux_into_soil_and_litter_due_to_anthropogenic_land_use_or_land_cover_change (kg s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Anthropogenic&quot; means influenced, caused, or created by human activity.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you. The units should by kg m-2 s-1 because this is a flux name.
<br />
<br />Also, we should add the bit about anthropogenic land use change into the definition as follows:
<br />
'In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Anthropogenic&quot; means influenced, caused, or created by human activity. &quot;Anthropogenic land use change&quot; means human changes to land, excluding forest regrowth. It includes fires ignited by humans for the purpose of land use change and the processes of eventual disposal and decomposition of wood products such as paper, cardboard, furniture and timber for construction.'
<br />
<br />Dave, are you happy with these changes.
<br />
<br />7. surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_anthropogenic_land_use_or_land_cover_change (canonical units: kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
<br />Please note the addition of m-2 to the units because this is a flux name.
<br />
<br />We need to add the bit about anthropogenic land use change into the definition as follows:
<br />
'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;Upward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Anthropogenic&quot; means influenced, caused, or created by human activity.  &quot;Anthropogenic land use change&quot; means human changes to land, excluding forest regrowth. It includes fires ignited by <br />
humans for the purpose of land use change and the processes of eventual disposal and decomposition of wood products such as paper, cardboard, furniture and timber for construction.'
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 8. gross_rate_of_increase_in_area_fraction (s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;rate of increase in area fraction&quot; is the fraction of a grid cell that transitions to a given area type per unit time, for example, as a result of land use changes. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity described by this standard name is a gross increase because it includes only land where the use transitions to the given area type and excludes land that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transitions away from that area type during the same period. The area type should be specified using a coordinate or scalar coordinate variable with standard name 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; area_type. There is also a standard name for gross_rate_of_decrease_in_area_fraction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gross_rate_of_decrease_in_area_fraction (s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;gross rate of decrease in area fraction&quot; is the fraction of a grid cell that transitions from a given area type per unit time, for example, as a result of land use changes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The quantity described by this standard name is a gross decrease because it includes only land where the use transitions away from the given area type and excludes land
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that transitions to that area type during the same period. The area type should be specified using a coordinate of scalar coordinate variable with standard name area_type. &gt; There is also a standard name for gross_rate_of_increase_in_area_fraction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does that sound better?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.  I like this suggestion.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you. Both these names are accepted for publication in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
