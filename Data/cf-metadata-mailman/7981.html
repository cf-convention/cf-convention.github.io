<br />
Dear Ben
<br />
<br />Thanks for your new thoughts. I find this intriguing but still puzzling, and I
<br />
think this means we are talking at cross-purposes. Perhaps we ought to speak on
<br />
the phone? However, here are some replies.
<br />
<br />Maybe this is a clue to our differences:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We intend for this proposal to fit in the Discrete Sampling Geometry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; timeSeries featureType. So this proposal does not contain any new mechanism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to link a time-varying data variable with a network composed of polygons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; points, and lines (a whole hydrologic system for example).
</em><br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We would never associate time-varying data with nodes or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the edges between them.
</em><br />
<br />So far, CF describes data, and provides coordinates to locate the data in space
<br />
and time (and other dimensions). I'm not really familiar with the terminology,
<br />
but I understand that this is called a &quot;coverage&quot; - that is, a data which is a
<br />
function of a domain. Your &quot;new mechanism&quot; sentence suggests that your aim is
<br />
to describe just a domain, with no data. Maybe that's why you're agnostic about
<br />
whether and how the 2.7 million stream segments are grouped. Your aim is to
<br />
describe the network alone.
<br />
<br />But if you want to link it to CF timeseries, as you say you do, this question
<br />
must has a definite answer, because a collection of timeseries is stored as a
<br />
data variable with a single dimension of time and a single dimension of space.
<br />
The latter is an index to information which locates the data e.g. a simplified
<br />
version of CF example H.2:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;station = 10 ; // measurement locations
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time = UNLIMITED ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float humidity(station,time) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humidity:standard_name = &quot;specific humidity&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humidity:coordinates = &quot;lat lon&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double time(time) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:standard_name = &quot;time&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:units = &quot;days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float lon(station) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon:standard_name = &quot;longitude&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon:units = &quot;degrees_east&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float lat(station) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat:standard_name = &quot;latitude&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat:units = &quot;degrees_north&quot; ;
<br />
<br />Here the the data is located at 10 (lon,lat) points. In the streamflow example
<br />
I guess that each of the 2.7M stream segments has a timeseries of flow rates -
<br />
is that right? That means we have to replace the points with linestrings (which
<br />
I think is essentially the same as polylines, isn't it?), one for each stream
<br />
segment. There must be exactly the same number of linestrings as there are
<br />
timeseries. We need something like:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;station = 2700000; // stream segments
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time = UNLIMITED;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float flow(station,time) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow:units=&quot;m3 s-1&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double time(time) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:standard_name = &quot;time&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:units = &quot;days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOMETHING(station) // to describe the geometry of each stream segment
<br />
<br />Your proposal is about the SOMETHING, but not how it links to the data. Is
<br />
that right? You would like to have SOMETHING alone in the file, just to
<br />
describe the network itself. CF doesn't do this at present (domain without
<br />
data), but it's been discussed before, and if we agree a CF convention for
<br />
SOMETHING, it could also be linked to the timeseries data variables.
<br />
<br />Taking your previous comments into account (I'll come back to them below), as
<br />
a modified version of what I suggested before, here's a possible way to handle
<br />
this case, for a small number (3) of linestrings:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;station = 3; // stream segments
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time = UNLIMITED;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;node = 9; // = 2 + 4 + 3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float flow(station,time) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow:units=&quot;m3 s-1&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow:topology=&quot;SOMETHING&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double time(time) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:standard_name = &quot;time&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:units = &quot;days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int SOMETHING(station); // number of nodes for each linestring
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOMETHING:node_coordinates=&quot;lon lat&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOMETHING:geometry_type=&quot;linestring&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float lon(node) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon:standard_name = &quot;longitude&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon:units = &quot;degrees_east&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float lat(node) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat:standard_name = &quot;latitude&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat:units = &quot;degrees_north&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;data:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOMETHING=2, 4, 3;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon=0, 1,  0, -1, -2, -3,  2, 3, 4;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat=51, 52,  51, 50, 50, 49,  55, 55, 56;
<br />
<br />The timeseries flow(0,*) is for the 2-point line from (0,51) to (1,52), and
<br />
flow(1,*) is for the 4-point line (0,51) -&gt; (-1,50) -&gt; (-2,50) -&gt; (-3,49).
<br />
Timeseries of data on polygons (one timeseries for each polygon) would be done
<br />
in the same way, with geometry_type=&quot;polygon&quot;. The topology attribute of the
<br />
data variable provides a link to the SOMETHING variable, which specifies how
<br />
the nodes are connected to make the linestring or polygon for each timeseries.
<br />
I use the attribute names &quot;topology&quot; and &quot;node_coordinates&quot; to be reminiscent
<br />
of ugrid.  The SOMETHING variable could exist in a file without data variables
<br />
to describe the linestrings alone.
<br />
<br />With linestrings and polygons, the geometry of each timeseries has a single
<br />
part (one linestring or one polygon), so the SOMETHING variable is used to
<br />
specify the number of nodes for each geometry.  The example we have been
<br />
discussing in previous emails is the more complicated one of multipolygons. We
<br />
need to be able to do this in CF if there are real use-cases where each data
<br />
value applies to a *set* of polygons. I can imagine this is the case. For
<br />
example, some of the cantons of Switzerland are composed of several
<br />
non-contiguous territories, and the US state of Michigan is made of two
<br />
non-contiguous territories, and you might have one number that applied to
<br />
Michigan as a whole, or Canton Fribourg as a whole. So, for example, we could
<br />
store three timeseries, each applying to a collection of polygons, like this:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;station = 3; // collections of polygons
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time = UNLIMITED;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;node = 24; // = 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float flow(station,time) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow:units=&quot;m3 s-1&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow:topology=&quot;SOMETHING&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double time(time) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:standard_name = &quot;time&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:units = &quot;days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int SOMETHING(station); // number of polygons in each collection
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOMETHING:node_coordinates=&quot;lon lat&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOMETHING:geometry_type=&quot;multipolygon&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOMETHING:nodes=4, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3; // number of nodes in each polygon
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float lon(node) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon:standard_name = &quot;longitude&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon:units = &quot;degrees_east&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float lat(node) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat:standard_name = &quot;latitude&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat:units = &quot;degrees_north&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;data:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOMETHING=3, 2, 2; // number of polygons in each collection
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon=0, 20, 20, 0, ... // first polygon, etc. ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat=0, 0, 20, 20, ...
<br />
<br />In this arrangement, the SOMETHING variable says how many parts each geometry
<br />
has, and its nodes attribute says how many nodes there in each part. Thus I
<br />
have combined the two variables I suggested last time (number_of_parts and
<br />
number_of_nodes) into SOMETHING.
<br />
<br />These simple geometries can be regarded as a more complex alternative to cells
<br />
bounds - each timeseries has a complicated geometry of nodes and lines, but
<br />
logically it's still a single &quot;cell&quot;. For the sake of applications which can
<br />
read CF but don't understand simple geometries, it might be a good idea in
<br />
addition to provide a &quot;representative&quot; location for each timeseries, as
<br />
representive_lat(station) and representative_lon(station), which could for
<br />
instance be the mean of the node coordinates for each geometry. That would
<br />
allow a map to be drawn by which showed where the data is approximately
<br />
located, without its shape.
<br />
<br />I wrote
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You propose the index variable in order for the convention to be like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ugrid. However this still seems to me to be an unnecessary complexity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use of space if you aren?t going to have many shared nodes.
</em><br />
and you replied
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sharing nodes should be possible within the spec in our opinion. There may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be overhead for some dataset encodings, but if one is willing to sacrifice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational time when writing complex geometric datasets with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shared-node-topology, considerable disk space and memory may be saved.
</em><br />
and Chris said
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is another reason to do it ? it makes it definitive that two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or more) geometries share the exact same node, rather than them being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinct points that happened to be at the same location (Or worse, with FP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; error and all, two points that are very close)
</em><br />
<br />To be frank, I'm not convinced by either argument. Regarding the first, in your
<br />
example you don't reuse any points at all. Can you give an example where there
<br />
is a lot of reuse? Regarding the second, I agree that it is a nuisance and
<br />
unreliable to have to make comparisons with tolerance between floating-point
<br />
numbers to determine equality. However, when you write a file, I suppose you
<br />
can and would write exactly the same numbers for the coordinates of a node if
<br />
it appears several times, wouldn't you? Thus the coincidence of nodes can be
<br />
tested by *exact* equality of coordinates - no tolerance needed.
<br />
<br />In my example above, I assumed the polygons have no holes in them, so I've
<br />
omitted the inside/outside information. If needed, this information could also
<br />
be an attribute e.g. SOMETHING:inout=&quot;OIIIOOOOIOO&quot;, with as many elements as
<br />
there are polygons in total. Thinking again about it, I wonder whether this
<br />
information is really needed. If you draw all the polygons, isn't it apparent
<br />
which ones are inside anyway? When would you use this information?
<br />
<br />My scheme avoids the use of break values, which you're not very keen on your-
<br />
selves, it sounds like. A disadvantage that break values have is that they
<br />
make the number of nodes and the length of the vectors different, so you need
<br />
extra netCDF dimensions which cannot be logically related (since netCDF doesn't
<br />
support arithmetic with dimensions).
<br />
<br />You wrote
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    - The nice thing about the coordinate index approach is that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    approach basically works for all geometry types. In your example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    number_of_parts and inout are only present for multi-geometries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    (multipolygons).
</em><br />
I hope my new version looks better to you. Because it's got only one layer
<br />
now, it's always the same structure. Yes, there is extra information for the
<br />
multi-geometries, because they're more complex, but that can be stored in the
<br />
same structure using optional attribute.
<br />
<br />You wrote &gt; - It is more difficult to extract a single geometry using this
<br />
approach.  It's not hard, though, and the same comment would apply to the CF
<br />
contiguous ragged array representation. To find the first part of multipolygon
<br />
i, you sum the number of parts for multipolygons 1 to i-1 - call this sum j
<br />
(j=0 if i=0). The first part of multipolygon i is polygon j+1. You then sum the
<br />
number of nodes for polygons 1 to j - call this sum k (k=0 if i=0). The first
<br />
node of multipolygon i is k+1.
<br />
<br />I look forward to hearing your and others' thoughts. As I said, we could
<br />
arrange to talk if that would be more efficient.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
