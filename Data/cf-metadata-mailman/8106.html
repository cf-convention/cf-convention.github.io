<br />
Dear CF-Meta Mailinglist,
<br />
<br />I would like to propose new sea salt related standard names (section C) 
<br />
and modifications/corrections of variable names and descriptions 
<br />
(sections A and B) of existing sea salt standard names. I have 
<br />
propositions for further nitrogen-related standard names, which I will 
<br />
send in a second e-mail to divide both proposition.
<br />
<br /><br />~~ Section A ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
I would like to propose to modify the following two standard names:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) from  mass_fraction_of_pm10_sea_salt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to  mass_fraction_of_pm10_seasalt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) from  mass_fraction_of_pm2p5_sea_salt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to  mass_fraction_of_pm2p5_seasalt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
<br />Reason: All other existing standard names dealing with sea salt write it 
<br />
as &quot;seasalt&quot; but not as &quot;sea_salt&quot;. To be consistent we should rename 
<br />
these two standard names.
<br />
<br /><br />~~ Section B ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
Additionally, I would like to propose to replace the last scentence of 
<br />
the descriptions of these two standard names:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) from: &quot;Pm10 aerosol&quot; is an air pollutant with an aerodynamic 
<br />
diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to: &quot;Pm10 aerosol&quot; denotes atmospheric particulate compounds with 
<br />
an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) from: &quot;Pm2p5 aerosol&quot; is an air pollutant with an aerodynamic 
<br />
diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to: &quot;Pm2p5 aerosol&quot; denotes atmospheric particulate compounds with 
<br />
an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers.
<br />
<br />Reason: The default description for atmospheric particluate compounds is 
<br />
written for particles considered as pollutants (Sulfate, Nitrate, ...). 
<br />
Sea salt particles are not considered as air pollutants.
<br />
<br /><br />~~ Section C ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
Finally, I would like to propose the following new standard names (the 
<br />
descriptions and units follow in the end):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) mass_concentration_of_pm10_seasalt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) 
<br />
mass_concentration_of_pm2p5_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;3) mass_concentration_of_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;4) mass_fraction_of_pm10_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;5) mass_fraction_of_pm2p5_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;6) atmosphere_mass_content_of_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;7) mass_fraction_of_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;8) 
<br />
mass_concentration_of_pm10_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;9) 
<br />
mass_concentration_of_pm2p5_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
10) mass_concentration_of_chloride_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
11) mass_fraction_of_chloride_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air
<br />
12) mole_concentration_of_chloride_in_air
<br />
<br />Reason for (1) and (2): These standard names exist already as 
<br />
&quot;mass_fraction&quot; but not as &quot;mass_concentration&quot;. However, the total mass 
<br />
(which we need to calculate the mass fraction) is not always known. 
<br />
Therefore, the mass_fraction might not be applicable in some situations.
<br />
<br />Reason for (3) to (9): The mass of &quot;seasalt_dry_aerosol_particles&quot; is 
<br />
ambiguous. Providing the mass of &quot;seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles&quot; 
<br />
is less ambiguous. At the time of emission, sea salt particles consist 
<br />
of Chloride, Sulfate, Sodium, and further cations with mass fractions 
<br />
each below 4%. When the sea salt ages and acids as nitric and sulfuric 
<br />
acid condense/form on the wet sea salt particles, chloride exporates as 
<br />
HCl (hydrochloric acid). Thus, the mass of the original sea salt ions 
<br />
decreases during aging. In the past, some chemistry transport models 
<br />
considered sea salt particles as one bulk species, which is no affected 
<br />
by this chloride displacement. Maybe some models still consider it as 
<br />
one. When sea salt is measured, commonly sodium and sometimes magnesium 
<br />
are considered as sea salt tracers, from which the original sea salt 
<br />
concentration is calculated. The same states for several modern 
<br />
chemistry transport models with speciated sea salt. Because atmospheric 
<br />
sea salt concentrations are commonly calculated on the base of cations 
<br />
(mainly sodium) and because these concentrations do not decrease, it 
<br />
might be better provide sea salt cation data instead of total sea salt 
<br />
data. It should be noted in a comment which species (which cations) are 
<br />
included and which mass ratios they have (see my suggestion for the 
<br />
description).
<br />
<br />Reasons for (10) to (12): Currently, standard names only exist for some 
<br />
[cation]-chloride ion-compounds but not for chloride individually. When 
<br />
considering aged sea salt it might be intesting to have the chloride 
<br />
concentrations available.
<br />
<br /><br />Regards,
<br />
Daniel
