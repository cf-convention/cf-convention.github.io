Dear CF-Meta Mailinglist,
<br />
<br />As mentioned in the previous e-mail I would like to propose further 
<br />
nitrogen-related standard names and two corrections. The full 
<br />
definitions are attached in the end of this e-mail and as csv file.
<br />
<br /><br />In the last CF standard name update the two names
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_due_to_dry_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition
<br />
<br />were added.
<br />
<br />I realized that I made a typo in the descriptions. &quot;nitrage&quot; needs to be 
<br />
changed to &quot;nitrate&quot; in the description of both standard names.
<br />
<br /><br />Based on these two names, I propose the following new standard names:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 1) 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 2) 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_due_to_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 3) 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_dry_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 4) 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_due_to_dry_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 5) 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 6) 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 7) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_due_to_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 8) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 9) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_due_to_dry_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_dry_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition
<br />
<br />There exists already a variable called
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_noy_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_dry_deposition
<br />
<br />which is similar to the proposed &quot;oxidized_nitrogen&quot; standard names. 
<br />
However, &quot;noy&quot; commonly denotes gaseous species whereas 
<br />
&quot;oxidized_nitrogen&quot; denotes gaseous and particulate species.
<br />
<br />Reason for (1) to (6): For marine ecosystem modelling, reduced and 
<br />
oxizied nitrogen compounds need to be distinguished. Atmospheric 
<br />
deposition is one source for marine nitrogen compounds.
<br />
<br />Reason for (7) to (12): Consistency. New names (1) to (6) are for the 
<br />
output files of chemistry transport models, whereas (7) to (12) are for 
<br />
input files of marine biogeochemical models.
<br />
<br /><br />Cheers,
<br />
Daniel

<br />
&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; 
<br />

atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are 
<br />
used. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The 
<br />

<br />
means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which 
<br />
together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.
