Dear Roy and Beate,
<br />
<br />Thank you both for your replies (and for educating me about sea water partial pressures!)
<br />
<br />The two new names are accepted as proposed:
<br />
<br />partial_pressure_of_carbon_dioxide_in_sea_water (Pa)
<br />
'The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. The partial pressure of a gaseous constituent of air is the pressure which it alone would exert with unchanged temperature and number of moles per unit volume. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2.'
<br />
<br />partial_pressure_of_methane_in_sea_water (Pa)
<br />
'The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. The partial pressure of a gaseous constituent of air is the pressure which it alone would exert with unchanged temperature and number of moles per unit volume. The chemical formula for methane is CH4.'
<br />
<br />These will be added at the next update of the standard name table, scheduled for 24th April.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<br />Hi Alison,
<br />
<br />The 'in equilibrium' in pCO2 definition refers to the air in the analytical equipment and so has nothing to do with air-sea interface equilibrium. pCO2 is measured by using something like a shower-head or a column full of marbles to equilibrate the water sample with a stream of air that is then passed into a gas analyser. Consequently, the Standard Name makes no statement about the depth from which the water was taken.?The same would apply to methane.
<br />
<br />Whilst it is usual to measure pCO2 in surface waters, I have come across measurements on water bottle samples collected at depth.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

Dear Beate,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your proposals.
<br />
<br />As you have pointed out, we have an existing name 'surface_partial_pressure_of_carbon_dioxide_in_sea_water'. I completely agree that we should remove the sentence
<br />
' &quot;Water&quot; means water in all phases, including frozen i.e. ice and snow' from the definition as it really isn't necessary for this name. I will make that change in the April update to the standard name table.
<br />
<br />The definition of the existing name includes the sentence 'The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium' so clearly this is talking about equilibrium of partial pressures across the air-sea interface, i.e. at the surface. For the proposed name partial_pressure_of_carbon_dioxide_in_sea_water do you mean partial pressures at some arbitrary depth below the sea surface, even if these are not actually in physical contact with the surface itself? If so, then I agree we do need a new name.
<br />
<br />For the methane name I would ask the same question. Certainly we can introduce a methane partial pressure name, but I'd like to understand whether it's at the surface or at some arbitrary depth.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<br />
<br />Dear all and especially the cf-metadata crew,
<br />
<br />My colleagues and I apply for an expansion of the table of chemical species (<a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/docs/guidelines.html#id2799094">http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/docs/guidelines.html#id2799094</a>): methane.
<br />
<br />We apply to include partial_pressure_of_methane_in_sea_water (units: Pa)
<br />
with following description:
<br />
The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. The partial pressure of a gaseous constituent of air is the pressure which it alone would exert with unchanged temperature and number of moles per unit volume.
<br />
<br />The description of 'surface_partial_pressure_of_carbon_dioxide_in_sea_water' includes the sentence
<br />
&quot;Water&quot; means water in all phases, including frozen i.e. ice and snow. 
<br />
which does not fit in this context - perhaps is an update possible here.
<br />
<br />We apply to include the additional standard_name partial_pressure_of_carbon_dioxide_in_sea_water (units: Pa)
<br />
with the description
<br />
The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. The partial pressure of a gaseous constituent of air is the pressure which it alone would exert with unchanged temperature and number of moles per unit volume.
<br />
<br />The reason for this applications is the conversion of our measurement data to cf-conform netCDF.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance for your help,
