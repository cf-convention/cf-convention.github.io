<br />
Dear all,
<br />
<br />I would like to propose a set of new standard names for atmospheric sea 
<br />
salt concentrations and for nitrogen deposition. I suggested them 
<br />
already in March - this is some kind of a reminder.
<br />
<br />The suggested names are numbered and the reasons for suggesting these 
<br />
names are given below the list. The full descriptions are attached in 
<br />
the end of this e-mail.
<br />
<br />suggested name, unit:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 1) mass_concentration_of_pm10_seasalt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air, 
<br />
kg m-3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 2)

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;( 3) 
<br />
mass_concentration_of_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air, kg m-3
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 5) mass_fraction_of_pm2p5_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air, 1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;( 6) atmosphere_mass_content_of_seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles,

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(16) 
<br />

<br />
kg m-2 s-1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(17) 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition, 
<br />
kg m-2 s-1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(18) 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition, 
<br />
kg m-2 s-1
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(19) 
<br />

<br />
mol m-2 s-1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(20) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_deposition, 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(21) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_due_to_dry_deposition, 
<br />
mol m-2 s-1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(22) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_dry_deposition, 
<br />
mol m-2 s-1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(23) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition, 
<br />
mol m-2 s-1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(24) 
<br />
tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition, 
<br />
mol m-2 s-1
<br />
<br /><br />Reason for (1) and (2): These standard names exist already as 
<br />
&quot;mass_fraction&quot; but not as &quot;mass_concentration&quot;. However, the total mass 
<br />
(which we need to calculate the mass fraction) is not always known. 
<br />
Therefore, the mass_fraction might not be applicable in some situations.
<br />
<br />Reason for (3) to (9): The mass of &quot;seasalt_dry_aerosol_particles&quot; is 
<br />
ambiguous. Providing the mass of &quot;seasalt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles&quot; 
<br />
is less ambiguous. At the time of emission, sea salt particles consist 
<br />
of Chloride, Sulfate, Sodium, and further cations with mass fractions 
<br />
each below 4%. When the sea salt ages and acids as nitric and sulfuric 
<br />
acid condense/form on the wet sea salt particles, chloride exporates as 
<br />
HCl (hydrochloric acid). Thus, the mass of the original sea salt ions 
<br />
decreases during aging. In the past, some chemistry transport models 
<br />
considered sea salt particles as one bulk species, which is no affected 
<br />
by this chloride displacement. Maybe some models still consider it as 
<br />
one. When sea salt is measured, commonly sodium and sometimes magnesium 
<br />
are considered as sea salt tracers, from which the original sea salt 
<br />
concentration is calculated. The same states for several modern 
<br />
chemistry transport models with speciated sea salt. Because atmospheric 
<br />
sea salt concentrations are commonly calculated on the base of cations 
<br />
(mainly sodium) and because these concentrations do not decrease, it 
<br />
might be better provide sea salt cation data instead of total sea salt 
<br />
data. It should be noted in a comment which species (which cations) are 
<br />
included and which mass ratios they have (see my suggestion for the 
<br />
description).
<br />
<br />Reasons for (10) to (12): Currently, standard names only exist for some 
<br />
[cation]-chloride ion-compounds but not for chloride individually. When 
<br />
considering aged sea salt it might be intesting to have the chloride 
<br />
concentrations available.
<br />
<br />Reason for (13) to (18): For marine ecosystem modelling, reduced and 
<br />
oxizied nitrogen compounds need to be distinguished. Atmospheric 
<br />
deposition is one source for marine nitrogen compounds.
<br />
<br />Reason for (19) to (24): Consistency. New names (13) to (18) are for the 
<br />
output files of chemistry transport models, whereas (19) to (24) are for 
<br />
input files of marine biogeochemical models.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot;

of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the 
<br />

used. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The

together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.
