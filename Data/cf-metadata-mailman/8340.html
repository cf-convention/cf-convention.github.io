Dear Alison,
<br />
<br />Thank you very much for taking your time to send the detailed reply to 
<br />
my proposal. I agree with most of the suggested improvements.
<br />
<br /><br />I agree with you that 'sea_salt' is more appropriate than 'seasalt'. 
<br />
Feel free to change all proposed sea salt standard names to 'sea_salt'.
<br />
<br /><br />Writing '*_sea_salt_dry_aerosol_particles_expressed_as_cations_*' for 
<br />
the sea salt cation standard names is fine.
<br />
<br /><br />mass_concentration_of_chloride_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air:
<br />
mass_fraction_of_chloride_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; The names you are suggesting seem to refer to all chloride aerosol in 
</em><br />
air,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; regardless of whether it originated as sea salt. Is that the correct 
</em><br />
interpretation?
<br />
<br />Yes, that is the correct interpretation.
<br />
<br />I would suggest to keep '_chloride_dry_aerosol_particles_' instead of 
<br />
changing it to '_dry_aerosol_particles_expressed_as_chloride_'. The 
<br />
formulation '_A_expressed_as_B_' seems to appropriate in situations, in 
<br />
which (a) B is a reasonable metric for A and (b) B is an element of 
<br />
which A consists:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- '...sulfate...expressed_as_sulfur...' or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- '...organic_matter...expressed_as_carbon...' .
<br />
<br />The particulate mass concentrations (and fractions) of nitrate and 
<br />
ammonium are denoted as '_nitrate/ammonium_dry_aerosol_particles_'. 
<br />
Although nitrate and ammonium are aerosols that consist of more than one 
<br />
atom, the naming convention for other ions, such as chloride, should be 
<br />
consistent.
<br />
<br /><br />mole_concentration_of_chloride_in_air :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I assume the intention of this name is to refer to all chloride 
</em><br />
compounds
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; in air, whether aerosol or gaseous. Is that correct? Does chloride occur
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; on its own as a radical or ion in the atmosphere? If so, is it also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; included in this quantity?
</em><br />
<br />I am not quite sure why I suggested this standard name. Probably, I just 
<br />
wanted to add this standard name for the sake of completeness ... . As 
<br />
you say it is ambiguous and I do not see any application of this 
<br />
standard name (anymore). Therefore, please drop this suggestion.
<br />
<br /><br />tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_*_nitrogen_due_to_deposition:
<br />
<br />Regarding the nitrogen deposition I agree with you that the proposed 
<br />
names are ambiguous. The mass of only the nitrogen contained in the 
<br />
various species should be described by the standard name. Therefore, 
<br />
please add your first suggestion to standard name list (the same for all 
<br />
subsequent nitrogen deposition standard names):
<br />
<br />tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_oxidized_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Obviously the precise wording of the definition would depend on which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; syntax we choose, but in either case I would include the following
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; sentence : ' &quot;Oxidized nitrogen compounds&quot; means all chemical species
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; containing nitrogen atoms with an oxidation state greater than zero'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; before listing the most common species.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. Please add the sentence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; We recently added three nitrogen_deposition names that you proposed:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_due_to_deposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_due_to_dry_deposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_due_to_wet_deposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; in which the definitions say '...'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I realise now that these names (and definitions) suffer from the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; ambiguity as the current proposal. Neither the names nor the definitions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; really make clear whether we are talking about the mass of the nitrogen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; in the compounds or the total mass of the compounds. Whatever the 
</em><br />
outcome
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; of the current discussion, we should update the three existing names to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; be consistent.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. Please update them accordingly.
<br />
<br /><br />tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_*_nitrogen_due_to_deposition:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; As with the atmosphere mass content names, my question is: does the name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; mean moles of nitrogen contained in the compounds, or moles of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; compounds? (I appreciate that they might be the same number if each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; molecule of the compound contains one nitrogen atom, but that won't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; necessarily always be the case. For example, some of the oxidised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; nitrogen species contain more than one atom of N).
</em><br />
<br />I didn't consider that situation. Please use your first suggestion for 
<br />
this standard name and the subsequent standard names:
<br />
<br />tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_reduced_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition
<br />
<br /><br />Best wishes,
<br />
Daniel

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Daniel,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for (re)proposing your names.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First a couple of general points that are relevant to many of your sea salt names.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In your original posting in March (<a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2017/059293.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2017/059293.html</a>) you pointed out that there are two existing names, mass_fraction_of_pm10_sea_salt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air and mass_fraction_of_pm2p5_sea_salt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air, which refer to 'sea_salt' while all other salt aerosol names say 'seasalt', i.e. no underscore. Your suggestion was to make these two names consistent with the rest by changing them to also say 'seasalt'. I completely agree that the names should be consistent. However, I think we should change all the names to say 'sea_salt'. This is a little more work because it requires making aliases for sixteen names instead of two but a quick internet search for the terms 'sea salt' and 'seasalt' leads me to think the first one is more widely used in a scientific context. IPCC reports seem to use two separate words, e.g,<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment.../WG1AR5_Index_FINAL.pdf">https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment.../WG1AR5_Index_FINAL.pdf</a>  and<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment.../ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-i.p">https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment.../ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-i.p</a></em><br />
df. The AMS glossary<a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org">http://glossary.ametsoc.org</a>  uses variously 'sea salt' and 'sea-salt' but not 'seasalt'. Also, in CF standard names we refer to 'sea_water', not 'seawater', so in terms of achieving overall consistency I think 'sea_salt' is the better option and I propose we standardize on that. Unless there are any objections to this change I will create the sixteen aliases at the next update of the standard name table, planned for 26th June. In commenting on your individual proposals I have also taken the liberty of changing 'seasalt' to 'sea_salt' throughout - I hope that's okay.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You also made the point that where we refer to aerosols of a particular size range, such as pm1, pm2p5 and pm10, the definitions currently describe them as 'air pollutants' but this is not always true, particularly in the case of sea salt which is a naturally occurring aerosol. You suggested that we change this to say, for example, ' &quot;Pm2p5 aerosol&quot; means atmospheric particulate compounds with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers.' I agree that this is an improved definition that can be applied to existing names as well as your proposals - thank you. I will modify the existing definitions in the June update and I agree we should use this wording for your proposals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please see below for my comments on the individual proposals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. mass_concentration_of_pm10_sea_salt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air (kg m-3)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction &quot;mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. Aerosol particles take up ambient water (a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. &quot;Dry aerosol particles&quot; means aerosol particles without any water uptake. &quot;Pm10 aerosol&quot; is an air pollutant with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometers.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The name, units and definition all look fine. If we can agree on 'sea_salt' this name can be accepted for publication in the standard name table.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. mass_concentration_of_pm2p5_sea_salt_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air (kg m-3)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction &quot;mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. mass_concentration_of_sea_salt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air (kg m-3)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for your detailed explanation of why it is important to have standard names for sea_salt_cation mass as well as simply sea_salt. In standard names we use the phrase 'expressed_as' when talking about the mass of a chemical constituent of a species, for example, atmosphere_mass_content_of_nox_expressed_as_nitrogen means the mass of the nitrogen contained in the nox. There are very many similar examples (over 100) currently in the standard name table. I think it would be consistent to take the same approach for your cation names. Your third proposal would then become:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mass_concentration_of_sea_salt_dry_aerosol_particles_expressed_as_cations_in_air (kg m-3)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Based on your definition and our usual wording for 'expressed_as' names, the definition for this name would then be:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ''Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. Aerosol particles take up ambient water (a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. &quot;Dry aerosol particles&quot; means aerosol particles without any water uptake. The phrase &quot;sea_salt_cation&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe collectively the gro</em><br />
up of cationic species that occur in sea salt. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Sea salt cations are mainly sodium (Na+), but also include potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+), calcium (Ca2+) and rarer cations. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the ions represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.'
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We need to take the same approach with all the cation names, and indeed the chloride names, so if we can agree this one I think we can also go ahead and agree proposals 4 - 9.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. mass_fraction_of_pm10_sea_salt_cation_dry_aerosol_particles_in_air (1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Mass fraction is used in the construction &quot;mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As with the atmosphere mass content names, my question is: does the name mean moles of nitrogen contained in the compounds, or moles of the compounds?

For example, some of the oxidised nitrogen species contain more than one atom of N).
