<br />
Dear List,
<br />
<br />I would like to propose 10 new standard names for cyanobacteria and 
<br />
flagellates (five each). Similar names exist already for diatoms. The 
<br />
descriptions are copied except for the species-specific part. There is 
<br />
no urgency in processing this proposal but it produces considerably less 
<br />
work than my other one.
<br />
<br />We only need six of them (three per species). But, by suggesting these 
<br />
ten names, each diatom standard name has a corresponding cyanobacteria 
<br />
and flagellate name.
<br />
<br />The standard names are:
<br />
<br />mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_chlorophyll_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
mole_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
mole_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_chlorophyll_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
mole_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
mole_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Please find the descriptions and units further below in this email.
<br />
<br />Further I would like to propose two minor and one major changes in the 
<br />
descriptions of the existing diatom standard names. I will describe the 
<br />
change, print first the old description, and then print the new description.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Daniel

<br />NEW NAMES
<br />
<br />mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the 
<br />
construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material 
<br />
constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a 
<br />
single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 
<br />
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the 
<br />
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. 
<br />
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated 
<br />
solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other 
<br />
chemical constituents of A. Cyanobacteria in this context are 
<br />
dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs), which perform photosynthesis 
<br />
and produce oxygen.

<br />
<br /><br />mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_chlorophyll_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the 
<br />
construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material 
<br />
constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be 
<br />
described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 
<br />
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the 
<br />
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. 
<br />
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated 
<br />
solely with respect to the B containedin A, neglecting all other 
<br />
chemical constituents of A. Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in 
<br />
most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for 
<br />
photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of 
<br />
chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical 
<br />
formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose 
<br />
structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain 
<br />
between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Cyanobacteria in this context are 
<br />
dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs), which perform photosynthesis 
<br />
and produce oxygen.

which have in common whip-like appendages (flagella) that they use for 
<br />
their locomotion. Flagellates are a diverse group of organisms, some are 
<br />
photoautotrophs, many are mixotrophs. In most models, flagellates are 
<br />
considered small (smaller than diatoms) and photoautotrophic. A comment

should indicate whether this variable describes all flagellates or only

the photoautotrophic flagellates.
