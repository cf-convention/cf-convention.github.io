Dear Chris,
<br />
<br />Many thanks for looking through the C4MIP names again and providing the additional explanations. Apologies for taking a while to reply - some of these required careful thought!
<br />
<br />I've taken many of the comments from your Word document and incorporated them into the names and/or definitions. I've accepted quite a number of the names (18) where we seem to have reached agreement and we're making good progress on the rest. Please let me know what you think. We still need a bit of discussion about proposals 11, 15, 16, 24, 27 and 28; there are a few others that just need to be checked before I can formally accept them.

1. wood_debris_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. &quot;Wood debris&quot; means dead organic matter composed of coarse wood. It is distinct from fine litter. The precise distinction between &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;coarse&quot; is model dependent. The sum of the quantities with standard names wood_debris_mass_content_of_nitrogen, surface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen and subsurface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen is the total nitrogen mass content of dead plant material.'
<br />
<br />To maintain consistent syntax I think we should make an alias for the existing carbon name so that wood_debris_carbon_content becomes wood_debris_mass_content_of_carbon. This is also consistent with the creation of aliases  for the existing surface and subsurface litter carbon names (see the recent discussion thread starting here: <a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2018/059871.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2018/059871.html</a>)

' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. It is distinct from coarse wood debris. &quot;Surface litter&quot; means the part of the litter resting above the soil surface.

3. subsurface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. It is distinct from coarse wood debris. &quot;Subsurface litter&quot; means the part of the litter mixed within the soil below the surface.

<br />
<br />Okay?
<br />
<br />(nStem)
<br />
4. stem_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2) 
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The stem of a plant is the axis that bears buds and shoots with leaves and, at its basal end, roots. Its function is to carry water and nutrients. Examples include the stalk of a plant or the main trunk of a tree.'
<br />
<br />I constructed this definition of 'stem' from a combination of those given at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/stem-plant">https://www.britannica.com/science/stem-plant</a> and <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-plant-stem-function-types-parts.html">https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-plant-stem-function-types-parts.html</a>.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, we mean living biomass and not dead wood (covered in nLitterCwd above). Hence we prefer Stem to Wood for this reason (as per carbon

<br />I think for consistency with all the other nitrogen and carbon plant mass content names that we should say mass, rather than biomass, in this one. I've adopted your use of 'stem' instead of 'wood'. For consistency, I think we should also make an alias for the existing carbon name so that wood_carbon_content becomes stem_mass_content_of_carbon.

<br />I haven't added this bit into the standard name definitions in proposals 4 - 7 because the named pools of stem, leaf, root and other are defined for CMIP6 but another user of CF may potentially introduce something like nBud or nFlower, for example, so then we'd need to change the list of terms contributing to the sum.

'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. On land, &quot;nitrogen fixation&quot; means the uptake of nitrogen gas directly from the atmosphere.

The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Nitrogen compounds&quot; summarizes all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms. The list of individual species that are included in this quantity can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The specification of a physica<br />

<br />In fact we do have an existing name tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.

The list of individual species that are included in this quantity can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.'

<br />Now that I understand the meaning of reactive_nitrogen, I think this is basically the quantity you need, except the sign convention is the opposite of what you want.

<br />

</em><br />
<br />I suggest an alternative approach, which might sound a bit strange, but we do have a precedent for doing this. We could add the phrase &quot;minus_one_times_&quot; to the start of the existing name so that we are using the existing quantity but reversing the sign convention. Thus a negative tendency in the atmosphere/positive tendency in terrestrial nitrogen would have a positive numerical value. There are four existing standard names where we have reversed the sign convention in this way.
<br />
<br />We would then have
<br />
minus_one_times_tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
' &quot;Minus one times&quot; means that the quantity described takes the opposite sign convention to that for the quantity which has the same standard name apart from this phrase, i.e. the two quantities differ from one another by a factor of -1. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compos<br />
e the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Deposition&quot; is the sum of wet and dry deposition. &quot;Nitrogen compounds&quot; summarizes all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms.

The &quot;soil content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the soil model.

<br />Thanks for the additional explanation. We shouldn't refer to nSoil and nMineral in the definition as these are only defined for CMIP6 - we need to make the names and definitions useful to all CF users. (However, this has helped me to understand the quantity better.) In the first group of C4MIP names we agreed soil_mass_content_of_inorganic_nitrogen_expressed_as_nitrogen, where the 'inorganic_nitrogen' was the phrase we chose to describe mineral nitrogen, nMineral. From your description I now understand nSoil to mean the organic nitrogen in the soil - is that right? To be consistent with the terminology in the existing name and to capture the full meaning of this new one, we could call it:

<br />tendency_of_soil_mass_content_of_organic_and_inorganic_nitrogen_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_fertilization (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;soil content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the soil model. For the content between specified levels in the soil, standard names including &quot;content_of_soil_layer&quot; are used. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Inorganic nitrogen&quot; describes a family of chemical species which, in soil, usually consists of nitrate and ammonium compounds which act as nitrogen nutrients. &quot;Organic nitrogen&quot; consists of all organic nitrogen compounds in the soil. &quot;Fertilization&quot; means the addition of artificial fertilizers and animal manure to soil for the purpose of increasing plant nutrient concentrations.'
<br />
<br />We could alternatively say nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen as we have in other names and emphasise in the definition that for this name it means the inorganic nutrients plus the organic compounds in the soil itself.
<br />
<br />I tend to think the first one might be clearer but I'd be happy with either approach - which do you prefer?

<br />There are eleven existing net_primary_productivity_of_biomass names so I used biomass in this one for consistency. It also allows us to maintain consistency across ocean and atmosphere names. We could change all the land based ones to say 'vegetation' and I can see that might be an improvement, particularly as biomass can also mean dead plant material, e.g, biomass fuel. However, I do also think the overall consistency in the standard names is useful. Do you have a strong preference for 'vegetation' or could you live with 'biomass' for this one?

</em><br />
<br />Okay, thank you for the explanation. Since a different rate can be applied to each of the fast, medium and slow pools I think you would also need to supply a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable alongside the data variable to label which pool the rate applies to. Such a variable could have a standard name of soil_pool and could take either a single string value chosen from 'fast', 'medium', 'slow' or an array of those strings if you wanted to store several rates in an data array with a soil pool dimension. All of this would need to be explained in the definition, so for the rates themselves we'd have:
<br />
soil_pool_carbon_decay_rate (s-1)
<br />
' &quot;Soil carbon&quot; is the organic matter present in soil quantified by the mass of carbon it contains. Soil carbon is returned to the atmosphere as the organic matter decays. Each modelled soil carbon pool has a characteristic turnover time, which is  modified by environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture  so that the turnover time varies in space and time. The quantity with standard name soil_pool_carbon_decay_rate is defined as 1/(turnover time). The data variable should be accompanied by a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with standard name soil_pool and whose value(s) are chosen from a standardised list.'
<br />
<br />Then we'd also create a new standard name for the coordinate variable:
<br />
soil_pool (NO units because it takes a string value)
<br />
A variable with the standard name of soil_pool contains strings which indicate the nature of the soil pool itself classified according to the decay rate of the organic carbon material it contains. These strings are standardised. The value(s) must be chosen from the list: fast; medium; slow.
