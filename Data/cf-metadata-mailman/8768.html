Dear Jonathan, All,
<br />
<br />No further comments have been received so the four new names proposed for FAFMIP are now accepted and will be published in the April update of the standard name table.
<br />
<br />sea_water_added_conservative_temperature, degC
<br />
' The quantity with standard name sea_water_added_conservative_temperature is a passive tracer in an ocean model whose surface flux does not come from the atmosphere but is imposed externally upon the simulated climate system. The surface flux is expressed as a heat flux and converted to a passive tracer increment as if it were a heat flux being added to conservative temperature. The passive tracer is transported within the ocean as if it were conservative temperature. The passive tracer is zero in the control climate of the model. The passive tracer records added heat, as described for the CMIP6 FAFMIP experiment (doi:10.5194/gmd-9-3993-2016), following earlier ideas. Conservative Temperature is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Conservative Temperature is specific potential enthalpy (which has the standard name sea_water_specific_potential_enthalpy) divided by a fixed value of the specific <br />
heat capacity of sea water, namely cp_0 = 3991.86795711963 J kg-1 K-1. Conservative Temperature is a more accurate measure of the &quot;heat content&quot; of sea water, by a factor of one hundred, than is potential temperature. Because of this, it can be regarded as being proportional to the heat content of sea water per unit mass. Reference: www.teos-10.org; McDougall, 2003 doi: 10.1175/1520-0485(2003)033&lt;0945:PEACOV&gt;2.0.CO;2.'

<br />
<br />Dear Jonathan,
<br />
<br />Thank you for proposing these FAFMIP names and for providing such clear definitions. I recall our previous discussion of OMIP names in which we established the necessity of using Celsius rather than Kelvin for certain ocean model temperature quantities, so the canonical units of these are fine. The names themselves are also fine - I think it is clear that these are not the usual model prognostic variables and they are unlikely to be mistaken as such. I'm happy with these names as they currently stand - unless we receive any objections in the next seven days they will be accepted for inclusion in the standard name table and published in the April update.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

Subject: [CF-metadata] standard names for FAFMIP passive tracers
<br />
<br />Dear all
<br />
<br />Martin and Alison have pointed out that four standard names needed for FAFMIP haven't yet been proposed. That was my oversight. I would now like to propose:
<br />
<br />sea_water_added_conservative_temperature, degC A passive tracer in an ocean model whose surface flux does not come from the atmosphere but is imposed externally upon the simulated climate system. The surface flux is expressed as a heat flux and converted to a passive tracer increment as if it were a heat flux being added to conservative temperature.
<br />
The passive tracer is transported within the ocean as if it were conservative temperature.  The passive tracer is zero in the control climate of the model.
<br />
The passive tracer records added heat, as described for the CMIP6 FAFMIP experiment (doi:10.5194/gmd-9-3993-2016), following earlier ideas.
<br />
** Then repeat the definition of sea_water_conservative_temperature.

<br />
Potential temperature of sea water is the temperature a parcel of sea water would have if moved adiabatically to sea level pressure.
<br />
<br />I note that in Table 3 of the paper cited we said &quot;additional&quot; temperature for the standard names, but throughout the rest of the paper we referred to &quot;added&quot;
<br />
heat (not &quot;additional&quot;), following earlier literature, and in the existing CF-netCDF data produced for FAFMIP we have used &quot;added&quot; in the standard names.
<br />
Hence I think this must have been a change of mind and should be regarded as a mistake in the paper. We will make a note of it on the FAFMIP website once this proposal has been decided upon.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
