Dear Martin, Chris,
<br />
<br />Yes, indeed these two are better as 'surface_upward' names. Thanks for the suggestion. I've modified the names (they will still be published in the next update).
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

Subject: Re: New standard names for C4MIP - part 2
Dear Chris, Alison,
These names look good. I just have one suggestion for the nitrogen emission fluxes (fNOx, fNloss): the names suggested below have the form &quot;mass_flux_of_...._out_of_...&quot;, but don't explicitly state where the mass flux is going (the atmosphere). The usage in many existing standard names for fluxes from land or ocean into the atmosphere is to start the name with &quot;surface_upward/downward_mass_flux_...&quot;, as in &quot;surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_grazing&quot;. So, I suggest modifying these two proposals as follows (modifications in bold: the help text is the standard formulation found for existing &quot;surface_upward_...&quot; names):
(fNOx)
13. surface_upward_mass_flux_of_nox_expressed_as_nitrogen_out_of_vegetation_and_litter_and_soil (kg m-2 s-1) 'In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Nox&quot; means a combination of two radical species containing nitrogen and oxygen NO+NO2. &quot;Vegetation&quot; means any living plants e.g. trees, shrubs, grass. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil.' &quot;Upward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.

Dear Chris,
Many thanks for looking through the C4MIP names again and providing the additional explanations. Apologies for taking a while to reply - some of these required careful thought!
I've taken many of the comments from your Word document and incorporated them into the names and/or definitions. I've accepted quite a number of the names (18) where we seem to have reached agreement and we're making good progress on the rest. Please let me know what you think. We still need a bit of discussion about proposals 11, 15, 16, 24, 27 and 28; there are a few others that just need to be checked before I can formally accept them.

&gt; 1-3 are sub components of nLitter: nLitter = nLitterCwd + nLitterSurf
&gt; + nLitterSubSurf
(nLitterCwd)
1. wood_debris_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2) ' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. &quot;Wood debris&quot; means dead organic matter composed of coarse wood. It is distinct from fine litter. The precise distinction between &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;coarse&quot; is model dependent. The sum of the quantities with standard names wood_debris_mass_content_of_nitrogen, surface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen and subsurface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen is the total nitrogen mass content of dead plant material.'
To maintain consistent syntax I think we should make an alias for the existing carbon name so that wood_debris_carbon_content becomes wood_debris_mass_content_of_carbon. This is also consistent with the creation of aliases  for the existing surface and subsurface litter carbon names (see the recent discussion thread starting here: <a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2018/059871.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2018/059871.html</a>)
Okay?
(nLitterSurf)
2. surface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2) ' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. It is distinct from coarse wood debris. &quot;Surface litter&quot; means the part of the litter resting above the soil surface. The precise distinction between &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;coarse&quot; is model dependent. The sum of the quantities with standard names wood_debris_mass_content_of_nitrogen, surface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen and subsurface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen is the total nitrogen mass content of dead plant material.'
Okay?
(nLitterSubSurf)
3. subsurface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2) ' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. It is distinct from coarse wood debris. &quot;Subsurface litter&quot; means the part of the litter mixed within the soil below the surface. The precise distinction between &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;coarse&quot; is model dependent. The sum of the quantities with standard names wood_debris_mass_content_of_nitrogen, surface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen and subsurface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen is the total nitrogen mass content of dead plant material.'
Okay?
(nStem)
4. stem_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2) ' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The stem of a plant is the axis that bears buds and shoots with leaves and, at its basal end, roots. Its function is to carry water and nutrients. Examples include the stalk of a plant or the main trunk of a tree.'
I constructed this definition of 'stem' from a combination of those given at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/stem-plant">https://www.britannica.com/science/stem-plant</a> and <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-plant-stem-function-types-parts.html">https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-plant-stem-function-types-parts.html</a>.
Chris wrote:
&gt; wood_biomass_content_of_nitrogen
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, we mean living biomass and not dead wood (covered in nLitterCwd 
&gt; above). Hence we prefer Stem to Wood for this reason (as per carbon pool too).
I think for consistency with all the other nitrogen and carbon plant mass content names that we should say mass, rather than biomass, in this one. I've adopted your use of 'stem' instead of 'wood'. For consistency, I think we should also make an alias for the existing carbon name so that wood_carbon_content becomes stem_mass_content_of_carbon.
Okay?
(nLeaf)
5. leaf_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2)  ' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area.'
Chris wrote:
&gt; OK

6. root_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2) ' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area.'
Chris wrote:
&gt; OK
Thank you. This name is agreed and accepted for publication in the standard name table.
(nOther)
7. miscellaneous_living_matter_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2)  ' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. &quot;Miscellaneous living matter&quot; means all those parts of living vegetation that are not leaf, wood or root or other separately named components.'
Chris wrote:
&gt; There are no other separately named pools, so nStem+nLeaf+nRoot+nOther 
&gt; should identically equal the total in nVeg (and parallel for carbon 
&gt; pools and cVeg)
I haven't added this bit into the standard name definitions in proposals 4 - 7 because the named pools of stem, leaf, root and other are defined for CMIP6 but another user of CF may potentially introduce something like nBud or nFlower, for example, so then we'd need to change the list of terms contributing to the sum.
Okay?
(fNVegSoil)
8. nitrogen_mass_flux_into_soil_from_vegetation_excluding_litter (kg m-2 s-1) 'In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. &quot;Vegetation&quot; means any living plants e.g. trees, shrubs, grass. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil.'

11. tendency_of_soil_and_vegetation_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_fixation (kg m-2 s-1) 'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. On land, &quot;nitrogen fixation&quot; means the uptake of nitrogen gas directly from the atmosphere. The representation of fixed nitrogen is model dependent, with the nitrogen entering either vegetation, soil or both. &quot;Vegetation&quot; means any living plants e.g. trees, shrubs, grass. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Nitrogen compounds&quot; summarizes all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms. The list of individual species that are included in this quantity can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The s  pecification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.'
Chris wrote:
&gt; I suggest we:
&gt; -     Say &quot;terrestrial&quot; instead of &quot;soil&quot; because this term is mainly about plants fixing nitrogen directly from N2 in the atmosphere. Some models
&gt; may have it as a term going into the vegetation, some into the soil. 
&gt;We need to capture either/both, so it's not just the tendency of the soil nitrogen.
Thanks for the explanation - I'm suggesting 'soil_and_vegetation' to be consistent with all the other names we've introduced and I've modified the definition to explain this. Is this okay?
&gt; -     Don't specify organic/inorganic. If the fixed N goes into the vegetation it will not be in inorganic form, so again we need to leave this open
&gt; to cover any form of uptake.
Okay - I've replaced it with &quot;nitrogen_compounds&quot; and a generic definition so as to cover whatever form the nitrogen takes after its uptake.
&gt; -     Don't mention anything about ammonia or diazotrophs - the terrestrial uptake doesn't go via ammonia, and I'm not sure the exact name of
&gt; the organisms that do it are relevant.
Fine, thank you. I've changed the nitrogen fixation definition to match your explanation.

In fact we do have an existing name tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.

Usually, particle bound and
  gaseous nitrogen compounds, such as atomic nitrogen (N), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitric acid (HNO3), nitrate (NO3-), peroxynitric acid (HNO4), ammonia (NH3), ammonium (NH4+), bromine nitrate (BrONO2), chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) and organic nitrates (most notably peroxyacetyl nitrate, sometimes referred to as PAN, (CH3COO2NO2)) are included. The list of individual species that are included in this quantity can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.'
Now that I understand the meaning of reactive_nitrogen, I think this is basically the quantity you need, except the sign convention is the opposite of what you want.
Chris wrote:
&gt; our intended sign convention is a positive flux into vegetation, so 
&gt; this could be tendency of terrestrial nitrogen? Rather than tendency 
&gt; of the atmosphere
I suggest an alternative approach, which might sound a bit strange, but we do have a precedent for doing this. We could add the phrase &quot;minus_one_times_&quot; to the start of the existing name so that we are using the existing quantity but reversing the sign convention. Thus a negative tendency in the atmosphere/positive tendency in terrestrial nitrogen would have a positive numerical value. There are four existing standard names where we have reversed the sign convention in this way.
We would then have
minus_one_times_tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition (kg m-2 s-1) ' &quot;Minus one times&quot; means that the quantity described takes the opposite sign convention to that for the quantity which has the same standard name apart from this phrase, i.e. the two quantities differ from one another by a factor of -1. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of te  rms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Deposition&quot; is the sum of wet and dry deposition. &quot;Nitrogen compounds&quot; summarizes all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms. Usually, particle bound and gaseous nitrogen compounds, such as atomic nitrogen (N), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitric acid (HNO3), nitrate (NO3-), peroxynitric acid (HNO4), ammonia (NH3), ammonium (NH4+), bromine nitrate (BrONO2), chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) and organic nitrates (most notably peroxyacetyl nitrate, sometimes referred to as PAN, (CH3COO2NO2)) are included.

&gt;Is it right to say 'inorganic_nitrogen' for this one? Is the definition of 'fertilization' okay?
Chris wrote:
&gt; Yes - definition of fertilisation is OK.
&gt; No - it doesn't have to be inorganic. Again this might differ by 
&gt; model, and we just want to capture how much N is going into the system. I've suggested we should also be specific that it includes either organic or inorganic pool in case the term &quot;tendency of soil mass content of nitrogen&quot;
&gt; is taken to refer to nSoil and not nMineral.
Thanks for the additional explanation. We shouldn't refer to nSoil and nMineral in the definition as these are only defined for CMIP6 - we need to make the names and definitions useful to all CF users. (However, this has helped me to understand the quantity better.) In the first group of C4MIP names we agreed soil_mass_content_of_inorganic_nitrogen_expressed_as_nitrogen, where the 'inorganic_nitrogen' was the phrase we chose to describe mineral nitrogen, nMineral. From your description I now understand nSoil to mean the organic nitrogen in the soil - is that right? To be consistent with the terminology in the existing name and to capture the full meaning of this new one, we could call it:

We could alternatively say nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen as we have in other names and emphasise in the definition that for this name it means the inorganic nutrients plus the organic compounds in the soil itself.
I tend to think the first one might be clearer but I'd be happy with either approach - which do you prefer?

&gt; OK - but suggest &quot;of vegetation&quot; rather than &quot;of biomass&quot;
There are eleven existing net_primary_productivity_of_biomass names so I used biomass in this one for consistency. It also allows us to maintain consistency across ocean and atmosphere names. We could change all the land based ones to say 'vegetation' and I can see that might be an improvement, particularly as biomass can also mean dead plant material, e.g, biomass fuel. However, I do also think the overall consistency in the standard names is useful. Do you have a strong preference for 'vegetation' or could you live with 'biomass' for this one?

&gt; This quantity is meant to complement the respiration one and give the

We request here the turnover RATE rather than TIME, defined as 1/(turnover time). Use the same pools reported under cSoilPools.
Okay, thank you for the explanation. Since a different rate can be applied to each of the fast, medium and slow pools I think you would also need to supply a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable alongside the data variable to label which pool the rate applies to. Such a variable could have a standard name of soil_pool and could take either a single string value chosen from 'fast', 'medium', 'slow' or an array of those strings if you wanted to store several rates in an data array with a soil pool dimension. All of this would need to be explained in the definition, so for the rates themselves we'd have:
soil_pool_carbon_decay_rate (s-1)
' &quot;Soil carbon&quot; is the organic matter present in soil quantified by the mass of carbon it contains. Soil carbon is returned to the atmosphere as the organic matter decays. Each modelled soil carbon pool has a characteristic turnover time, which is  modified by environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture  so that the turnover time varies in space and time. The quantity with standard name soil_pool_carbon_decay_rate is defined as 1/(turnover time). The data variable should be accompanied by a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with standard name soil_pool and whose value(s) are chosen from a standardised list.'
Then we'd also create a new standard name for the coordinate variable:
soil_pool (NO units because it takes a string value) A variable with the standard name of soil_pool contains strings which indicate the nature of the soil pool itself classified according to the decay rate of the organic carbon material it contains. These strings are standardised. The value(s) must be chosen from the list: fast; medium; slow.
