Dear Alison, Chris,
<br />
<br /><br />I have a few questions about items 21,  22, 23:
<br />
<br />21: raStem surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_due_to_plant_respiration_in_stems:
<br />
<br />22: raLeaf surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_due_to_plant_respiration_in_leaves
<br />
<br />23: raRoot surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_due_to_plant_respiration_in_roots
<br />
<br /><br />Q1: Such terms, which relate to the CO2 flux into the atmosphere, are usually of the form &quot;..flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon...&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />Have you decided that the longer form is redundant here?
<br />
<br /><br />Q2: We also have an existing name &quot;plant_respiration_carbon_flux&quot; which is used for variable &quot;ra&quot;, as in CMIP5. &quot;plant_respiration_carbon_flux&quot; is described as a mass flux of carbon into the atmosphere and soil: would it be safe to assume that the carbon respiration flux into soil is the component from the roots?  Shouldn't this be something like plant_respiration_carbon_flux_from_roots_into_soil?
<br />
<br /><br />Q3: there should be a name for &quot;raOther&quot; somewhere, which would follow the pattern established for &quot;nppOther&quot; in this discussion, but does &quot;raOther&quot; include fluxes into soil and atmosphere, as &quot;ra&quot;, or is it just a flux into the atmosphere, as &quot;raLeaf&quot; and &quot;raStem&quot;?
<br />
<br /><br />regards,
<br />
<br />Martin

<br />Dear Chris,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now agreed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 21.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, thank you. These names are all now accepted and will be published in the next update of the standard name table.
<br />
<br />Only five left to go...
<br />
<br />15. (CMIP short name fNdep)
<br />
We've discussed various solutions for this one, but now we seem to have settled on using an existing name:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So overall I favour going with the &quot;tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition&quot; name
</em><br />
<br />Thank you. I will remove this one from the list of proposals.
<br />
<br />16. (CMIP short name fNfert)
<br />
<br />Chris wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for the options - I think I favour not saying &quot;organic and inorganic&quot; in the name, and just going with &quot; nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. This seems simpler and the former doesn't add anything extra I don't think.
</em><br />
<br />Okay thank you. So I think we are now agreed on the following:
<br />
tendency_of_soil_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_fertilization (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
' The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;soil content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the soil model. For the content between specified levels in the soil, standard names including &quot;content_of_soil_layer&quot; are used. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Nitrogen compounds&quot; summarizes all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms. The list of individual species that are included in this quantity can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. &quot;Fertilization&quot; means the addition of artifi
<br />
&nbsp;cial fertilizers and animal manure to soil for the purpose of increasing plant nutrient concentrations.'
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for publication in the standard name table and will be added at the next update.

<br />24. (CMIP6 short name nppOther)
<br />
<br />Chris wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, if there are other variables which say this, then go with biomass. If I was starting again I'd say vegetation, but that's being picky - doesn't seem worth re-naming others, or introducing an inconsistency
</em><br />
<br />Okay - thank you for not being picky :)  :)
<br />
<br />So we are now agreed on the following:
<br />
net_primary_productivity_of_biomass_expressed_as_carbon_accumulated_in_miscellaneous_living_matter (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
' &quot;Miscellaneous living matter&quot; means all those parts of living vegetation that are not leaf, wood, root or other separately named components. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Production of carbon&quot; means the production of biomass expressed as the mass of carbon which it contains. Net primary production is the excess of gross primary production (rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors) by autotrophs (&quot;producers&quot;), for example, photosynthesis in plants or phytoplankton, over the rate at which the autotrophs themselves respire some of this biomass. &quot;Productivity&quot; means production per unit area.'
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for publication in the standard name table and will be added at the next update.

<br />Chris wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I agree this should be reported for each soil pool. But not all models have the same pools. We have deliberately moved away from having fast/medium and slow pools (we deleted these from the CMIP6 request) because it turned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out from CMIP5 they simply weren't helpful. So now the request for cSoil is to report for each pool. So the decay rate should be reported for the same pools that each model reports soil carbon. It makes no sense to have decay rate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without the soil carbon, so the two go together. What is the way that cSoilPools is being reported? This one should mirror that
</em><br />
<br />Right. My understanding (based on a spreadsheet prepared by Martin) is that cSoilPools will use the existing standard name soil_carbon_content and that the data variable to which this name is attached will indeed have a soil pool dimension. So I think my general approach is the right one, but evidently we shouldn't standardize on 'fast', 'medium', 'slow' for the soil pool names if all the modelling groups are doing something different. We could use a string valued coordinate variable and allow non-standardized strings to name the pools, or maybe just index them with integers.  I think it would be helpful if Martin could comment before we make any decisions.
<br />
<br />Just to summarize, for the tSoilPools name I'm still currently suggesting:
<br />
soil_pool_carbon_decay_rate (s-1)
<br />
' &quot;Soil carbon&quot; is the organic matter present in soil quantified by the mass of carbon it contains. Soil carbon is returned to the atmosphere as the organic matter decays. Each modelled soil carbon pool has a characteristic turnover time, which is  modified by environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture  so that the turnover time varies in space and time. The quantity with standard name soil_pool_carbon_decay_rate is defined as 1/(turnover time). The data variable should be accompanied by a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with standard name soil_pool.'
<br />
<br />I had previously suggested that soil_pool should be a string valued coordinate variable, but I'm less certain about that now.
<br />
<br />This name is still under discussion.
<br />
<br />-- comments from Martin --
<br />
For cSoilPools we have used a  string valued &quot;soilpools&quot; coordinate with no standardisation of the values. This is not ideal, but it follows the pattern set by the &quot;vegtype&quot; dimension used in CMIP5 for the landCoverFrac variable in Lmon. I have reviewed the data submitted to CMIP5, and listed the &quot;vegtype&quot; values used here: <a href="https://github.com/cmip6dr/CMIP6_DataRequest_VariableDefinitions/blob/master/cmip5_landCoverUsage.xls">https://github.com/cmip6dr/CMIP6_DataRequest_VariableDefinitions/blob/master/cmip5_landCoverUsage.xls</a> . We have discussed how to improve this situation, but could not find a solution for &quot;vegtype&quot;, in part because we did not want to expend disproportionate effort on a variable which was only supplied by a handful of models and because there are no complaints from users. Hence, I think we cab accept the same compromise for &quot;soilpools&quot;, if there is no clear set of standard values to use.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree except that we should probably just drop the &quot;passive&quot;. CO2 is passive in the chemical reaction sense that it gets advected round the atmosphere but doesn't undergo chemical reactions. But it's certainly not passive in terms

</em><br />
<br />Okay, thank you. That makes sense now! I think that leaves us with:
<br />
mass_fraction_of_carbon_dioxide_tracer_in_air (Units: 1)
<br />
'The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. Mass fraction is used in the construction &quot;mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. A &quot;tracer&quot; is a quantity advected by a model to facilitate analysis of flow patterns.'

<br />I think for consistency with all the other nitrogen and carbon plant mass content names that we should say mass, rather than biomass, in this one. I've adopted your use of 'stem' instead of 'wood'. For consistency, I think we should also make an alias for the existing carbon name so that wood_carbon_content becomes stem_mass_content_of_carbon.

<br />I haven't added this bit into the standard name definitions in proposals 4 - 7 because the named pools of stem, leaf, root and other are defined for CMIP6 but another user of CF may potentially introduce something like nBud or nFlower, for example, so then we'd need to change the list of terms contributing to the sum.

<br />Okay - I've replaced it with &quot;nitrogen_compounds&quot; and a generic definition so as to cover whatever form the nitrogen takes after its uptake.

<br />I suggest an alternative approach, which might sound a bit strange, but we do have a precedent for doing this. We could add the phrase &quot;minus_one_times_&quot; to the start of the existing name so that we are using the existing quantity but reversing the sign convention. Thus a negative tendency in the atmosphere/positive tendency in terrestrial nitrogen would have a positive numerical value. There are four existing standard names where we have reversed the sign convention in this way.

minus_one_times_tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition (kg m-2 s-1) ' &quot;Minus one times&quot; means that the quantity described takes the opposite sign convention to that for the quantity which has the same standard name apart from this phrase, i.e. the two quantities differ from one another by a factor of -1. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area.

<br />
<br />What do you think to this approach?
<br />
<br />Thanks for the suggestion. While this makes some sense, I think I favour sticking with the existing definition and putting up with the sign convention. This is because:
<br />
- the field is always going to have the same sign (from atmosphere to the land/ocean surface), and so if someone expects or reports it wrongly it will be instantly obvious
<br />
- therefore having one name and possible confusion over the sign is less dangerous than having two variables for essentially the same thing - this would require groups to have to process and store it twice, but simply flip the sign and re-name it. I think this causes greater confusion
<br />
- having two names carries the risk that one might somehow become different from the other which we want to avoid - we want our system to conserve, and so anything that leaves the atmosphere should enter the land/ocean
<br />
<br />So overall I favour going with the &quot; tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition&quot; name

<br />Thanks for the additional explanation. We shouldn't refer to nSoil and nMineral in the definition as these are only defined for CMIP6 - we need to make the names and definitions useful to all CF users. (However, this has helped me to understand the quantity better.) In the first group of C4MIP names we agreed soil_mass_content_of_inorganic_nitrogen_expressed_as_nitrogen, where the 'inorganic_nitrogen' was the phrase we chose to describe mineral nitrogen, nMineral. From your description I now understand nSoil to mean the organic nitrogen in the soil - is that right? To be consistent with the terminology in the existing name and to capture the full meaning of this new one, we could call it:

<br />We could alternatively say nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen as we have in other names and emphasise in the definition that for this name it means the inorganic nutrients plus the organic compounds in the soil itself.
<br />
<br />I tend to think the first one might be clearer but I'd be happy with either approach - which do you prefer?
<br />
<br /><br />Thanks for the options - I think I favour not saying &quot;organic and inorganic&quot; in the name, and just going with &quot; nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. This seems simpler and the former doesn't add anything extra I don't think.

Chris wrote:
&gt; OK - but suggest &quot;of vegetation&quot; rather than &quot;of biomass&quot;
There are eleven existing net_primary_productivity_of_biomass names so I used biomass in this one for consistency. It also allows us to maintain consistency across ocean and atmosphere names. We could change all the land based ones to say 'vegetation' and I can see that might be an improvement, particularly as biomass can also mean dead plant material, e.g, biomass fuel. However, I do also think the overall consistency in the standard names is useful. Do you have a strong preference for 'vegetation' or could you live with 'biomass' for this one?
OK, if there are other variables which say this, then go with biomass. If I was starting again I'd say vegetation, but that's being picky - doesn't seem worth re-naming others, or introducing an inconsistency

Okay, thank you for the explanation. Since a different rate can be applied to each of the fast, medium and slow pools I think you would also need to supply a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable alongside the data variable to label which pool the rate applies to. Such a variable could have a standard name of soil_pool and could take either a single string value chosen from 'fast', 'medium', 'slow' or an array of those strings if you wanted to store several rates in an data array with a soil pool dimension. All of this would need to be explained in the definition, so for the rates themselves we'd have:
soil_pool_carbon_decay_rate (s-1)
' &quot;Soil carbon&quot; is the organic matter present in soil quantified by the mass of carbon it contains. Soil carbon is returned to the atmosphere as the organic matter decays.

The quantity with standard name soil_pool_carbon_decay_rate is defined as 1/(turnover time). The data variable should be accompanied by a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with standard name soil_pool and whose value(s) are chosen from a standardised list.'
Then we'd also create a new standard name for the coordinate variable:
soil_pool (NO units because it takes a string value) A variable with the standard name of soil_pool contains strings which indicate the nature of the soil pool itself classified according to the decay rate of the organic carbon material it contains. These strings are standardised. The value(s) must be chosen from the list: fast; medium; slow.
What do you think?
OK, I agree this should be reported for each soil pool. But not all models have the same pools. We have deliberately moved away from having fast/medium and slow pools (we deleted these from the CMIP6 request) because it turned out from CMIP5 they simply weren't helpful. So now the request for cSoil is to report for each pool. So the decay rate should be reported for the same pools that each model reports soil carbon. It makes no sense to have decay rate without the soil carbon, so the two go together. What is the way that cSoilPools is being reported? This one should mirror that

Okay, so the name should then be:
mass_fraction_of_carbon_dioxide_passive_tracer_in_air (Units: 1 (because it's kg kg-1)) ' The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. Mass fraction is used in the construction &quot;mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. A &quot;passive tracer&quot; is a quantity advected by a model to facilitate analysis of flow patterns. It has no effect on any of the model's processes and only the model's dynamical processes affect the tracer.'
(The definition of passive_tracer is new to standard names).
Okay?
I agree except that we should probably just drop the &quot;passive&quot;. CO2 is passive in the chemical reaction sense that it gets advected round the atmosphere but doesn't undergo chemical reactions. But it's certainly not passive in terms of not affecting the rest of the model - it's a greenhouse gas and exactly why we're running the model in the first place. It very strongly affects the radiative balance of the world. So I simply suggest we remove &quot;passive&quot;, then the rest looks OK.
Best wishes,
