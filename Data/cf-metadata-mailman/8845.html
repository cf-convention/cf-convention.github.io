Dear All,
<br />
<br /><br />Here is an initial batch of 8 Standard Names to support the CF taxon dimension. Two are dimension labels whilst the other six are measurements to which the taxon is a co-ordinate. Five of these are to cover Daniel's proposal that prompted the resurrection of Ticket 99.
<br />
<br /><br />I've presented a summary list followed by a full list with units and definitions.  I have one uncertainty in my mind (biological_taxon_label versus biological_taxon_lsid) where I would really appreciate input.
<br />
<br /><br />Cheers, Roy.
<br />
<br />biological_taxon_name
<br />
biological_taxon_identifier or biological_taxon_lsid ? any preferences????
<br />
number_concentration_of_biological_taxon_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_biological_taxon_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />

<br />
mole_concentration_of_biological_taxon_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
<br /><br />biological_taxon_name
<br />
<br />A plaintext human-readable label, usually a Latin binomial such as Calanus finmarchicus, applied to a biological taxon. Biological taxon is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy.
<br />
<br />dimensionless
<br />
<br />biological_taxon_identifier
<br />
<br />An opaque label, most usefully a URI that resolves to an authoritative information source, applied to a biological taxon. Biological taxon is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy. The identifier adopted for CF is the Life Science Identifier (LSID), a URN with the syntax ?urn:lsid:&lt;Authority&gt;:&lt;Namespace&gt;:&lt;ObjectID&gt;[:&lt;Version&gt;]?. For example, the copepod Calocalanus pavo may be represented by LSIDs ?urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:104669? (based on WoRMS) and urn:lsid:itis.gov:itis_tsn:85335? (based on ITIS). These URNs may be converted to URLs delivering RDF by prefixing with '<a href="http://lsid.tdwg.org/">http://lsid.tdwg.org/</a>'.
<br />
<br />dimensionless
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />biological_taxon_lsid
<br />
<br />The Life Science Identifier (LSID) is a standard URI for a biological taxon. Biological taxon is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy. The LSID is a URN with the syntax ?urn:lsid:&lt;Authority&gt;:&lt;Namespace&gt;:&lt;ObjectID&gt;[:&lt;Version&gt;]?. For example, the copepod Calocalanus pavo may be represented by LSIDs ?urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:104669? (based on WoRMS) and urn:lsid:itis.gov:itis_tsn:85335? (based on ITIS). These URNs may be converted to URLs delivering RDF by prefixing with '<a href="http://lsid.tdwg.org/">http://lsid.tdwg.org/</a>'.
<br />
<br />dimensionless
<br />
<br />number_concentration_of_biological_taxon_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Number concentration means the count of an entity per unit volume and is used in the construction ?number_concentration_of_X_in_Y?, where X is a material constituent of Y.. Biological taxon is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy. Number concentration of biota is also referred to as abundance.
<br />
<br />m-3
<br />
<br />mass_concentration_of_biological_taxon_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction ?mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y?, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as
<br />
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction ?A_expressed_as_B?, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Mass concentration of biota expressed as carbon is also referred to as carbon biomass. Biological taxon is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;kg m-3
<br />
<br /><br />mass_concentration_of_biological_taxon_expressed_as_chlorophyll_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction ?mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y?, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the
<br />
construction ?A_expressed_as_B?, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Chlorophyll means all naturally occurring pigments of the chlorophyll group. Biological taxon is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;kg m-3
<br />
<br />&nbsp;mass_concentration_of_biological_taxon_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction ?mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y?, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as
<br />
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction ?A_expressed_as_B?, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Mass concentration of biota expressed as nitrogen is also referred to as nitrogen biomass. Biological taxon is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy.
<br />
<br />kg m-3
<br />
<br />mole_concentration_of_biological_taxon_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called ?molarity?, and is used in the construction ?mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y?, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction ?A_expressed_as_B?, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Biological taxon is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy.
<br />
<br />mol m-3
<br />
<br />mole_concentration_of_biological_taxon_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
