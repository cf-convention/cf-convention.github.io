Hi John,
<br />
<br /><br />To my thinking your arguments add support for 'biological_taxon_lsid' over 'biological_taxon_identifier' defined as LSID, which Jonathan prefers and I am starting to feel better about. LSIDs backed by the WoRMS and ITIS taxonomies cover the biological oceanography use cases known to me. Should use cases within the sphere of CF with the need for additional identifiers come along, we can accommodate these through the straightforward mechanism of Standard Name creation.  Remember Standard Name creation is on a 'current needs' basis, not setting up to cover possible future needs.
<br />
<br /><br />Note the initial solution is designed to be semantically verifiable through cross-checking the name against the identifier, so having a single 'identifier' that can take many forms would not be helpful.
<br />
<br /><br />Cheers, Roy.
<br />
<br /><br />Please note that I partially retired on 01/11/2015. I am now only working 7.5 hours a week and can only guarantee e-mail response on Wednesdays, my day in the office. All vocabulary queries should be sent to enquiries at bodc.ac.uk. Please also use this e-mail if your requirement is urgent.

Subject: Re: [CF-metadata] Fw: Standard Names to support Trac ticket 99
<br />
<br />(Please note caveats in my final paragraph.)
<br />
<br />Because I have been in at least one (biomedical) meeting in the last year where LSIDs have been dismissed as not good solutions for that community?s purposes, and because I know there are multiple taxonomy classification systems *and* multiple taxonomy identifier systems, I would not support *only* allowing an LSID identifier. I think that is inappropriately restrictive.  (For those who wonder, I assure you there are biomedical applications throughout environmental science, and plenty of earth science applications using biomedical resources and identifiers. So I think this data point is applicable.)
<br />
<br />The way I think about it is that there should be an identifier for the taxon that is at a minimum globally unique. And, if at all possible that identifier (as is) should be resolvable using standard DNS resolution. As described, an LSID URN by itself is not resolvable, but requires an additional prefix. (And in some cases some unpleasant escape sequences, but technology adoption will slowly overcome that part.)
<br />
<br />So I would support one of the following options:
<br />
* biological_taxon_identifier by itself, defined as a globally unique and resolvable (_as is_) identifier (LSIDs would have to be entered using a resolvable form)
<br />
* biological_taxon_identifier by itself, recognizing that some identifiers may not be resolvable as is (which makes the whole solution less automatically computable)
<br />
* biological_taxon_identifier (either of the above) plus biological_taxon_lsid ? that is, provide both options, the user can specify one or both. This way the LSID fans can specify the identifier in their terms, and those with a more expansive identifier palette can use their identifier of choice. Semantic resolution, if not immediately available using existing mappings, can be achieved as needed through additional post hoc mappings, consistent with best semantic web practices.
<br />
<br />In that vein, I would propose a different definition for the biological_taxon_identifier. I am adding that it has to be globally unique, and subtracting that it is opaque (because that is a best practice for many situations, but not all), but also not using the word label, because that implies semantic meaning to me. I specify IRI rather than URI because I understand that is the modern form. I am also not favoring LSID in the definition based on my historical and present understanding that these are not universally accepted in all communities (it is conceivable this is no longer true, despite the cited case above); because IMHO the identifier should be an IRI in the first place; and because we can specifically offer an LSID identifier as well. Finally, I am open to the existence of biologically classification system that are not hierarchical. So:
<br />
<br />&quot;A globally unique string, most usefully an IRI that resolves to an authoritative information source, referencing a specific biological taxon. Biological taxon is a defined entity representing an organism or a group of organisms as a (typically hierarchical) unit of biological classification.?
<br />
<br />This is pretty radically different than what has been proposed, and my knowledge in the taxonomic classification space is much more from a technical perspective, not scientifically authoritative at all. So if I?m the only one concerned on these points, I?ll get out of the way. Even though I am pretty firmly convinced of the importance of using unambiguously semantically interoperable and resolvable identifiers, and of the extensive use of non-LSID taxonomic identifiers (search ?organism? in BioPortal to find both good and bad examples of this).
<br />

<br />
<br />Thanks Daniel,
<br />
<br />To clarify LSID isn't a database, it's an identifier for an organism that neatly brings together multiple taxonomies under the single umbrella of the Catalogue of Life project. It also resolves, actually in multiple ways, into a URL that then provides access into a database providing information on that organism.
<br />
<br />We came to the conclusion that we should use LSIDs in CF in the first round of discussions on Trac 99. My quandary is not whether we should use them, but whether the Standard Name should specify 'lsid' or just 'identifier'.  'Identifier' is what we discussed, but 'lsid' opens the door for future Standard Names based on other governances should there be a need to deal with entities not covered by lsids. I'm aware of one possible issue related to coccoliths plus the possibility of dealing with organism parts (e.g. cod livers).
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />Dear Roy,
<br />
<br />Thank you for bringing this topic forward!
<br />
<br />I contacted the responsible person for our institute's data publishing und metadata policy and will talk to her about the choice of the LSID database. She is more into that topic than I am. It may take some days.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />

Dear All,
<br />
<br />Here is an initial batch of 8 Standard Names to support the CF taxon dimension. Two are dimension labels whilst the other six are measurements to which the taxon is a co-ordinate. Five of these are to cover Daniel's proposal that prompted the resurrection of Ticket 99.
<br />
<br />I've presented a summary list followed by a full list with units and definitions.  I have one uncertainty in my mind (biological_taxon_label versus biological_taxon_lsid) where I would really appreciate input.
