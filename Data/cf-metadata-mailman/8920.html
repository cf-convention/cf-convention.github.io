Dear Burkhardt,
<br />
<br />Thank you for getting back to me about these names. I have followed your suggestion and included advice of when to choose the graupel names in preference to hail names as in the example below.
<br />
<br />atmosphere_mass_content_of_hail (kg m-2)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. Hail is precipitation in the form of balls or irregular lumps of ice, often restricted by a size convention to diameters of 5 mm or more. Reference: American Meteorological Society Glossary <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hail">http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hail</a>. For diameters of less  than 5 mm standard names for &quot;graupel&quot; should be used. Standard names for &quot;graupel_and_hail&quot; should be used to describe data produced by models that do not distinguish between hail and graupel.'
<br />
<br />With this amendment to the definitions of the hail names I think all the names are now agreed. All ten are accepted and will be added to the standard name table in the May update.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<br />Dear Alison,
<br />
<br />thank you for polishing the definitions and spotting the error in the units for the fluxes.
<br />
Your definitions look find to me. In the definitions for hail it may be added that for sizes lower than 5mm the name ?graupel&quot; should be used.
<br />
<br />Regards

<br />Dear Burkhardt, Martin and Jonathan,
<br />
<br />Thank you Burkhardt for these proposals for hail and graupel names and thanks to Martin and Jonathan for commenting.
<br />
<br />The names themselves look fine. For the flux names graupel_fall_flux, hail_fall_flux and graupel_and_hail_fall_flux I think the units should be kg m-2 s-1 as for other precipitation flux names.
<br />
<br />I agree with Martin's suggestion of basing the hail and graupel definitions on the AMS glossary and allowing the size criteria to be applied as appropriate, while still allowing for variations between models. I think it would be useful to add some sentences to the definitions to provide cross-references between the various names. This would help users to decide whether to use separate hail and graupel names or the combined names for their own data.
<br />
<br />Burkhardt, please could you check through the names again and let me know if you are happy with them? If so, then I think these can all be included in the May standard name table update.
<br />
<br />1. atmosphere_mass_content_of_graupel (kg m-2)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. Graupel consists of heavily rimed snow particles, often called snow pellets; often indistinguishable from very small soft hail except when the size convention that hail must have a diameter greater than 5 mm is adopted. Reference: American Meteorological Society Glossary <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Graupel">http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Graupel</a>. There are also separate standard names for hail. Standard names for &quot;graupel_and_hail&quot; should be used to describe data produced by models that do not distinguish between hail and graupel.'
<br />
<br />Is this okay?
<br />
<br />2. atmosphere_mass_content_of_hail (kg m-2)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.

<br />
<br />Okay?
<br />

' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.

For models that do distinguish between them, separate<br />
&nbsp;standard names for hail and graupel are available.'
<br />
<br />I think it's still useful to explain the terms 'hail' and 'graupel' in the definition, even if this name represents a combination of them. Okay?
<br />
<br />4. mass_fraction_of_hail_in_air (1)
<br />
'Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X).

<br />Dear Burkhardt,
<br />
<br /><br />We could have an additional set of standard names:
<br />
<br />atmospheric_mass_content_of_graupel_and_hail, and instruct modeling centres to use the one which fits their modeling approach.
<br />
<br /><br />But the UM presentation implies that they have a partition of the solid phase between ice, snow and graupel, while the AMS has an additional category of &quot;small ice pellets&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />It may be better to follow a pragmatic approach and relax the 5mm specification (especially as the concept of &quot;diameter&quot; is difficult to apply to an &quot;irregular lump&quot; of ice):
<br />

<br /><br />For CMIP6 we have some quantities which refer to all solid phases of water (e.g. in <a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2018/059965.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2018/059965.html</a> : precipitation_flux_of_solid_water_containing_2H) which would presumably be snow+graupel+hail+small ice pellets,

The difference of graupel and hail is mainly by the definition of the size as far as I know. Graupel: diameter sizes = 5mm. I guess models need to have a two-moment cloud scheme implemented to distinguish between graupel and hail.
<br />
In case of single moment schemes which are the general case in most atmospheric climate models, there is just one category for graupel+hail (if a model provides this at all). From <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sws00rsp/teaching/nanjing/microphysics.pdf">http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sws00rsp/teaching/nanjing/microphysics.pdf</a> it reads that in the UM the graupel+hail is just called graupel. The naming is actually the same in the one moment schemes of COSMO-model and WRF.
<br />
I agree with your proposal to extend the description of hail.
<br />
Any idea on how to distinguish between the use of graupel definition in a one-moment scheme (graupel includes hail sizes) and in a two moment scheme (graupel &lt; 5mm, hail &gt;= 5mm)?

&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. Graupel consists of heavily rimed snow particles, often called snow pellets; often indistinguishable from very small soft hail except for the size convention that hail must have a diameter greater than 5 mm.

<br />Dear Burkhardt,
<br />
<br /><br />the names look good to me, but I have a question about the precise definition of &quot;hail&quot;, which has not previously been used in CF standard names. The existing name &quot;graupel_fall_amount&quot; cites the AMS definition for graupel : &quot;Heavily rimed snow particles, often called snow pellets; often indistinguishable from very small soft hail except for the size convention that hail must have a diameter greater than 5 mm.&quot; The corresponding AMS definition for hail is:
<br />
<br />Precipitation in the form of balls or irregular lumps of ice, always produced by convective clouds, nearly always cumulonimbus.
<br />
<br />An individual unit of hail is called a hailstone. By convention, hail has a diameter of 5 mm or more, while smaller particles of similar origin, formerly called small hail, may be classed as either ice pellets or snow pellets. Thunderstorms that are characterized by strong updrafts, large liquid water contents, large cloud-drop sizes, and great vertical height are favorable to hail formation. The destructive effects of hailstorms upon plant and animal life, buildings and property, and aircraft in flight render them a prime object of weather modification studies. In aviation weather observations, hail is encoded A.
<br />
Is this what you intend with the proposed name, including the fixed size threshold of 5mm? I would have considered 4mm diameter balls of ice falling out of the sky as hail, but the 5mm rule appears to be part of the scientific definition of the term.
<br />
<br />If so, we could add an abbreviated form of the AMS definition to the standard name descriptions:
<br />
&quot;Hail is precipitation in the form of balls or irregular lumps of ice with a diameter of 5mm or more. Reference: American Meteorological Society Glossary <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hail">http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hail</a> .&quot;
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
Martin

<br />Dear Burkhardt
<br />
<br />These fit existing patterns, I believe, so they should be fine. Thanks.

<br />I propose the following standard names:
<br />
<br />atmosphere_mass_content_of_graupel
<br />
units: kg m-2
<br />
&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.
