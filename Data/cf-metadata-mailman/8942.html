Adding a minor amendment to the units for the 'wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum' parameters. These should be 'm2 s' rather than 'm2s' in order to be parsed by UDUNITS.

Subject: [CF-metadata] proposed additional names for sea_surface_wave parameters
<br />
<br />Hi all,
<br />
<br />Please find proposals for some additional sea_surface_wave parameters, which will be provided as part of Met Office operational forecast products in the near future. Hopefully nothing too contentious as mostly an extension of some existing CF names.
<br />
<br /><br />1.       Addition of 'tertiary_swell' names for existing wave parameters defined under 'wind_wave', 'primary_swell' and 'secondary_swell' categories. So would add:
<br />
<br />sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_from_direction
<br />
units: degree
<br />
The quantity with standard name sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_from_direction is the direction from which the third most energetic swell waves are coming. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The tertiary swell wave is the third most energetic swell wave. The phrase &quot;from_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_from_direction and indicates the direction from which the velocity vector of X is coming. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_mean_period
<br />
units: s
<br />
The quantity with standard name sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_mean_period is the mean period of the third most energetic swell waves. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The tertiary swell wave is the third most energetic wave in the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Wave period is the interval of time between repeated features on the waveform such as crests, troughs or upward passes through the mean level. Wave mean period is the mean period measured over the observation duration.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_significant_height
<br />
Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The tertiary swell wave is the third most energetic wave in the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. Significant wave height is a statistic computed from wave measurements and corresponds to the average height of the highest one third of the waves, where the height is defined as the vertical distance from a wave trough to the following wave crest.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />2.       Addition of peak wave period parameter to 'wind_wave', 'primary_swell', 'secondary_swell' and 'tertiary_swell' categories. This follows the existing standard for 'sea_surface_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum' and adds:
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wind_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum
<br />
units: s
<br />
The quantity with standard name sea_surface_wind_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the period of the most energetic waves within the wind wave component of a sea. Wind waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the high frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. The phrase &quot;wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave period, describes the period of the most energetic waves within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum
<br />
units: s
<br />
The quantity with standard name sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the period of the most energetic waves within the primary swell wave component of a sea. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The primary swell wave is the most energetic wave component in the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. The phrase &quot;wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave period, describes the period of the most energetic waves within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_secondary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum
<br />
units: s
<br />
The quantity with standard name sea_surface_secondary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the period of the most energetic waves within the secondary swell wave component of a sea. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The secondary swell wave is the most energetic wave component in the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. The phrase &quot;wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave period, describes the period of the most energetic waves within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum
<br />
units: s
<br />
The quantity with standard name sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the period of the most energetic waves within the tertiary swell wave component of a sea. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The tertiary swell wave is the third most energetic wave component in the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. The phrase &quot;wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave period, describes the period of the most energetic waves within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />3.       Addition of energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum parameter to existing 'wind_wave', 'primary_swell', 'secondary_swell' and 'tertiary_swell' categories. This follows the existing standard for 'sea_surface_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum' and adds:
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wind_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum
<br />
units: m2s
<br />
The quantity with standard name sea_surface_wind_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the energy of the most energetic waves within the wind wave component of a sea. Wind waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the high frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The phrase &quot;wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave energy, describes the maximum value of the wave_variance_spectral_density within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum
<br />
units: m2s
<br />
The quantity with standard name sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the energy of the most energetic waves within the primary swell wave component of a sea.

<br />
units: m2s
<br />
The quantity with standard name sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the energy of the most energetic waves within the secondary swell wave component of a sea.

The phrase &quot;wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave energy, describes the maximum value of the wave_variance_spectral_density within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum
<br />
units: m2s
<br />
