Dear Jonathan,
<br />
<br />Well spotted! I think they should all say 'mass_content'. So we should have 
<br />
nitrogen_mass_content_of_forestry_and_agricultural_products (kg m-2) for nProduct
<br />
soil_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2) for nSoil.
<br />
<br />I will update them in the standard names editor. They will still be published in the May update.
<br />
<br />In the last update I made some aliases for carbon content names and I've just realised I missed one:
<br />
vegetation_carbon_content -&gt; vegetation_mass_content_of_carbon (kg m-2).
<br />
I'll add this one into the May update.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<br />Dear Alison
<br />
<br />Yes, I agree with Martin's 13C and 14C names, which I queried. I also agree with you about nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen.
<br />
<br />Reading through this list, I compared these:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg m-2) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nitrogen_content_of_forestry_and_agricultural_products (kg m-2) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (kg m-2) vegetation_mass_content_of_nitrogen (kg 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; m-2)
</em><br />
<br />Why do two of them have mass_content and two just content? 
<br />
