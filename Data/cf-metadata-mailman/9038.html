Dear Jonathan,
<br />
<br /><br />I believe that they are repeat calculations in the model, as you suggest. They have been requested for PMIP by Yves Balkanski, so Yves may be able to comment more on this point (the question refers to swsrfasdust and related variables),
<br />
<br /><br />regards,
<br />
<br />Martin

<br />Dear Martin and Karl
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In CMIP6, we want, for each experiment, surface net downward longwave flux (rls) and the two aerosol sub-components, surface net downward longwave flux due to the ambient aerosol direct effect and surface net downward longwave flux due to dust in clear sky. I feel that this falls comfortably into the existing usage for the &quot;due_to&quot; construction.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that if these fluxes mean the part of the net downward flux LW flux
<br />
that is emitted by the ambient aerosol or by the dust you could say it was
<br />
&quot;due to&quot;. How are they calculated? Are there repeated radiation calculations
<br />
in the model, like for the clear-sky fluxes?
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Alison, Martin, and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the last point commented on by Martin:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;4.3-4.7 Perturbed radiation calculations&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wonder if it is wise to assign a new name every time experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditions change.  I would limit names to quantities that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculated independently by a physics model or that can be measured
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more-or-less directly using instruments.  A quantity that is obtained by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subtraction or by redoing a calculation with altered conditions could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described as being &quot;due to X&quot; where X is whatever condition was changed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I'm afraid these names will multiply endlessly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it is fine that we include &quot;clear-sky fluxes of radiation&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because they are both measured and must be calculated as part of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal radiation calculation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would be unhappy with &quot;temperature_change_due_to_greenhouse_gases&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'temperature_change_due_to_aerosols&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;temperature_change_due_to_solar_variability&quot;, etc. Each of these can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obtained by carefully designed experiments and they do contribute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individually to the total temperature change found in a historical run,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it in all cases I think the standard_name (air_temperature, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_air_temperature) should identify the quantity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, I would leave out &quot;due to ...&quot; in the definitions proposed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [I realize this is a judgement call about where to draw the line.]

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I?ve checked the initial request from PMIP and it now looks clear to me that the dry aerosol mass flux is wanted for these variables. I?ve copied Yves Balkanski in to this discussion, as he specified these parameters for PMIP and may wish to comment. For mass budgets of aerosol amounts it makes more sense to deal with dry aerosol fluxes, rather than ambient mass which depends on local conditions. The definition of ?dry aerosol? is, I believe, intended to refer to aerosol propoerties applied to aerosol particles which have been dehydrated, either physically or conceptually, in order to make the required measurement, not to aerosols which are naturally free of moisture in the atmosphere. I accept your other suggestions, hence

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 4.3-4.7 Perturbed radiation calculations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As I understand it, terms or the form radiative flux due to X refer to the result of a perturbed radiation calculation, with other factors, such as atmospheric and surface temperature and reflectivity held constant. Hence, the upwelling longwave flux will be unchanged, as you suggest, but not the upwelling shortwave flux: the upwelling flux will change when the downwelling flux is modified by changing the radiation calculation. There is a slight problem with the approach here, in that the &quot;due_to_X&quot; construction is intended to be used to distinguish contributions from different processes &quot;X&quot;, but &quot;ambient_aerosol&quot; is not strictly a process: the process is ambient aerosol contributions to the radiative transfer calculations.   In proposing these names I stayed with the compact form, which has been used previously, rather than trying to expand to indicate the process itself explicitly in the standard name. The questions raised here make me wonder whether we should be more expansive. In the scientific liter</em><br />
ature the terms &quot;direct effect&quot; and &quot;indirect effect&quot; are now well established, with &quot;direct effect&quot; referring to the impact of aerosol on the radiative transfer calculation through scattering and absorbtion. The indirect effect refers to other changes caused by aerosol through processes such as cloud seeding. Hence, I suggest sticking with the &quot;net_downward&quot; formulation (it is required for shortwave, and using the same approach for longwave looks neater to me), and appending &quot;direct_effect&quot;:

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Dear Martin and Jonathan,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thank you for proposing this set of names and for the comments received so far. The proposals look good - I have accepted a couple that seem straight forward and I think we can agree the rest quite quickly. Please have a look through my comments on the individual names and let me know what you think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (1.1) CMIP6 short name mrtws. Terrestrial Water Storage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; land_based_water_amount (kg m-2) 'The quantity with standard name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; land_based_water_amount, often known as &quot;Terrestrial Water Storage&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; includes surface water (water in rivers, wetlands, lakes, snow, vegetation and reservoirs) and subsurface water (soil moisture, groundwater).'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Jonathan has suggested land_water_amount for consistency with land_ice names. I agree this is a good idea, especially if the term &quot;land water&quot; is already in general use. Regarding the definition, it seems we should also include at least some elements of land_ice within land_water, but there is a question as to whether this would also include floating ice shelves and/or ice sheets.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This name is still under discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (1.2) CMIP6 short name Flashrate. Lightning flash rate cf.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; number_of_icebergs_per_unit_area; number_of_observations There are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; standard names for frequency of events, but we can adapt the &quot;number_of_&quot; construction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Proposed name:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; frequency_of_lightning_flash_per_unit_area (km-2 s-1) 'A lightning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; flash is a compound event, usually consists of several discharges.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Jonathan has suggested, and Martin has agreed to, frequency_of_lightning_flashes_per_unit_area. I agree that name looks fine. I think the canonical units should probably by m-2 s-1, and I've added a sentence about frequency to the definition:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; frequency_of_lightning_flashes_per_unit_area (m-2 s-1) 'A lightning flash is a compound event, usually consisting of several discharges. Frequency is the number of oscillations of a wave, or the number of occurrences of an event, per unit time.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Is this okay? This name is still under discussion.

A net upward flux is the difference between the flux from below (upward) and the flux from above (downward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The chemical formula for methane is CH4. Methane is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkanes. There are standard names for the alkane group as well as for some of the individual species. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). &quot;Emission&quot; is a pr</em><br />
ocess entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. W  etlands are areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season. The precise conditions under which wetlands produce and consume methane can vary between models. The quantity with standard name surface_net_upward_mass_flux_of_methane_due_to_emission_from_wetland_biological_processes is the difference between the upward and downward surface fluxes of methane which have standard names surface_upward_mass_flux_of_methane_due_to_emission_from_wetland_biological_production and surface_downward_mass_flux_of_methane_due_to_wetland_biological_consumption, respectively.'

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The fact that this one says 'insoluble' makes me think this is what we would usually call 'dry_aerosol', i.e. it hasn't (or can't) take up water from the atmosphere. That would then suggest that proposal 4.1 is referring to ambient aerosol because it doesn't say 'insoluble'. Do others agree with that line of reasoning? We have existing names for 'coarse_mode' aerosol particles, defined as having a diameter greater than 1 micrometre, and 'nucleation_mode' aerosol particles, defined as having a diameter of less than 3 micrometres. I am not expert enough to advise on whether 'dust' would always be considered 'coarse' so I don't know whether it's necessary to include that in the name. Again we should write the name as a tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content for consistency with existing names. This would lead us to:
