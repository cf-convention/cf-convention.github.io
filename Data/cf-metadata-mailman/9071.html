Dear Jonathan and Elisa,
<br />
<br />Thank you, Jonathan, for commenting on the standard names proposed for Dynvar. I have followed your suggestion and added a definition for &quot;boundary_layer_mixing&quot;: ' &quot;Boundary layer mixing&quot; means turbulent motions that transport heat, water, momentum and chemical constituents within the atmospheric boundary layer and affect exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. The atmospheric boundary layer is typically characterised by a well-mixed sub-cloud layer of order 500 metres, and by a more extended conditionally unstable layer with boundary-layer clouds up to 2 km. (Reference: IPCC Third Assessment Report, Working Group 1: The Scientific Basis, 7.2.2.3, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/273.htm">https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/273.htm</a>).' I have also removed the unnecessary 'the' from the Eulerian mean advection names, as you suggest.
<br />
<br />No other comments have been received regarding these names, so they are now accepted and will be included in this week's standard name table update. Unless anyone objects, I will also add the boundary layer mixing definition to the 8 existing names at the next update.
<br />
<br />The Dynvar names are listed in full below.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

Subject: [CF-metadata] New standard names for Dynvar
<br />
<br />Dear Alison and Elisa
<br />
<br />These names generally look fine to me. Thanks. I have a couple of comments.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_downward_eastward_stress_due_to_boundary_layer_mixing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (canonical units: Pa) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_downward_northward_stress_due_to_boundary_layer_mixing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (canonical units: Pa)
</em><br />
<br />Could the definitions also contain a sentence to define &quot;boundary layer mixing&quot;
<br />
- I see that's a phrase which has been used before.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_advection_by_the_northward_transforme
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; d_eulerian_mean_air_velocity (canonical units: m s-2) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_advection_by_the_upward_transformed_e
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ulerian_mean_air_velocity (canonical units: m s-2)
</em><br />
<br />I would suggest leaving out _the_. It's better English, but not usual in CF standard names!
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
