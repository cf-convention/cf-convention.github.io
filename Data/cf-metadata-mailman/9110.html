Hi Martin,
<br />
<br />Regarding
<br />
<br />heat_flux_into_snow_and_ice_on_land_due_to_rainfall
<br />
<br />Does this leave some ambiguity?   I'm not positive about this, but won't a mass of anything falling onto the surface deposit both mass and energy (i.e., heat)?  Do we care about the enthalpy added in this way if it has no impact on the temperature of the surface?  Or are we only interested in the case that the temperature of the falling rain is different from the temperature of the surface (in which case it will change the surface temperature)?  I assumed the latter, and that's what I was trying to get at with &quot;added_at_a_different_temperature&quot;:
<br />
<br />&quot;heat_flux_into_snow_and_ice_on_land_due_to_rainfall_added_at_a_different_temperature&quot;?
<br />
<br />(I could be totally wrong about this.)
<br />
<br />best regards,
<br />
Karl

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Karl, Jonathan,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thank you, these are very relevant comments. I'm afraid I still can't find Jonathan's comments from Tuesday --- the email doesn't appear with the other mails of the thread in the list archives where I usually go to trace exchanges back.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jonathan makes a good point about the usage of &quot;assuming&quot;: I introduced the term into the thread, copying it from the existing help text for &quot;soil_albedo&quot;, and Alison referred to terms which use &quot;assuming&quot; in the standard name. As Jonathan says, there is a very specific interpretation when &quot;assuming&quot; is used in a standard name, so perhaps the soil_albedo help text should be modified to avoid confusion. &quot;soil_albedo&quot; could, I think, be replaced by surface albedo with area type bare_soil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Responding to Karl's comments:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) I had missed the fact that the CMIP5 evaporation variable, evs, adopted the broadest possible interpretation of the term. I agree that we should preserve this interpretation and that the proposed new variable for evapotranspiration is redundant. The fact that evs includes sublimation and transpiration is made clear in the CMIP5 variable tables, but the standard name water_evaporation_flux does not make any reference to the precise meaning of evaporation. The AMS glossary says that &quot;Evaporation is usually restricted in use to the change of water from liquid to gas&quot;: this does not rule out the possibility of using it in the broader sense, but it does suggest that there is liable to be confusion if we use the word without further clarification. I suggest introducing water_evapotranspiration_flux or water_total_evaporation_flux and demoting water_evaporation_flux to an alias, and also adding some explanatory text &quot;Evapotranspiration/Total evaporation refers to all water vapor fluxes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   from the surface: liquid evaporation, sublimation and transpiration&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy_due_to_interception (kg m-2 s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This may be obscure, and you are right to raise concerns about the precise meaning of &quot;canopy&quot; as opposed to vegetation. There are a number of terms related to water held on the &quot;canopy&quot;. My understanding is that the terminology comes from analysis of precipitation which lands on trees and is held away from the surface. The models are beginning to differentiate between water which falls directly on the surface and water held in the tree canopy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have an existing standard name canopy_height with the descriptive text: '&quot;Canopy&quot; means the plant or vegetation canopy', and this name is used with a CMIP6 variable for vegetation height and also for a specific variable for vegetation height in natural grasslands (with the area type natural_grasses). To my mind this usage (i.e. referring to the grass &quot;canopy&quot;), but it follows the CMIP5 usage in variables such as prveg (Precipitation onto Canopy: precipitation_flux_onto_canopy). It is also consistent with AMS, which considers canopy to be &quot;The vegetative covering over a surface&quot;, but also references an alternative usage as the upper portion of the vegetation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are 11 CF standard names referring to the canopy, including water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy. Following the discussion of &quot;water_evaporation_flux&quot;, the term &quot;water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy&quot; should include transpiration as well as evaporation/sublimation from any water sitting on the vegetation. The water sitting on the vegetation is referred to as intercepted, and it is the evaporation/sublimation of this intercepted water that is of interest here. LS3MIP will also be using the CMIP5 variable &quot;ec&quot; which gives the transpiration flux. There is an existing term canopy_water_amount to refer to this intercepted water, so perhaps it would be better to say: water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy_water.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the term canopy_water_amount, I think there is a real distinction between canopy and vegetation: canopy is referring to the above ground portion of the vegetation. The descriptive text could be clarified, but I think there is a case for retaining the term.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3) These are good points. I am also unfamiliar with the history of the term temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water --- the term we want here appears to be a close relative of that term, but I'm happy to consider other formulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because this is a heat flux across a surface I would prefer the form &quot;heat_flux_into_...&quot; rather than &quot;tendency_of_..._temperature_..._due_to_...&quot;, because the boundary flux is not a term in a temperature tendency equation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have responded to comments from Alison on the best way to refer to the body of snow and ice on land which is the recipient of the heat here -- my last suggestion was &quot;snow_and_ice_on_land&quot;, but that discussion is still open. Here, we could use &quot;heat_flux_into_snow_and_ice_on_land_due_to_rainfall&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (4) On reflection it may be clearer to say surface_upward_latent_heat_flux_due_to_sublimation, where it is clear that sublimation is a process and latent heat flux is a standard term.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Alison and Martin,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After a quick look through these very thorough notes, I noticed:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1)  &quot;evaporation&quot;:  In CMIP5 and in general up until now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  a)  &quot;water_evaporation_flux&quot; has included &quot;transpiration&quot; and included water_sublimation_flux from all parts of the surface (soil and vegetation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  b) &quot;water_sublimation_flux&quot; was restricted to water in solid form on the surface (or surface vegetation) that passed into the gaseous phase and entered the atmosphere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  c) we had no name for the &quot;liquid-only&quot; portion of water_evaporation_flux
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  d) we had no name for the &quot;transpiration-only&quot; portion of water_evaporation_flux.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we want to preserve these traditional definitions of water_evaporation_flux and water_sublimation_flux when defining components of them (e.g., portions originating from different parts of the surface and vegetation, or restricted to certain surface water phases)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main thing is that the water_evaporation_flux should be *all* the water vapor leaving the surface (and surface vegetatioin) and entering the atmosphere and water_sublimation_flux should be *all* the water vapor directly entering the atmosphere from solid water on the surface.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want to introduce &quot;evapotranspiration_flux&quot;, you would have to make &quot;water_evaporation_flux&quot; an alias.  It would be o.k. to define &quot;transpiration_flux&quot; as a new name identifying the portion of &quot;water_evaporation&quot; (i.e.,  &quot;evapotranspiration&quot;) that is due to transpiration.  I think it would be a mistake to change the meaning of water_evaporation_flux so that it excludes the portion due to transpiration.  water_evaporation_flux has been in use too long with the original meaning.  &quot;evapotranspiration&quot; is *not* a new concept in CF, it is a suggested new name for &quot;evaporation&quot;.  My vote would be *not* to replace &quot;evaporation&quot; with &quot;evapotranspiration&quot;; the atmosphere doesn't care that a portion of the evaporating water traveled through the plant roots and exited through stomata in the leaves; it still ends up in the atmosphere as vapor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2)  water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy_due_to_interception (kg m-2 s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  a) This seems quite obscure.  &quot;interception of what?&quot;  [snow fall, yes?]  Would water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy_snow work?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  b) How else does snow accumulate on the canopy except by falling as snow?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  c) It appears that &quot;evaporation&quot; here must surely include sublimation (as discussed in 1 above), which I think is good.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  d) Is there a precise definition of canopy?  How does it differ from &quot;vegetation&quot;?  A definition I found says &quot;The canopy refers to the highest layer of vegetation in a forest or woodland, made up of the crowns of its tallest trees.&quot;  I would be surprised if modelers are using the term in this sense. If &quot;canopy&quot; is restricted to &quot;trees&quot; (or tallest trees), how are they defined since some shrubs seem to have similar characteristics as trees.  Why would modelers want to isolate water evaporation from the canopy, rather than considering water evaporation from all the vegetation?  If &quot;canopy&quot; includes all vegetation that &quot;hides&quot; the surface soil from above, wouldn't all plants do that?  If so, why not just say &quot;vegetation&quot;  (meaning surface vegetation) and avoid use of &quot;canopy&quot; in standard names.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  e) In general the use of &quot;canopy&quot;,  I think, should be avoided unless a precise definition can be provided and either models or measurements actually keep track of what goes on there specifically.  If &quot;canopy&quot; means &quot;surface vegetation&quot;, I think the term &quot;vegetation&quot; would be much less misleading than the term &quot;canopy&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3)  I must have missed the discussion about this, but does temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make sense?  Our use of flux as a short-hand for &quot;flux density&quot; (as formally used in physics)  wouldn't seem to apply to &quot;temperature&quot;, which is a property of a material not something that can flow from one place to another.  Does it mean &quot;heat_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_rainfall_added_at_a_different_temperature&quot;?  Or is it the &quot;tendancy_of_sea_water_temperature_due_to_rainfall&quot;?  Or something else?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4)  I've never seen the term &quot;sublimation heat flux&quot; used, although I guess its meaning is clear enough.  Does anyone know of a different term meaning &quot;heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere due to sublimation of surface ice, frost, and snow?

This would be similar to the way in which we deprecated several surface_temperature_where_X names and made them all aliases of surface_temperature.

The surface temperature is the temperature at the interface, not the bulk temperature of the medium above or below. Unless indicated in the cell_methods attribute, a quantity is assumed to apply to the whole area of each horizontal grid box. Previously, the qualifier where_type was used to specify that the quantity applies only to the part of the grid box of the named type. Names containing the where_type qualifier are deprecated and newly created data should use the cell_methods attribute to indicate the horizontal area to which the quantity applies.' If we take a similar approach with the albedo names we should of course add the same recommendation to use cell_methods to indicate the horizontal area. We would then be able to have the albedo of any surface that is described in the area_type table without the need to add further standard names. Do others think that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   be a useful step?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we do go down the area_type route, I think we'd still need canopy_albedo as a separate name because it's clearly not the same as the surface, but that name  could also optionally be combined with an area_type of no_snow if only the albedo of snow free canopy where required.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regardless of whether we decide to introduce a new standard name or a new area type for the proposed quantity, we need a clear definition of which ice/snow areas are included and excluded. I wonder if excluding lake_ice from our definition of land_ice is a deliberate omission or an oversight? Can we check this point with the ISMIP6 group? Even if lake_ice is not included in land_ice, we do have an existing area_type lake_ice_or_sea_ice and we could introduce lake_ice as a distinct area_type in its own right. I think we'd also need a definition for land_snow, presumably something like ' &quot;Land snow' means any snow lying on the land surface, land ice or lake ice.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we use surface_albedo, then the area type for this quantity would need to be land_ice_and_lake_ice_or_land_snow or land_ice_or_land_snow, depending on whether lake_ice should be included in land_ice. If we introduce a new standard name the information would have to go in there: surface_albedo_assuming_land_ice_and_lake_ice_or_land_snow. Both approaches lead to quite a long string for the surface type, but I think that's the only way to be clear about the quantity that is being represented. We've used similar long strings for C4MIP names such as surface_upward_mass_flux_of_nitrous_oxide_expressed_as_nitrogen_out_of_vegetation_and_litter_and_soil.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The name itself does follow existing patterns and the units are correct for a heat flux. The existing temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water name is defined as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The quantity with standard name temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water is the heat energy carried by rainfall entering the sea at the sea surface. It is calculated relative to the heat that would be carried by rainfall entering the sea at zero degrees Celsius. It is calculated as the product QrainCpTrain, where Qrain is the mass flux of rainfall entering the sea (kg m-2 s-1), Cp is the specific heat capacity of water and Train is the temperature in degrees Celsius of the rain water entering the sea surface. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming that the proposed name would be defined similarly, it seems to me that this is another case where we could use area types. The energy being carried by the rainfall is essentially a surface flux - it depends on where the rain originated and the properties of the air it has fallen through, rather than the type of surface it is falling onto. I suggest we could make the existing name into an alias of temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux. We could then use this for both the original and proposed quantities if an appropriate area type is supplied. We already have an area type of sea. Is the proposed quantity like the albedo in proposal 1.2, i.e. does it mean land_ice_and_lake_ice_or_land_snow?

I suggest we call the proposed quantity mass_content_of_water_in_soil_layer_defined_by_root_depth. This is a bit like existing ocean_mixed_layer names, e.g., ocean_mixed_layer_thickness_defined_by_temperature.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are no usage of &quot;groundwater&quot; in existing CF terms, the following has been suggested in connection with the LS3MIP term dgw:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Groundwater is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures &gt; of rock formations.&quot;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there's a typo in the suggested units and it should say kg m-2 s-1.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking at existing names I see we also have surface_snow_sublimation_amount. Rather than talking about sublimation amount in one name and sublimation flux in others I think it would make sense to take a more uniform approach. I think the primary purpose of the existing surface_snow_and_ice_sublimation_flux name is to describe changes at the surface, rather than a water vapour flux into the atmosphere. Hence I suggest introducing aliases:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; liquid_water_mass_flux_into_soil_due_to_surface_snow_melt (kg m-2 s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a number of reasons for suggesting this. The existing surface_snow_melt_flux name isn't very clear in my opinion. It doesn't say where the flux is going (or even that it is a mass flux, although that is mentioned in the definition). It might even be better to change the existing name to something like tendency_of_surface_snow_amount_due_to_melting. The other reason I am suggesting a different form for the proposed quantity is because of the use of the phrase 'surface_snow' in standard names to mean snow lying on the surface. I think there's some potential for confusing surface_snow with a surface_flux (i.e. flux in or out of the atmosphere) when that clearly isn't intended. The definition would be as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. The phrase &quot;surface_snow&quot; means snow lying on the surface.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The sentence explaining that surface_snow means lying snow is new, but I think we should add it to all existing surface snow names. Do others agree?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This name is still under discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7.4 snwc    Snow intercepted by the vegetation   [kg m-2]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an existing term &quot;canopy_water_amount&quot;, hence:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   canopy_snow_amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the name and units are fine. The definition would be:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area. &quot;Canopy&quot; means the plant or vegetation canopy. The phrase &quot;canopy_snow&quot; means snow lying on the canopy.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This one is a straight forward addition to the standard name table. It is accepted for publication and will be added in the June update.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7.5 sw    Surface Water Storage (excluding snow) [kg m-2]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The existing term surface_water_amount refers to &quot;.. the amount on the ground, excluding that on the plant or vegetation canopy&quot;, and &quot;water&quot; is assumed to refer to all phases.  There is a term &quot;land_based_water_amount&quot; under discussion for PMIP which refers to &quot;This quantity is often known as Terrestrial Water Storage. It includes surface water (water in rivers, wetlands, lakes, snow, vegetation and reservoirs) and subsurface water (soil moisture, groundwater)&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming that this term is intended to be a variation on the first, surface_water_amount, and the amount includes only liquid phase water (excluding snow and ice):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_liquid_water_amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I note that the PMIP name you refer to is currently listed as land_water_amount. Given that this variable is related and is clearly limited to surface water on land (i.e. it excludes surface sea water) I suggest:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; land_surface_liquid_water_amount (kg m-2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area. The quantity with standard name land_surface_liquid_water_amount includes water in rivers, wetlands, lakes, snow, vegetation and reservoirs.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am aware that there is still some work being done on clarifying the definition of land water and we will need to wait for the outcome of that before we can finalise this name.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This name is still under discussion.
