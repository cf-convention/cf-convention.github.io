Dear Martin and Alison
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_downward_sensible_heat_flux_due_to_rainfall_temperature_anomaly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The rainfall temperature anomaly is the temperature of the snow relative to the zero Celsius. The sensible heat flux due the rainfall temperature anomaly is the product of three terms: the rainfall mass flux, the specific heat capacity of the rain and the temperature anomaly.
</em><br />
<br />I following your reasoning and thanks for the explanation. I don't like
<br />
&quot;temperature flux&quot; either. (In oceanography, I don't like the concept itself,
<br />
because the zero of temperature is arbitrary, and a temperature flux tells
<br />
you nothing about heat convergence.) To me &quot;sensible heat flux&quot; doesn't seem
<br />
right for this quantity, because that term is always used for turbulent heat
<br />
fluxes in air. This is a bit different.  Also, &quot;anomaly&quot; isn't right, because
<br />
we use this to mean a difference from climatology. I would therefore favour
<br />
being more explicit, and more closely related to the description of the
<br />
proposers, which refers specifically to rainfall onto snow. What about
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;heat_flux_into_surface_snow_due_to_rainfall_temperature
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5. River in- and out-flow [2]

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; inward_water_volume_transport_in_river_channel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outward_water_volume_transport_in_river_channel
</em><br />
<br />It's good to base them on existing names, but I don't follow why you think
<br />
from_upstream and to_downstream don't work. If we are thinking of a cell, or
<br />
in non-model terms some body of water like a lake, the inflow is necessarily
<br />
from upstream, and the outflow is to downstream. That's the way gravity works.
<br />
:-)
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3.1 hfrs    Heat transferred to snowpack by rainfall   [W m-2]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have heard back from Hyungjun Kim, and this term should represent the same thermodynamic quantity as the variable hfrainds, which was in CMIP5 with temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water.  The definition of this CF term, which Alison has copied into the discussion below, make it clear that it relates to the flux of sensible heat (i.e. thermal energy) associated with the a temperature anomaly relative to zero Celsius. The fact that it is not the full thermal energy of the rain drops, but only an anomaly component evidently makes the naming harder. The phrase &quot;temperature flux&quot; appears to come from some work by Stommel, who made use of a related term, albeit with different units. I agree with Karl that it is not a very helpful term here, and it would be even more unhelpful if we take it out of the oceanography context and into a land snow term.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oceanographers refer to the &quot;temperature anomaly relative to zero Celsius&quot; as &quot;the temperature in units of degrees Celsius&quot;, which is obviously correct -- up to a point, yet, in an obscure way, not quite right when transplanted into the CF list and the mandated adoption of the UNIDATA interpretation of units. Converting &quot;emperature in units of degrees Celsius&quot; to Kelvin gives a different answer to converting &quot;temperature anomaly relative to zero Celsius&quot; to Kelvin: here we want the latter, so it is important to be explicit that we are talking about a temperature anomaly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The word &quot;anomaly&quot; is most often used in the CF standard names to refer to an anomaly relative to climatology, but I think we can use it for an anomaly relative to 0 degC -- unless there is a better word?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence, I suggest:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_downward_sensible_heat_flux_due_to_rainfall_temperature_anomaly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The rainfall temperature anomaly is the temperature of the snow relative to the zero Celsius. The sensible heat flux due the rainfall temperature anomaly is the product of three terms: the rainfall mass flux, the specific heat capacity of the rain and the temperature anomaly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the term hfrs this should be used with area type snow. The name temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water could be aliased to this new term, and hfrainds would then need to use area type ice free sea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 5. River in- and out-flow [2]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; river_water_volume_transport_into_cell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; river_water_volume_transport_out_of_cell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jonathan has suggested using &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;downstream&quot; instead of into/out_of cell ... to avoid making the term specific to model grid cells. I don't think that will work here. The key concept is flow inwards vs. flow outwards across the boundary of the cell. It could be expressed relative to a region which defaults to the grid cell. But the terms could be expressed in a more generic way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also notice that we already have a CF term water_volume_transport_in_river_channel which we should perhaps adapt here. We could also follow the convention established for upward/downward and put the directional modifier in front of the term being modified. hence:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inward_water_volume_transport_in_river_channel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outward_water_volume_transport_in_river_channel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;An inward flux or transport is the sum of all transport that is directed inwards across the boundary of an area. By default the area is a model grid cell, but other areas may be specified using a region coordinate&quot; , and similar for outward.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I can see that the first of these terms might be misread as transport *into* the rive channel, rather than transport *in* the channel. Any other suggestions?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Martin, Karl and Jonathan,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wrote most of this email late on Friday evening, before Martin and Karl?s comments over the weekend. However, I think it is largely consistent with the later discussion. I have amended my comments on the evaporation (2.1, 2.2), evapotranspiration (2.3) and heat flux into snow pack (3) names to reflect the latest position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks all for the very quick and helpful responses. I think we are making good progress on these names. Jonathan, I?m afraid I haven?t seen your comments from earlier last week ? they don?t seem to have appeared on the mailing list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These proposals have raised a number of  important questions. I?ll try to address the broad issues first before going through the names again in turn.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. ?Canopy? versus ?Vegetation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the context of discussing canopy evaporation/sublimation, Karl wrote the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Is there a precise definition of canopy?How does it differ from &quot;vegetation&quot;?A definition I found says &quot;The canopy refers to the highest layer of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; vegetation in a forest or woodland, made up of the crowns of its tallest trees.&quot; I would be surprised if modelers are using the term in this sense. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;canopy&quot; is restricted to &quot;trees&quot; (or tallest trees), how are they defined since some shrubs seem to have similar characteristics as trees.Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would modelers want to isolate water evaporation from the canopy, rather than considering water evaporation from all the vegetation?If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;canopy&quot; includes all vegetation that &quot;hides&quot; the surface soil from above, wouldn't all plants do that?If so, why not just say &quot;vegetation&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (meaning surface vegetation) and avoid use of &quot;canopy&quot; in standard names.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The AMS Glossary entry for ?canopy? says: ?The vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation, and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy.? I think this is consistent with Karl?s interpretation. Certainly I think the existing names don?t mean only the tops of trees, rather ?canopy? has indeed been used as short hand for ?the parts of plants that protrude into the air and prevent light and precipitation from reaching the surface directly?.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We use ?vegetation? in standard names such as carbon_mass_flux_into_soil_from_vegetation_excluding_litter where it can mean any part of the plant, including roots. ?Vegetation? is also used as an area type. Thus I think canopy does have a more specific meaning. I suggest that we replace the current not very helpful definition of canopy: ?&quot;Canopy&quot; means the plant or vegetation canopy? with the one from the AMS Glossary, but that we retain it as a separate term.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Albedo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jonathan has pointed out that an albedo of a particular surface type such as ?ice? is not the same as an albedo assuming_condition because the former is an observable surface characteristic while the latter is purely a model construct. This is a good point ? thank you. I agree that we should retain surface_albedo_assuming_deep_snow and surface_albedo_assuming_no_snow as separate quantities. However, I think we are agreed that we should have a single surface_albedo name and use area_types in the circumstances where the surface type truly is different and no additional conditions are being assumed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Evaporation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Karl made some important points about the definition of evaporation, evapotranspiration and sublimation. Clearly we need to remain consistent with previous usage of these terms - I have taken this into account in my comments on some of the individual names.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1.1 albc    Canopy Albedo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; canopy_albedo (1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Canopy&quot; means the plant or vegetation canopy. Albedo is the ratio of outgoing to incoming shortwave irradiance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we are all agreed that canopy_albedo should be a separate standard name and certainly it is different from a surface albedo. Using the updated definition of canopy we would now have:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?Albedo is the ratio of outgoing to incoming shortwave irradiance. ?Canopy? means the vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation, and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy. Reference: AMS Glossary <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy">http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy</a>.?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This name is still under discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1.2 albsn    Snow and Ice Albedo    [1]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Albedo of snow and ice covered surface.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; snow_and_ice_albedo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Snow and ice albedo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; -- OR --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This could be handled with existing name surface_albedo and a new area type &quot;snow_or_ice&quot;. [Note that &quot;landice&quot; appears to exclude ice on lakes, which may be a significant component of this albedo]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we are agreed now to use the existing surface_albedo name for this quantity. The definition would be amended to read as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. Albedo is the ratio of outgoing to incoming shortwave irradiance. To specify the nature of the surface a cell_methods attribute should be supplied as described in Chapter 7.3.3 of the CF Conventions.?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In addition we would introduce two new area_types as suggested by Martin:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ice_on_land
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?The area type ice_on_land means Ice in glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets &amp; shelves, river and lake ice, and any other ice on a land surface, such as frozen flood water. This is distinct from the area type ?land ice? which has a narrower definition.?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The combined term could be ice_and_snow_on_land
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?The area type ice_and_snow_on_land means ice in glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets &amp; shelves, river and lake ice, any other ice on a land surface, such as frozen flood water,  and snow lying on such ice or on the land surface.?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are these definitions okay?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This name is still under discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2. Evaporation and transpiration fluxes [3] Variations on the theme of the existing water_evaporation_flux term.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2.1 ec  water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy_due_to_interception (kg m-2 s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ' &quot;Water&quot; means water in all phases. Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone into vapor is called &gt; &quot;sublimation&quot;.) In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Canopy&quot; means the plant or vegetation canopy. &quot;Canopy interception&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the precipitation, including snow, that is intercepted by the canopy of a tree and then evaporates from the leaves.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Karl wrote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a) This seems quite obscure.&quot;interception of what?&quot;[snow fall,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; yes?]Would water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy_snow work?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; b) How else does snow accumulate on the canopy except by falling as snow?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Naively, I would have thought that both rain and snow could be intercepted. Some of the rain will drip from the leaves onto the ground, while some will sit on the leaves as water droplets and eventually evaporate into the air. Certainly some snowfall would also be intercepted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; c) It appears that &quot;evaporation&quot; here must surely include sublimation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (as discussed in 1 above), which I think is good.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Certainly the definition as given above does include sublimation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Karl makes the point that in CMIP5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a) &quot;water_evaporation_flux&quot; has included &quot;transpiration&quot; and included
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; water_sublimation_flux from all parts of the surface (soil and vegetation)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that it is important we do not alter or confuse this interpretation in the current set of proposals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand the proposed quantity to mean the evaporation (including sublimation) of any precipitation that falls and comes to rest on the canopy. I think it doesn?t include transpiration, nor does it include evaporation from the ground. We do have existing names canopy_water_amount and change_over_time_in_canopy_water_amount. Following this pattern, perhaps we could call the proposed quantity:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_canopy_water_amount_due_to_evaporation_of_intercepted_precipitation (kg m-2 s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area. &quot;Water&quot; means water in all phases. ?Canopy? means the vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation, and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy. Reference: AMS Glossary <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy">http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy</a>.? The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.  &quot;Intercepted precipitation&quot; is the precipitation, including snow, that is intercepted by the vegetation canopy and then evaporates without ever reaching the surface or entering the plant through its roots. Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone i</em><br />
nto vapor is called &quot;sublimation&quot;.) Evaporation of intercepted precipitation excludes plant transpiration and evaporation from the surface beneath the canopy.?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In view of this, Martin has suggested that we should make the existing water_evaporation_flux name into an alias of water_evapotranspiration_flux and adding to the definition. I agree this would be a very good step. So then we would have:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water_evapotranspiration_flux
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?Water means water in all phases. ?Evapotranspiration? means all water vapor fluxes from the surface: liquid evaporation, sublimation and transpiration.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone into vapor is called &quot;sublimation&quot;.) Transpiration is the process by which water is carried from the roots of plants and evaporates from the stomata.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Keeping  the reference to cell_methods in the definition is useful because it potentially allows the use of area type to describe evapotranspiration from different types of vegetation in a single grid box, even if there is no requirement to do that at the moment.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Taking this approach of having separate surface evaporation and evapotranspiration fluxes in proposals 2.2 and 2.3 seems to me the tidiest and least confusing way of accommodating the CMIP6 quantities while not introducing inconsistencies with CMIP5. I note that this does raise an interesting wrinkle as regards aliases: currently water_evaporation_flux has an alias of water_evaporation_flux_where_sea_ice which clearly would not include vegetated areas and is therefore more akin to the surface_water_evaporation_flux name  I am now suggesting for 2.2. I think it makes sense to list water_evaporation_flux_where_sea_ice as an alias of surface_water_evaporation_flux, rather than water_evapotranspiration_flux. We have never ?transferred? an alias in this way before, but I think it is the best approach to preserving the meaning of all the terms, past and present. Do others agree?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The quantity with standard name temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water is the heat energy carried by rainfall entering the sea at the sea surface.

It is calculated as the product QrainCpTrain, where Qrain is the mass flux of rainfall entering the sea (kg m-2 s-1), Cp is the specific heat capacity of water and Train is the temperature in degrees Celsius of the rain water entering the sea surface. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.'

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it is a heat flux, but a relative one.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 7.5 sw    Surface Water Storage (excluding snow) [kg m-2]

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The existing term surface_water_amount refers to &quot;.. the amount on the ground, excluding that on the plant or vegetation canopy&quot;, and

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;water&quot; is assumed to refer to all phases.  There is a term &quot;land_based_water_amount&quot; under discussion for PMIP which refers to &quot;This

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quantity is often known as Terrestrial Water Storage. It includes surface water (water in rivers, wetlands, lakes, snow, vegetation and

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Assuming that this term is intended to be a variation on the first, surface_water_amount, and the amount includes only liquid phase water

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; surface_liquid_water_amount
