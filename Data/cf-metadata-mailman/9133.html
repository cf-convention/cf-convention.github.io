Hello,
<br />
<br />Due to the continuing, external issues with Trac site (we can see it, but
<br />
not yet login), I am posting this ticket to the mailing list because I
<br />
would very much like to make it available before next week's meeting
<br />
&lt;<a href="https://www.ncas.ac.uk/en/conferencesandworkshops/2018cfworkshop">https://www.ncas.ac.uk/en/conferencesandworkshops/2018cfworkshop</a>&gt;, where
<br />
it will be discussed.
<br />
<br />When Trac is fully functional again (many thanks to Jeff and Brian for
<br />
working hard on this over the last week), I shall copy what follows into a
<br />
normal new ticket.
<br />
<br />All the best,
<br />
<br />David
<br />
<br /><br />New ticket (enhancement)
<br />
========================
<br />
<br />Incorporating the CF data model into the conventions
<br />
----------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />In this ticket we propose that a CF data model for data and metadata
<br />
corresponding to the existing standard (version 1.7) is incorporated into
<br />
the CF conventions. As a netCDF convention, up to now the CF standard has
<br />
not included a data model. However, the design of CF implies a data model
<br />
to some extent and defining an explicit data model will contribute to the
<br />
CF goal to help in &quot;building applications with powerful extraction,
<br />
regridding, and display capabilities&quot;.
<br />
<br />A data model is an abstract interpretation of the data that identifies the
<br />
elements of the dataset and their scientific intent, and describes how they
<br />
are related to one another and to the real or model world from which the
<br />
data were derived. A data model is necessary because it imposes the rules,
<br />
constraints, and relationships connecting metadata to the data that are
<br />
needed to imagine how the quantities included in the dataset should be
<br />
combined and processed scientifically.
<br />
<br />Following discussions at the 2017 netCDF-CF meeting, we propose that the CF
<br />
data model that was recently published in the Geoscientific Model
<br />
Development journal (GMD) (<a href="https://www.geosci-model-dev">https://www.geosci-model-dev</a>.
<br />
net/10/4619/2017/gmd-10-4619-2017.pdf) be formally incorporated into the CF
<br />
conventions as an independent element of CF, separate from the CF standards
<br />
and conformance documents, to be updated for successive CF versions in line
<br />
with those documents.
<br />
<br />The data model published in GMD was for CF-1.6, but it is consistent with
<br />
all of the changes to the conventions arising from the 28 tickets that
<br />
contributed to CF-1.7. Therefore we may consider this also to be the data
<br />
model for CF version 1.7.
<br />
<br />We propose a new document for the CF data model and have produced a draft
<br />
of this (attached) that describes the data model, with associated UML
<br />
(Unified Modelling Language) diagrams to illustrate it. The description
<br />
follows closely from the text and diagrams of the GMD paper, which in turn
<br />
grew out of the discussions in tickets #68
<br />
&lt;<a href="https://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/68">https://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/68</a>&gt;, #88
<br />
&lt;<a href="https://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/88">https://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/88</a>&gt;, #95
<br />
&lt;<a href="https://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/95">https://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/95</a>&gt; and #107
<br />
&lt;<a href="https://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/107">https://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/107</a>&gt;. The new document also describes
<br />
how the data model is implemented in netCDF, but this is not part of the
<br />
data model itself, as the same data model could be implemented in other
<br />
non-netCDF-like file formats.
<br />
<br />The CF data model overlaps with other work on data models, especially the
<br />
Unidata CDM. How the CF data model relates to other data models is not
<br />
required as part of the conventions, and so does not appear as part of this
<br />
proposal, but is discussed in the GMD paper.
<br />
<br />Governance
<br />
----------
<br />
<br />The CF data model will have to adapt to future enhancements to the
<br />
conventions, and therefore must be considered when changes to the
<br />
conventions are proposed. To ensure that this occurs, we suggest the
<br />
following guidelines to be added to the end of the existing &quot;Rules for CF
<br />
Conventions Changes &lt;<a href="http://cfconventions.org/rules.html">http://cfconventions.org/rules.html</a>&gt;&quot; document:
<br />
<br />* The CF data model will guide the development of CF by providing a
<br />
framework for ensuring that proposed changes fit into CF in a logical way,
<br />
rather than just a pragmatic one.
<br />
<br />* All new proposals will be assessed to see if the new features defined in
<br />
the proposal map onto the CF data model.
<br />
<br />* The assessment will be carried out by a member of the conventions
<br />
committee or another suitably qualified person. If no-one volunteers, the
<br />
chairman of the committee will ask someone to do it.
<br />
<br />* If the proposal maps onto the existing CF data model then no further
<br />
action is required.
<br />
<br />* Otherwise an attempt must be made to modify the proposal so that its new
<br />
features do map onto the CF data model, and in such a way that the
<br />
proposal's intent is not compromised.
<br />
<br />* If the proposal cannot be acceptably modified to conform to the existing
<br />
data model, then the data model will need to be modified to accommodate the
<br />
new features. This modification will be either backwards compatible or
<br />
backwards incompatible. The former (preferable) case occurs if the data
<br />
model may be extended or generalised in some way that allows the new
<br />
features but does not affect its existing constructs and relationships.
<br />
<br />* Any changes to the data model must be described verbatim as part of the
<br />
proposal discussion, including any modified or new data model diagrams.
