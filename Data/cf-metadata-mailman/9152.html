Dear Martin,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your reply. Please see below for my suggestions for resolving the remaining names in this discussion. I think we are getting very close now!
<br />
<br />1.1 canopy_albedo (1)
<br />
'Albedo is the ratio of outgoing to incoming shortwave irradiance, where 'shortwave irradiance' means that both the incoming and outgoing radiation are integrated across the solar spectrum. &quot;Canopy&quot; means the vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy. Reference: AMS Glossary <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy">http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy</a>. The surface_albedo restricted to area type vegetation is related to canopy_albedo, but the former also includes the effect of radiation being reflected from the ground underneath the canopy.'
<br />
<br />I have added your suggested sentence regarding the relationship to surface_albedo to the definition. I have also slightly extended the definition of 'albedo' to be consistent with my most recent posting in the RFMIP thread. Whatever we agree about albedo in that discussion should apply equally to the LS3MIP names and vice versa.
<br />
<br />Okay?
<br />
<br />1.2 albsn    Snow and Ice Albedo
<br />
<br />We have agreed to use the existing surface_albedo name. The definition will be updated to reflect (no pun intended!) the outcome of the albedo discussion in 1.1 and RFMIP.
<br />
<br />I think we are agreed on the following two new area types:
<br />
ice_on_land
<br />
The area type ice_on_land means Ice in glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets &amp; shelves, river and lake ice, and any other ice on a land surface, such as frozen flood water. This is distinct from the area type 'land ice' which has a narrower definition.'
<br />
<br />ice_and_snow_on_land
<br />
The area type ice_and_snow_on_land means ice in glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets &amp; shelves, river and lake ice, any other ice on a land surface, such as frozen flood water,  and snow lying on such ice or on the land surface.'
<br />
<br />These two area types are accepted and will be added to the area type table on 2nd July, alongside the standard name table update.
<br />
<br />2.1 ec  water_evaporation_flux_from_canopy_due_to_interception (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
<br />I think we are now agreed on:
<br />
tendency_of_canopy_water_amount_due_to_evaporation_of_intercepted_precipitation (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area. &quot;Water&quot; means water in all phases. &quot;Canopy&quot; means the vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation, and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy. Reference: AMS Glossary <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy">http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy</a>.' The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.  &quot;Intercepted precipitation&quot; is the precipitation, including snow, that is intercepted by the vegetation canopy and then evaporates without ever reaching the surface or entering the plant through its roots. Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone int<br />
o vapor is called &quot;sublimation&quot;.) Evaporation of intercepted precipitation excludes plant transpiration and evaporation from the surface beneath the canopy.'
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for publication in the standard name table and will be added in the 2nd July update.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.1 eow    Open Water Evaporation    [kg m-2 s-1]
</em><br />
<br />I think we are agreed on:
<br />
surface_water_evaporation_flux (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
'Water means water in all phases. Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone into vapor is called &quot;sublimation&quot;.) The quantity with standard name surface_water_evaporation_flux does not include transpiration from vegetation. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. Unless indicated in the cell_methods attribute, a quantity is assumed to apply to the whole area of each horizontal grid box. Previously, the qualifier where_type was used to specify that the quantity applies only to the part of the grid box of the named type. Names containing the where_type qualifier are deprecated and newly created data should use the cell_methods attribute to indicate the horizontal area to which the quantity applies.'
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for publication in the standard name table and will be added in the 2nd July update.
<br />
<br />I think we are agreed on the new area type:
<br />
fresh_free_water
<br />
'An area type of fresh_free_water means a free interface between freshwater and the atmosphere without vegetation or other obstructions.'
<br />
<br />This area type is accepted and will be added to the area type table on 2nd July, alongside the standard name table update.
<br />
<br />2.3 et    Total Evapotranspiration    [kg m-2 s-1]
<br />
We have agreed to create the following alias:
<br />
water_evaporation_flux -&gt; water_evapotranspiration_flux (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
' Water means water in all phases. &quot;Evapotranspiration&quot; means all water vapor fluxes from the surface: liquid evaporation, sublimation and transpiration. Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone into vapor is called &quot;sublimation&quot;.) Transpiration is the process by which water is carried from the roots of plants and evaporates from the stomata. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. Unless indicated in the cell_methods attribute, a quantity is assumed to apply to the whole area of each horizontal grid box.'
<br />
<br />This change will be added to the standard name table in the 2nd July update.
<br />
<br />3.1 hfrs Heat transferred to snowpack by rainfall [W m-2]
<br />
<br />Martin has suggested the following:
<br />
surface_downward_sensible_heat_flux_due_to_rainfall_temperature_anomaly
<br />
The rainfall temperature anomaly is the temperature of the snow relative to the zero Celsius. The sensible heat flux due the rainfall temperature anomaly is the product of three terms: the rainfall mass flux, the specific heat capacity of the rain and the temperature anomaly.
<br />
<br />I certainly prefer this term to having a temperature flux! We define 'anomaly' in existing names as follows: 'The term &quot;anomaly&quot; means difference from climatology' so I think it would be misleading to use the same term here. We have one existing name that refers to a temperature 'excess' - 
<br />
integral_wrt_time_of_air_temperature_excess where excess is calculated relative to a threshold specified in a coordinate variable. Perhaps we could call this quantity:
<br />
surface_downward_sensible_heat_flux_due_to_rainfall_temperature_excess_above_freezing
<br />
or just surface_downward_sensible_heat_flux_due_to_rainfall_temperature_excess and put the datum in a coordinate variable as for the existing name.
<br />
<br />For the first suggestion the definition would be:
<br />
'The quantity with standard name surface_downward_sensible_heat_flux_due_to_rainfall_temperature_excess_above_freezing is the heat energy carried by rainfall reaching the surface. It is calculated relative to the heat that would be carried by rainfall reaching the surface at zero degrees Celsius. It is calculated as the product QrainCpTrain, where Qrain is the mass flux of rainfall reaching the surface (kg m-2 s-1), Cp is the specific heat capacity of water and Train is the temperature in degrees Celsius of the rain water reaching the surface. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.'
<br />
<br />What do you think?
<br />
<br />I agree with your suggestion of making the existing temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water into an alias of this one and using area types of sea and snow for the different CMIP variables.
<br />
<br />5. Regarding the river transport names, I did in fact publish them in Version 55 of the standard name table as river_water_volume_transport_into_cell and river_water_volume_transport_out_of_cell, so if we now decide on one of the other options we will need to create aliases. I don't have very strong feelings about any of the variations that have been put forward, but if we are to avoid the mention of cells then perhaps we could have:
<br />
inward_water_volume_transport_within_river_channel
<br />
outward_water_volume_transport_within_river_channel
<br />
i.e. saying 'within' channel so that people won't mistake it for flow into or out of the channel itself. This is also very general because it avoids assumptions about what is upstream or downstream. We can write the definition as:
<br />
' &quot;An inward|outward flux or transport is the sum of all transport that is directed inwards|outwards across the boundary of an area. &quot;River&quot; refers to water in the fluvial system (stream and floodplain). The horizontal domain over which the quantity is calculated is described by the associated coordinate variables and coordinate bounds or by a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with the standard name of &quot;region&quot; supplied according to section 6.1.1 of the CF conventions.'
<br />
This is the way we describe the horizontal areas used in calculating variables like land_ice_mass, for example. Is this okay?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7. Water fluxes [5]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7.1 qgwr    Groundwater recharge from soil layer    [kg m-1 s-1]
</em><br />
<br />Currently this name is listed as follows:
<br />
liquid_water_mass_flux_from_soil_to_groundwater (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
<br />We have now received clarification of how various parts of the land liquid water and ice budget are calculated, which I copy below so that we have a record in this public discussion:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) If we preferentially focus on mass balance, it would be straightforward to have:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      + soil moisture : total water in soil column
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     + water table depth : depth of saturation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     + groundwater recharge : water flux at water table (which should be base flow if water table depth is lower than model soil depth)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) In terrestrial hydrology, cold processes and associated storage are treated with liquid phase processes in general.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore, it would be more useful to have them in separated variables.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) I mostly agree with you suggestion, but because of reason 2), it would be better to be defined as (although it is same to yours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physically) summation of:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     + liquid phase surface water (water in rivers, wetlands, lakes, vegetation, reservoirs, canopy interception)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     + snow (&amp;canopy interception), and ice, including grounded ice sheets and ice on lakes etc, but excluding ice shelves floating in sea water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     + liquid subsurface water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;    + solid subsurface water
</em><br />
Many thanks to Hyungjun Kim for clarifying these important questions.
<br />
<br />Based on Hyungjun's explanation, I suggest the definition of the groundwater recharge quantity should be as follows:
<br />
downward_liquid_water_mass_flux_into_groundwater (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
'In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. Groundwater is subsurface water below the depth of the water table. The quantity with standard name liquid_water_mass_flux_from_soil_to_groundwater is the downward flux of liquid water within soil at the depth of the water table, or downward flux from the base of the soil model if the water table depth is greater.'
<br />
<br />(In this I have simplified the definition of groundwater to just 'Groundwater is subsurface water below the depth of the water table.')
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7.5 sw    Surface Water Storage (excluding snow) [kg m-2]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The existing term surface_water_amount refers to &quot;.. the amount on the ground, excluding that on the plant or vegetation canopy&quot;, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;water&quot; is assumed to refer to all phases.  There is a term &quot;land_based_water_amount&quot; under discussion for PMIP which refers to &quot;This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity is often known as Terrestrial Water Storage. It includes surface water (water in rivers, wetlands, lakes, snow, vegetation and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  reservoirs) and subsurface water (soil moisture, groundwater)&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming that this term is intended to be a variation on the first, surface_water_amount, and the amount includes only liquid phase water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (excluding snow and ice):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_liquid_water_amount
</em><br />
<br />This name is currently listed as:
<br />
land_surface_liquid_water_amount (kg m-2)
<br />
'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area. The quantity with standard name land_surface_liquid_water_amount includes water in rivers, wetlands, lakes, reservoirs and liquid precipitation intercepted by the vegetation canopy.'
<br />
<br />This is consistent with Hyungjun's description of liquid phase surface water. Okay?
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

Subject: Re: Final 17 terms for CMIP6 LS3MIP.
<br />
<br />Dear Alison,
<br />
<br />That looks good. I agree with your suggestions, and have a few comments here. 
<br />
<br />1.1 albc Canopy Albedo
<br />
<br />I think it is worth adding an additional sentence explicitly stating the difference between canopy_albedo and the closely related concept of surface_albedo with area type vegetation: &quot;The surface_albedo restricted to area type vegetation is related to canopy_albedo, but the former also includes the effect of radiation being reflected from the ground underneath the canopy.&quot;
<br />
<br />3.1 hfrs Heat transferred to snowpack by rainfall [W m-2]
<br />
<br />I have heard back from Hyungjun Kim, and this term should represent the same thermodynamic quantity as the variable hfrainds, which was in CMIP5 with temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water. The definition of this CF term, which Alison has copied into the discussion below, make it clear that it relates to the flux of sensible heat (i.e. thermal energy) associated with the a temperature anomaly relative to zero Celsius. The fact that it is not the full thermal energy of the rain drops, but only an anomaly component evidently makes the naming harder. The phrase &quot;temperature flux&quot; appears to come from some work by Stommel, who made use of a related term, albeit with different units. I agree with Karl that it is not a very helpful term here, and it would be even more unhelpful if we take it out of the oceanography context and into a land snow term. 
<br />
<br />Oceanographers refer to the &quot;temperature anomaly relative to zero Celsius&quot; as &quot;the temperature in units of degrees Celsius&quot;, which is obviously correct -- up to a point, yet, in an obscure way, not quite right when transplanted into the CF list and the mandated adoption of the UNIDATA interpretation of units. Converting &quot;emperature in units of degrees Celsius&quot; to Kelvin gives a different answer to converting &quot;temperature anomaly relative to zero Celsius&quot; to Kelvin: here we want the latter, so it is important to be explicit that we are talking about a temperature anomaly. 
<br />
<br />The word &quot;anomaly&quot; is most often used in the CF standard names to refer to an anomaly relative to climatology, but I think we can use it for an anomaly relative to 0 degC -- unless there is a better word?
<br />
<br />Hence, I suggest:
<br />
surface_downward_sensible_heat_flux_due_to_rainfall_temperature_anomaly
<br />
The rainfall temperature anomaly is the temperature of the snow relative to the zero Celsius. The sensible heat flux due the rainfall temperature anomaly is the product of three terms: the rainfall mass flux, the specific heat capacity of the rain and the temperature anomaly.
<br />
<br />For the term hfrs this should be used with area type snow. The name temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water could be aliased to this new term, and hfrainds would then need to use area type ice free sea.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5. River in- and out-flow [2]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; river_water_volume_transport_into_cell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; river_water_volume_transport_out_of_cell
</em><br />
<br />Jonathan has suggested using &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;downstream&quot; instead of into/out_of cell ... to avoid making the term specific to model grid cells. I don't think that will work here. The key concept is flow inwards vs. flow outwards across the boundary of the cell. It could be expressed relative to a region which defaults to the grid cell. But the terms could be expressed in a more generic way. 
<br />
<br />I also notice that we already have a CF term water_volume_transport_in_river_channel which we should perhaps adapt here. We could also follow the convention established for upward/downward and put the directional modifier in front of the term being modified. hence:
<br />
inward_water_volume_transport_in_river_channel
<br />
outward_water_volume_transport_in_river_channel
<br />
<br />&quot;An inward flux or transport is the sum of all transport that is directed inwards across the boundary of an area. By default the area is a model grid cell, but other areas may be specified using a region coordinate&quot; , and similar for outward.
<br />
<br />However, I can see that the first of these terms might be misread as transport *into* the rive channel, rather than transport *in* the channel. Any other suggestions?
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
Martin

Subject: RE: Final 17 terms for CMIP6 LS3MIP. 
<br />
Dear Martin, Karl and Jonathan,
<br />
<br />I wrote most of this email late on Friday evening, before Martin and Karl's comments over the weekend. However, I think it is largely consistent with the later discussion. I have amended my comments on the evaporation (2.1, 2.2), evapotranspiration (2.3) and heat flux into snow pack (3) names to reflect the latest position.
<br />
<br />Thanks all for the very quick and helpful responses. I think we are making good progress on these names. Jonathan, I'm afraid I haven't seen your comments from earlier last week - they don't seem to have appeared on the mailing list.
<br />
<br />These proposals have raised a number of important questions. I'll try to address the broad issues first before going through the names again in turn.
<br />
<br />1. 'Canopy' versus 'Vegetation'
<br />
<br />In the context of discussing canopy evaporation/sublimation, Karl wrote the following:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there a precise definition of canopy?How does it differ from &quot;vegetation&quot;?A definition I found says &quot;The canopy refers to the highest layer of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vegetation in a forest or woodland, made up of the crowns of its tallest trees.&quot; I would be surprised if modelers are using the term in this sense. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;canopy&quot; is restricted to &quot;trees&quot; (or tallest trees), how are they defined since some shrubs seem to have similar characteristics as trees.Why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would modelers want to isolate water evaporation from the canopy, rather than considering water evaporation from all the vegetation?If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;canopy&quot; includes all vegetation that &quot;hides&quot; the surface soil from above, wouldn't all plants do that?If so, why not just say &quot;vegetation&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (meaning surface vegetation) and avoid use of &quot;canopy&quot; in standard names.
</em><br />
<br />The AMS Glossary entry for 'canopy' says: 'The vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation, and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy.' I think this is consistent with Karl's interpretation. Certainly I think the existing names don't mean only the tops of trees, rather 'canopy' has indeed been used as short hand for 'the parts of plants that protrude into the air and prevent light and precipitation from reaching the surface directly'.
<br />
<br />We use 'vegetation' in standard names such as carbon_mass_flux_into_soil_from_vegetation_excluding_litter where it can mean any part of the plant, including roots. 'Vegetation' is also used as an area type. Thus I think canopy does have a more specific meaning. I suggest that we replace the current not very helpful definition of canopy: '&quot;Canopy&quot; means the plant or vegetation canopy' with the one from the AMS Glossary, but that we retain it as a separate term.
<br />
<br />2. Albedo
<br />
Jonathan has pointed out that an albedo of a particular surface type such as 'ice' is not the same as an albedo assuming_condition because the former is an observable surface characteristic while the latter is purely a model construct. This is a good point - thank you. I agree that we should retain surface_albedo_assuming_deep_snow and surface_albedo_assuming_no_snow as separate quantities. However, I think we are agreed that we should have a single surface_albedo name and use area_types in the circumstances where the surface type truly is different and no additional conditions are being assumed.
<br />
<br />3. Evaporation
<br />
Karl made some important points about the definition of evaporation, evapotranspiration and sublimation. Clearly we need to remain consistent with previous usage of these terms - I have taken this into account in my comments on some of the individual names.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.1 albc Canopy Albedo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; canopy_albedo (1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Canopy&quot; means the plant or vegetation canopy. Albedo is the ratio of outgoing to incoming shortwave irradiance.
</em><br />
<br />I think we are all agreed that canopy_albedo should be a separate standard name and certainly it is different from a surface albedo. Using the updated definition of canopy we would now have:
<br />
'Albedo is the ratio of outgoing to incoming shortwave irradiance. &quot;Canopy&quot; means the vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation, and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy. Reference: AMS Glossary <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy">http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy</a>.'
<br />
<br />Okay?
<br />
<br />This name is still under discussion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.2 albsn Snow and Ice Albedo [1]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Albedo of snow and ice covered surface.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; snow_and_ice_albedo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Snow and ice albedo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- OR --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This could be handled with existing name surface_albedo and a new area type &quot;snow_or_ice&quot;. [Note that &quot;landice&quot; appears to exclude ice on lakes, which may be a significant component of this albedo]
</em><br />
<br />I think we are agreed now to use the existing surface_albedo name for this quantity. The definition would be amended to read as follows:
<br />
'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. Albedo is the ratio of outgoing to incoming shortwave irradiance. To specify the nature of the surface a cell_methods attribute should be supplied as described in Chapter 7.3.3 of the CF Conventions.'
<br />
<br />Okay?
<br />
<br />In addition we would introduce two new area_types as suggested by Martin:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ice_on_land
</em><br />
'The area type ice_on_land means Ice in glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets &amp; shelves, river and lake ice, and any other ice on a land surface, such as frozen flood water. This is distinct from the area type 'land ice' which has a narrower definition.'
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The combined term could be ice_and_snow_on_land
</em><br />
'The area type ice_and_snow_on_land means ice in glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets &amp; shelves, river and lake ice, any other ice on a land surface, such as frozen flood water, and snow lying on such ice or on the land surface.'
<br />
<br />Are these definitions okay?
<br />
<br />This name is still under discussion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Evaporation and transpiration fluxes [3] Variations on the theme of the existing water_evaporation_flux term.

<br />Naively, I would have thought that both rain and snow could be intercepted. Some of the rain will drip from the leaves onto the ground, while some will sit on the leaves as water droplets and eventually evaporate into the air. Certainly some snowfall would also be intercepted.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; c) It appears that &quot;evaporation&quot; here must surely include sublimation

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (as discussed in 1 above), which I think is good.
</em><br />
<br />Certainly the definition as given above does include sublimation.
<br />
<br />Karl makes the point that in CMIP5
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) &quot;water_evaporation_flux&quot; has included &quot;transpiration&quot; and included 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water_sublimation_flux from all parts of the surface (soil and vegetation)
</em><br />
and that it is important we do not alter or confuse this interpretation in the current set of proposals.
<br />
<br />I understand the proposed quantity to mean the evaporation (including sublimation) of any precipitation that falls and comes to rest on the canopy. I think it doesn't include transpiration, nor does it include evaporation from the ground. We do have existing names canopy_water_amount and change_over_time_in_canopy_water_amount. Following this pattern, perhaps we could call the proposed quantity: 
<br />
<br />tendency_of_canopy_water_amount_due_to_evaporation_of_intercepted_precipitation (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area. &quot;Water&quot; means water in all phases. &quot;Canopy&quot; means the vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation, and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy. Reference: AMS Glossary <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy">http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy</a>.' The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Intercepted precipitation&quot; is the precipitation, including snow, that is intercepted by the vegetation canopy and then evaporates without ever reaching the surface or entering the plant through its roots. Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone into<br />
&nbsp;vapor is called &quot;sublimation&quot;.) Evaporation of intercepted precipitation excludes plant transpiration and evaporation from the surface beneath the canopy.'
<br />
<br />This avoids calling it a 'water_evaporation_flux' while (I hope) still accurately representing the quantity. Is this an acceptable compromise?
<br />
<br />This name is still under discussion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.2 eow Open Water Evaporation [kg m-2 s-1]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A new term &quot;water_evaporation_flux_from_open_water&quot; would work here, but it might make more sense to define an area type for open water 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and use the existing standard name &quot;water_evaporation_flux&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />The definition of the existing water_evaporation_flux says:
<br />
'Water means water in all phases. Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone into vapor is called &quot;sublimation&quot;.) In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. Unless indicated in the cell_methods attribute, a quantity is assumed to apply to the whole area of each horizontal grid box. Previously, the qualifier where_type was used to specify that the quantity applies only to the part of the grid box of the named type. Names containing the where_type qualifier are deprecated and newly created data should use the cell_methods attribute to indicate the horizontal area to which the quantity applies.'
<br />
<br />Regarding &quot;open water&quot; Martin wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The phrase &quot;open water&quot; appears to have different meanings for oceans and freshwater. For freshwater it means areas that are free of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vegetation or other obstacles. I'm not sure it is really right for an area type: when used in the context of swimming, &quot;open water&quot; means water 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some distance from the shore or banks, but for evaporation it just means evaporation from the water/air interface as opposed to evaporation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water which is in contact with a solid boundary. We could, perhaps, use &quot;fresh_free_water_surface&quot; (Areas where there is a free interface 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between freshwater and the atmosphere without vegetation or other obstructions).
</em><br />
<br />I think perhaps we could just say &quot;fresh_free_water&quot; and the definition would be 'An area type of fresh_free_water means a free interface between freshwater and the atmosphere without vegetation or other obstructions'.
<br />
<br />The standard name definition doesn't mention anything about transpiration and, for the open water quantity, no vegetation is involved. To avoid confusion with the total evaporation/evapotranspiration quantity, I suggest we introduce a new standard name of surface_water_evaporation_flux. It would be defined exactly as above, except for one additional sentence saying that transpiration is NOT included in this name.
<br />
<br />This name is still under discussion.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; roots and exited through stomata in the leaves; it still ends up in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atmosphere as vapor.
</em><br />
<br />In view of this, Martin has suggested that we should make the existing water_evaporation_flux name into an alias of water_evapotranspiration_flux and adding to the definition. I agree this would be a very good step. So then we would have:
<br />
water_evapotranspiration_flux
<br />
'Water means water in all phases. &quot;Evapotranspiration&quot; means all water vapor fluxes from the surface: liquid evaporation, sublimation and transpiration.
<br />
Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone into vapor is called &quot;sublimation&quot;.) Transpiration is the process by which water is carried from the roots of plants and evaporates from the stomata. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. Unless indicated in the cell_methods attribute, a quantity is assumed to apply to the whole area of each horizontal grid box.'
<br />
<br />Keeping the reference to cell_methods in the definition is useful because it potentially allows the use of area type to describe evapotranspiration from different types of vegetation in a single grid box, even if there is no requirement to do that at the moment. I have also added a definition for 'transpiration' (which we haven't had before).
<br />
<br />Taking this approach of having separate surface evaporation and evapotranspiration fluxes in proposals 2.2 and 2.3 seems to me the tidiest and least confusing way of accommodating the CMIP6 quantities while not introducing inconsistencies with CMIP5. I note that this does raise an interesting wrinkle as regards aliases: currently water_evaporation_flux has an alias of water_evaporation_flux_where_sea_ice which clearly would not include vegetated areas and is therefore more akin to the surface_water_evaporation_flux name I am now suggesting for 2.2. I think it makes sense to list water_evaporation_flux_where_sea_ice as an alias of surface_water_evaporation_flux, rather than water_evapotranspiration_flux. We have never 'transferred' an alias in this way before, but I think it is the best approach to preserving the meaning of all the terms, past and present. Do others agree?

<br />This name was introduced some years ago (possibly for CMIP5, but I can't quite remember). I do recall it being discussed for quite a while on the list before being agreed. I'm not keen on having 'temperature_fluxes' either! It is defined as:
<br />
'The quantity with standard name temperature_flux_due_to_rainfall_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water is the heat energy carried by rainfall entering the sea at the sea surface. It is calculated relative to the heat that would be carried by rainfall entering the sea at zero degrees Celsius. It is calculated as the product QrainCpTrain, where Qrain is the mass flux of rainfall entering the sea (kg m-2 s-1), Cp is the specific heat capacity of water and Train is the temperature in degrees Celsius of the rain water entering the sea surface. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.'
<br />
So it is a heat flux, but a relative one.
<br />
<br />It has been suggested that we might call this one:
<br />
heat_flux_into_snow_and_ice_on_land_due_to_rainfall
<br />
Martin wrote:
<br />
I believe that the heat flux here depends on the temperature of the target medium (or, rather, the difference in temperature between the target and source)
<br />
So adapting the definition of the existing name would give us something like:
<br />
'The quantity with standard name heat_flux_into_snow_and_ice_due_to_rainfall is the heat energy carried by rain falling onto the snow and ice. It is calculated as the product QrainCpTdiff, where Qrain is the mass flux of rainfall reaching the snow and ice surface, Cp is the specific heat capacity of water and Tdiff is the difference in temperature of the rain water and the frozen surface. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.'
<br />
<br />However, I see that none of us is currently very clear about what this quantity really means and Martin is seeking further clarification. I will await the outcome of that before proceeding any further with this name.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is a variation of the CMIP5 variable &quot;sbl&quot; which used the existing term surface_snow_and_ice_sublimation_flux. Here, we just drop &quot;and_ice&quot; &gt; to get a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; term referring to the ice only.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking at existing names I see we also have surface_snow_sublimation_amount. Rather than talking about sublimation amount in one name and sublimation

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; name is to describe changes at the surface, rather than a water vapour flux into the atmosphere. Hence I suggest introducing aliases:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_snow_sublimation_amount -&gt; tendency_of_surface_snow_amount_due_to_sublimation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_snow_and_ice_sublimation_flux -&gt; tendency_of_surface_snow_and_ice_amount_due_to_sublimation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and calling the proposed quantity:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_ice_amount_due_to_sublimation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of these names specify that the snow and ice are located on land, so as with the albedo and evaporation names we probably need to use them in &gt; conjunction with an area type. Do you agree with this approach?

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, this is good.

<br />Okay, thank you, these changes are agreed. I will create the aliases and add the new name as follows:
<br />
tendency_of_surface_ice_amount_due_to_sublimation (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Sublimation is the conversion of solid into vapor. Unless indicated in the cell_methods attribute, a quantity is assumed to apply to the whole area of each horizontal grid box.'
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for publication in the standard name table and will be included in the June update.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 7.3 snmsl Water flowing out of snowpack [kg m-2 s-1]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is a variation of snm [surface_snow_melt_flux], but considering only the component of the flux into soil:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; surface_snow_melt_flux_into_soil

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For this name I suggest a different form:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, this looks good to me. Longer, but the additional clarity justifies this.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, thank you. This name is accepted for publication in the standard name table and will be added in the June update.
<br />
<br />(7.4 canopy_snow_amount has already been accepted.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7.5 sw Surface Water Storage (excluding snow) [kg m-2]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The existing term surface_water_amount refers to &quot;.. the amount on the ground, excluding that on the plant or vegetation canopy&quot;, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;water&quot; is assumed to refer to all phases. There is a term &quot;land_based_water_amount&quot; under discussion for PMIP which refers to &quot;This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity is often known as Terrestrial Water Storage. It includes surface water (water in rivers, wetlands, lakes, snow, vegetation and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reservoirs) and subsurface water (soil moisture, groundwater)&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming that this term is intended to be a variation on the first, surface_water_amount, and the amount includes only liquid phase water 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (excluding snow and ice):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_liquid_water_amount
</em><br />
<br />This name is currently listed as:
<br />
land_surface_liquid_water_amount (kg m-2)
<br />
'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area. The quantity with standard name land_surface_liquid_water_amount includes water in rivers, wetlands, lakes, snow, vegetation and reservoirs.'
<br />
<br />We are still awaiting clarification of the definition of land water and we will need to wait for the outcome of that before we can finalise this name.
<br />
<br />This name is still under discussion.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
