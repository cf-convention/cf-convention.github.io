Dear Andy, Roy and Jonathan,
<br />
<br />I have reviewed these proposals for new sea surface wave names. Thanks once again for a clear and useful discussion. Consensus was reached in May, so the following 16 new names are accepted for publication in the standard name table:
<br />
<br />sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_from_direction (degree)
<br />
'The quantity with standard name sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_from_direction is the direction from which the third most energetic swell waves are coming. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The tertiary swell wave is the third most energetic swell wave. The phrase &quot;from_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_from_direction and indicates the direction from which the velocity vector of X is coming. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north.'
<br />
<br />sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_mean_period (s)
<br />
'The quantity with standard name sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_mean_period is the mean period of the third most energetic swell waves. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The tertiary swell wave is the third most energetic swell wave. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Wave period is the interval of time between repeated features on the waveform such as crests, troughs or upward passes through the mean level. Wave mean period is the mean period measured over the observation duration.'
<br />
<br />sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_significant_height (m)
<br />
'Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The tertiary swell wave is the third most energetic swell wave. Significant wave height is a statistic computed from wave measurements and corresponds to the mean height of the highest one third of the waves, where the height is defined as the vertical distance from a wave trough to the following wave crest.'
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wind_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum (s)
<br />
'The quantity with standard name sea_surface_wind_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the period of the most energetic waves within the wind wave component of a sea. Wind waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the high frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Wave period is the interval of time between repeated features on the waveform such as crests, troughs or upward passes through the mean level. The phrase &quot;wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave period, describes the period of the most energetic waves within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.'
<br />
<br />sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum (s)
<br />
' The quantity with standard name sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the period of the most energetic waves within the primary swell wave component of a sea. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The primary swell wave is the most energetic swell wave. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Wave period is the interval of time between repeated features on the waveform such as crests, troughs or upward passes through the mean level. The phrase &quot;wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave period, describes the period of the most energetic waves within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.'
<br />
<br />sea_surface_secondary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum (s)
<br />
' The quantity with standard name sea_surface_secondary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the period of the most energetic waves within the secondary swell wave component of a sea. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The secondary swell wave is the second most energetic wave in the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Wave period is the interval of time between repeated features on the waveform such as crests, troughs or upward passes through the mean level. The phrase &quot;wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave period, describes the period of the most energetic waves within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.'
<br />
<br />sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum (s)
<br />
'The quantity with standard name sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the period of the most energetic waves within the tertiary swell wave component of a sea. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The tertiary swell wave is the third most energetic swell wave. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Wave period is the interval of time between repeated features on the waveform such as crests, troughs or upward passes through the mean level. The phrase &quot;wave_period_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave period, describes the period of the most energetic waves within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.'
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wind_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum (m2 s)
<br />
'The quantity with standard name sea_surface_wind_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the energy of the most energetic waves within the wind wave component of a sea. Wind waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the high frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The phrase &quot;wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum&quot;, sometimes called peak wave energy, describes the maximum value of the wave_variance_spectral_density within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.'
<br />
<br />sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum (m2 s)
<br />
'The quantity with standard name sea_surface_primary_swell_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the energy of the most energetic waves within the primary swell wave component of a sea.

<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_directional_spread (degree)
<br />
'Directional spread is the (one-sided) directional width within a given sub-domain of the wave directional spectrum, S(t,x,y,f,theta) where t is time, x and y are horizontal coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), f is frequency and theta is direction. For a given mean wave (beam) direction the quantity approximates half the root mean square width about the beam axis, as derived either directly from circular moments or via the Fourier components of the wave directional spectrum.'
