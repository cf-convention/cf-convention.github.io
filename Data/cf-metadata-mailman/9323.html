It?s a brilliant effort, if I may say. I?ve been following and appreciating it (wanted it for a long time!) and I think it is very close.
<br />
<br />If I may say so, it deserves a bit of time for everyone to catch up, before enshrinement.  I have two questions I?d like to ask, and one editing nit.
<br />
<br />Question 1: The last version I found is enclosed, but I can?t tell if it is the last version. (Please note the long tails of the emails make it extremely time-consuming to find the content when trying to catch up. Hence I have sent this without the long tail.)
<br />
<br />This version does not seem to address Nan?s suggestion to put the platform description after the roll/pitch/etc description, which I also like. Still, I can see advantages both ways.
<br />
<br />Question 2: The one concern I have, sorry if you dealt with it thoroughly, is about the expression in each definition that reads something like &quot;Roll is a rotation about an axis that is perpendicular to the local vertical axis and is coplanar with the nominal forward motion direction of the platform.?  I may be mis-remembering, but from my airplane navigation days my understanding is that the role is around the axis that points out the front of the airplane. If the airplane is pitched up, the roll is around the pitched-up vector; if the airplane is yawing to the right, the roll is around the actual direction, not the travel direction.  This is important at small scales when dealing with the spherical coordinate math necessary to point telescopes; it?s important at large scales if you imagine a fighter jet flying vertically up or down, and executing a roll (the roll axis is definitely not perpendicular to the local vertical axis in this case, unless you mean ?platform local?, which I believe is how it is defi<br />
ned and I?m pretty sure is how it is measured by the accelerometers).  I believe that satellites work the same way also?once they define ?front?, the measurements and calculations for roll are all around where front is, and similar patterns apply for pitch (measured relative to a line perpendicular to front-back axis directly through the wings) and yaw (measured around an axis vertical to the airplane local?note that the definitions for yaw include &quot;Yaw is a rotation about the axis of rotation?, and appear to have lost the description of what the axis of rotation *is*.
<br />
<br />I cite Wikipedia as my authority, not just because it matches my memory but also because it is footnoted, and refers to both airplanes and satellites using this reference frame.
<br />
<br />Finally, my editing nit is that these definitions have replaced smart apostrophes with question marks, I assume dumb apostrophes are the order of the day.
