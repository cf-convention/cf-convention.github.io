<br />
Good morning,
<br />
<br /><br />I am happy to go with the IUPAC names if needs be however, hfc is standard nomenclature and I would have thought the most likely term to be searched. I also note that there are already standard names for several HCFCs and CFCs, for which the standard names are 'mole_fraction_of_cfc11_in_air' etc. Nevertheless, see below a list of the requested standard/long names and definitions, using both HFC and IUPAC nomenclature. I am happy for you to choose which ones we use, please advise.

<br />
<br />Long name: mole_fraction_of_hfc134a_in_air
<br />
<br />Definition: Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  The IUPAC name for hfc134a is 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.
<br />
<br /><br />Standard name: mole_fraction_of_hfc143a_in_air
<br />

<br />
<br />HI again,
<br />
<br />I'd prefer it to be somewhere in the Standard Name entry because that is searchable either through the XML document on the CF site or through the vocabulary servers handling Standard Names. That way your data gets discovered by other communities who might search for '1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane'.  I've dealt with quite a few oceanographic halocarbon data sets over the years, but had never come across the 'hfc' nomenclature before.
<br />
<br />To my knowledge the long name doesn't get scraped by data discovery systems. It is used more as usage metadata to help users better understand the measurements. By all means include the IUPAC name in the long name, but I would also keep the hfc synonym there.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.
<br />
<br /><br />I have now retired but will continue to be active through an Emeritus Fellowship using this e-mail address.

<br /><br />Hi Roy,
<br />
<br /><br />Would it make more sense to leave the standard name as suggested, but replace 'hfc134a' with '1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane' in the long name, for simplicity? This is my first venture into the CEDa archives so please advise, I am happy to change the long names if needs be.
<br />
<br /><br />Cheers,
<br />
<br /><br />Dan

<br />
<br />Dear Dan,
<br />
<br />I think it would be better to have the IUPAC names somewhere (e.g. 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane for hfc134a if Wikipedia is correct) in the Standard Name entry. I'd be happy with it in the definition but would not object to it being in the Standard Name itself.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

Subject: [CF-metadata] Addition of HFC standard names
<br />
<br /><br />Dear All,
<br />
<br />I'd like to request an addition to the standard name list for atmospheric measurements of hydrofluorocarbons HFC-134a, HFC-143a, HFC-125, HFC-152a, HFC-32 and HFC-23. Here are the details of the proposed standard names.
<br />
<br />Proposal for a new standard variable names:
<br />
<br />Names:
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hfc134a_in_air
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hfc143a_in_air
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hfc125_in_air
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hfc152a_in_air
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hfc32_in_air
<br />
mole_fraction_of_hfc23_in_air
<br />
<br />Description: Atmospheric measurements of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) are reported as mole fraction data in units of parts per trillion (ppt, 1E-12). The long name will remain the same as the standard name.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance,
<br />
<br />Dan
