<br />
Dear all
<br />
<br />As you know, CF currently uses this email list for discussion of standard name
<br />
proposals and all other matters except for proposals to change the conventions.
<br />
<br />For the latter, we have been using trac for years, but have recently completed
<br />
migration of that function to GitHub. The source of the CF conventions document
<br />
is now in GitHub and version 1.7 was generated from it. In future, proposed
<br />
conventions changes will be discussed as GitHub issues on the conventions
<br />
repository, and the changes in wording will be finalised in pull requests. This
<br />
is convenient because it provides continuity from the discussion to the
<br />
modified document. We are due to prepare and release version 1.8, freeze trac
<br />
and publish guidelines for using GitHub in future for conventions changes.
<br />
<br />One of the reasons this has not yet been done is that it's important to keep
<br />
everyone informed of conventions changes. For a while, postings to the GitHub
<br />
conventions repository were sent to the subscribers to this email list, but as
<br />
you remember there were complaints about the amount of traffic, and some
<br />
confusions were caused by people replying to GitHub by email, so the email feed
<br />
was switched off while there was further discussion on the CF committee of how
<br />
to proceed.
<br />
<br />Now we would like to present a new proposal, as follows:
<br />
<br />* To change to using GitHub for standard name proposals and all other matters,
<br />
as issues in a different repository from the conventions (probably called
<br />
&quot;discuss&quot;). If we make this change, anyone who wishes to make a new standard
<br />
name proposal or start a discussion thread about something else will need a
<br />
GitHub username, and will log on to GitHub and post it there as a new GitHub
<br />
issue. This is not difficult (see below). It does not involve any of the
<br />
complexity of git for making updates to a repository as this will be a place
<br />
solely to hold discussions and keep an archive of them.
<br />
<br />* To make sure that all existing subscribers to this list are kept in touch,
<br />
postings to the GitHub issues in the discuss and conventions repositories will
<br />
be distributed via email, initially to all subscribers to this email list.
<br />
Their subject lines will begin with [cf-metadata/discuss] and
<br />
[cf-metadata/conventions]. However, it will no longer be possible to reply to
<br />
them on this email list. The archives will be kept and also copied to
<br />
GitHub. To comment on a standard name proposal or other discussion, there will
<br />
be two options:
<br />
<br />* Either you can log onto GitHub and add to the issue in the discuss
<br />
repository,
<br />
<br />* Or you can *unsubscribe* from the broadcast emails (instructions will be
<br />
given for that), and instead *watch* the GitHub discuss repository. That means
<br />
you will receive the updates to issues by email from GitHub, rather than via an
<br />
email list, and you can then reply to GitHub by email. Your reply is magically
<br />
posted on GitHub. That facility means that you can carry out a discussion of an
<br />
issue entirely by email, once it's started, not much differently from an email
<br />
list.
<br />
<br />We do not wish to lose members of the CF community who are subscribed to this
<br />
list and remain interested in CF. The main reason for my writing this now is
<br />
to ask whether there are subscribers who would &quot;leave&quot; us because it's off-
<br />
putting to use GitHub. Please say if that is what you think before 8th April.
<br />
<br />Among the advantages of making this change are that
<br />
<br />* It would allow you to be selective, in that you could chose to be notified
<br />
about conventions but not standard names, or vice-versa, on GitHub. Of course,
<br />
we recommending watching both of them!
<br />
<br />* We won't have to maintain a CF email list, which is an administrative
<br />
complexity, especially as we currently have two different lists (for trac and
<br />
email), which have to be kept consistent manually. Anyone can join GitHub for
<br />
themselves and watch the CF repositories.
<br />
<br />Best wishes and thanks for your interest in CF
<br />
<br />Jonathan

<br /><br />To get a username on GitHub, go to <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> and sign up. This is
<br />
free! Once you have a username, you can sign in.
<br />
<br />The issues on the CF conventions repository are at
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues">https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues</a>
<br />
This shows the list of changes to 1.7 which are being discussed. (NB the name
<br />
of this repository will probably change, to improve consistency, and this is
<br />
not the repository for the standard name discussions, which we have not yet
<br />
created.) If you wanted to start a new issue, which is like a new email thread
<br />
e.g. for a standard name proposal, you would click the &quot;New issue&quot; button, and
<br />
get from there to a web form where you type plain text, and then &quot;Submit&quot; it.
<br />
<br />To comment on an issue (like replying to an email thread) you click on the
<br />
issue, go the bottom of the page, write in the box, and press &quot;Comment&quot;.
<br />
<br />To receive emails containing comments on any of the issues contributed by
<br />
others, you can &quot;watch&quot; the repository, by clicking on the drop-down menu
<br />
labelled &quot;Watch&quot; at the top of the page, with an icon like an eye. When you
<br />
receive such an email, you can reply to it and your reply will be posted to the
<br />
issue. (It tells you at the bottom of the email that you can do this, and gives
<br />
you the URL of the comment that's been sent in the the email in case you want
<br />
to do it on GitHub.)
