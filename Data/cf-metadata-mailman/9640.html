Hi Dan,
<br />
<br />PFC-14 is already present as mole_fraction_of_carbon_tetrafluoride_in_air (<a href="http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P07/current/GYGQPPOA/">http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P07/current/GYGQPPOA/</a>).
<br />
<br />Otherwise look fine.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.
<br />
<br /><br />I have now retired but will continue to be active through an Emeritus Fellowship using this e-mail address.

Subject: [CF-metadata] More trace gas standard names
<br />
<br /><br />Hi All,
<br />
<br /><br />I'd like to propose the following standard names for trace halogenated compounds measured on our Medusa GCMS instrument:
<br />
<br /><br />PFC-14
<br />
<br />Standard name: mole_fraction_of_pfc14_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
<br />Long name: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for pfc14 is CF4. The IUPAC name for pfc14 is tetrafluoromethane.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />PFC-116
<br />
<br />Standard name: mole_fraction_of_pfc116_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
<br />Long name: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for pfc116 is C2F6. The IUPAC name for pfc116 is hexafluoroethane.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />PFC-318
<br />
<br />Standard name: mole_fraction_of_pfc318_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
<br />Long name: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for pfc318 is c-C4F8. The IUPAC name for pfc318 is octafluorocyclobutane.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />NF3
<br />
<br />Standard name: mole_fraction_of_nitrogen_trifluoride_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
<br />Long name: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for nitrogen trifluoride is NF3. Nitrogen trifluoride is the IUPAC name.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />HFC-227ea
<br />
