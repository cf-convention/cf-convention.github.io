Just to be crystal clear there should be one hyphen in the full IUPAC name 1,1,1-trichloroethane - it's the second hyphen between trichloro and ethane that's the issue.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />Hi Alison,
<br />
<br />You're right about hcc140a - I'd missed that because of the hyphen in the IUPAC name trichloro-ethane. In my view the hyphen doesn't belong there (try googling trichloro-ethane) if the IUPAC standard is strictly followed - should be trichloroethane. If others agree maybe we should clean out the hyphens from the definitions in a future update?
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

Subject: Re: [CF-metadata] New halocarbon standard name requests
<br />
<br />Dear Dan and Roy,
<br />
<br />Thank you Dan for proposing these six new names and to Roy for the careful checking.
<br />
<br />Roy is correct that mole_fraction_of_carbon_tetrachloride_in_air already exists in the standard name table. In fact we have eight existing carbon_tetrachloride quantities but only one of them (tendency_of_atmosphere_moles_of_carbon_tetrachloride) mentions the IUPAC name, tetrachloromethane, in its definition. Although we don't need a new name, I will update the existing ones to add the IUPAC information to the definitions.
<br />
<br />The proposed name mole_fraction_of_methyl_chloroform_in_air doesn't currently exist in the standard name table. However, we do have the name mole_fraction_of_hcc140a_in_air defined as :
<br />
' &quot;Mole fraction&quot; is used in the construction &quot;mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for hcc140a is CH3CCl3. The IUPAC name for hcc140a is 1,1,1-trichloro-ethane.'
<br />
This appears to be the same chemical species so I don't think we need a new name for this one.  We have ten existing hcc140a names and if it is also commonly referred to as methyl chloroform I suggest we add that to the definitions as follows:
<br />
' &quot;Mole fraction&quot; is used in the construction &quot;mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for hcc140a, also called methyl chloroform, is CH3CCl3. The IUPAC name for hcc140a is 1,1,1-trichloro-ethane.'
<br />
Do others agree?
<br />
<br />To summarize where we are with this set of proposals, the following are accepted for publication in the standard name table and will be included in this week's update:
<br />
'mole_fraction_of_dichloromethane_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for dichloromethane is CH2Cl2. The IUPAC name is dichloromethane.'
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_chloroform_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for chloroform is CHCl3. The IUPAC name for chloroform is trichloromethane.'
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_perchloroethene_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for perchloroethene is CCl2CCl2. The IUPAC name for perchloroethene is tetrachloroethene.'
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_pfc218_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for pfc218 is C3F8. The IUPAC name for pfc218 is octafluoropropane.'
<br />
<br />The definitions of all existing carbon_tetrachloride names will be updated to add the IUPAC name of tetrachloromethane.
<br />
<br />The following proposals for new names are rejected because they are duplicates of existing names:
<br />
mole_fraction_of_carbon_tetrachloride_in_air;
<br />
mole_fraction_of_methyl_chloroform_in_air (it is proposed to update the definitions of existing hcc140a names to list methyl chloroform as a commonly used name for the same species).
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
