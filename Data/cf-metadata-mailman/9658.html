Hi Alison,
<br />
<br /><br />Thanks for this - it would indeed be useful to have both PFC-14 and methyl chloroform listed in the definitions. Apologies for not spotting these names in the first place, hcc140a in particular I'd never heard of!
<br />
<br /><br />Cheers,
<br />
<br /><br />Dan

Subject: Re: [CF-metadata] More trace gas standard names
<br />
<br />Dear Dan and Roy,
<br />
<br />Thank you both for this set of proposals and the comments.
<br />
<br />Roy is correct that mole_fraction_of_pfc14_in_air is a synonym of the existing name mole_fraction_of_carbon_tetrafluoride_in_air. If pfc14 is a commonly used alternative we could list it in the definition in the same way as I'm suggesting for the hcc140a/methyl chloroform names in the other set of proposals. Would that be useful?
<br />
<br />Roy has also pointed out that the proposal for mole_fraction_of_pfc318_in_air is duplicated - thanks for spotting that!
<br />
<br />The following names are accepted for publication in the standard name table and will be added in this week's update:
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_pfc116_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for pfc116 is C2F6. The IUPAC name for pfc116 is hexafluoroethane.
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_pfc318_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for pfc318 is c-C4F8. The IUPAC name for pfc318 is octafluorocyclobutane.
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_nitrogen_trifluoride_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for nitrogen trifluoride is NF3. Nitrogen trifluoride is the IUPAC name.
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_hfc227ea_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for hfc227ea is C3HF7. The IUPAC name for hfc227ea is 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane.
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_hfc245fa_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for hfc245fa is C3H3F5. The IUPAC name for hfc245fa is 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane.
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_hfc4310mee_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for hfc4310mee is C5H2F10. The IUPAC name for hfc4310mee is 1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;mole_fraction_of_hfc365mfc_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for hfc365mfc is C4H5F5. The IUPAC name for hfc365mfc is 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane.
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_hfc236fa_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for hfc236fa is C3H2F6. The IUPAC name for hfc236fa is 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane.
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_hcfc124_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for hcfc124 is C2HClF4. The IUPAC name for hcfc124 is 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane.
<br />
<br />mole_fraction_of_sulfuryl_fluoride_in_air (Canonical unit: 1)
<br />
Definition: 'Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for sulfuryl fluoride is SO2F2. Sulfuryl fluoride is the IUPAC name.
<br />
<br />The following proposal is rejected because it is a synonym of the existing name mole_fraction_of_carbon_tetrafluoride_in_air:
<br />
mole_fraction_of_pfc14_in_air (it is proposed to update the definitions of existing carbon tetrafluoride names to list pfc14 as a commonly used name for the same species).
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
