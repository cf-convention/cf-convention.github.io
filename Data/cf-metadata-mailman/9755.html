Hi Martin,
<br />
<br />Thanks for taking a look and for your contributions ? I?ve also been lurking a bit in the background of #151 and hope that this is generally aligned with that. In general I agree that a pull request is definitely a superior format for tackling these kinds of questions, but because this might result in a bit of a ?big bang? change ? the changes I?m proposing are essentially intended to replace an older document, which furthermore only exists as in HTML and PDF ? I wanted to get the bones of it right in this form. I hope that our discussions online and at the upcoming meeting at ESIP can result in enough of a consensus to begin concrete work on it within the fruitful garden of GitHub; I?ll likely take advantage of the focus time in Tacoma to migrate the document at that time.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
Daniel

<br />
<br />Dear Daniel,
<br />
<br /><br />These look like generally good ideas.
<br />
<br /><br />Some of us have been discussing some related issues around moderation in a github issue on moderation of proposals (#151)&lt;<a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues/151">https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues/151</a>&gt;. 7 months after Chris Barker launched that discussion we have reached a level of agreement which we feel justifies moving to a pull request and update of the document ... but I notice that your interpretation of the process places a pull request at the start of the process.
<br />
<br /><br />There is some ambiguity in current governance, in that there doesn't appear to be anything in the rules to say how the rules will be updated. Perhaps that should be clarified as well. I can see that comments are accumulating in the margin of your google doc ... and I've contributed a couple myself, but I'm not sure that is going to be a good place for this community to discuss the complexities that some of your discussion items raise (the issue mentioned above has 43 contributions so far, and  covers a much narrower topic than your document).
<br />
<br /><br />For the time being, I don't think there is any conflict between what you are proposing and the conclusions of #151, though the subject matter is close in places -- so it may be OK to go ahead with the changes which have been agreed there ... but please take a look.
<br />
<br /><br />There may be a case for setting up an Ad-Hoc project team to resolve a number of related topics here.
<br />
<br /><br />regards,
<br />
<br />Martin

Subject: [CF-metadata] Proposal to streamline CF Governance process
<br />
<br /><br />Dear CF enthusiasts,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />In discussions last year and in advance of the upcoming CF meeting at ESIP, several colleagues have put forth the idea that the CF governance process could be enhanced. I have put together a few concrete ideas of what to do here in order to have a concrete item that we can point to, debate, disagree on, etc. I would like to propose these for discussion and for adoption ? in whole, in part, in changed form, or not at all ? at the upcoming meeting. You can find the document here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H9E1HKUzgmppLe091aVrHDeEbkPZXEML7_BUSc9Ddxs/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H9E1HKUzgmppLe091aVrHDeEbkPZXEML7_BUSc9Ddxs/edit?usp=sharing</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I am pleased that it has already gathered some input from some other members of the community, and I am particularly grateful for all errata, weak points and opportunities for improvement that have been highlighted. The goal of this proposal is not to be ?right?, but rather to discover a good solution that enhances the ability of the CF Conventions to adapt while optimally suiting their audience and active community. Please feel free to comment in the document if you see a way that it might be improved.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />As a novice active member of the CF community I?m cognizant of the fact that there?s a lot of experience embodied in the processes that we currently have, and that a lot of excellent work has been invested in order to bring the Conventions to the point they are today. I hope that being so new allows me to bring some fresh perspectives in, and that the result of our discussions will be a governance process that takes the best of the existing processes and improves upon them without throwing away the ?magic? that?s made the Conventions so useful and important across so many geophysical disciplines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I look forward to hearing your feedback.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Daniel
