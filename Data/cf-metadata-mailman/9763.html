Hi David,
<br />
<br />I only know what I have read in the GitHub help pages, but I understand them to mean that you have to create the repository yourself. I?m referring to the page I mentioned before ? the bit on ?User and Organization Pages sites?.  It says:
<br />
?To create an Organization Pages site, name the repository using the naming scheme &lt;orgname&gt;.github.io?
<br />
and then once it?s built
<br />
?An Organization Pages site is available at http(s)://&lt;orgname&gt;.github.io?.
<br />
<br />My impression is that if you create the repository with the correct name, ending in github.io, then GitHub automatically builds it (and rebuilds it following a merge or a push to the repo) and also automatically publishes it with the URL the same as the repository name. Currently cfconventions.org (owned by STFC) is set to redirect to http(s)://cf-convention.github.io, so if it does prove possible to rename the repository we?d also have to update where the domain name points to.
<br />
<br />The CF GitHub organisation was originally set up by Matthew Harris and Jeff Painter at PCMDI who transferred the website contents from the old web server. Perhaps they would be able to advise about the repository naming.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<br />Hi Alison,
<br />
<br />I'm not sure about this - I thought that the &quot;&lt;name&gt;.github.io&lt;<a href="http://github.io">http://github.io</a>&gt;&quot; site was somehow magically created for you by GitHub, not one that you named yourself? If this is right, I don't really know the implications of it, so I would welcome more expert opinions.
<br />
<br />That said, I realize that I have made a category mistake in that I thought that this proposal had been discussed on this CF-metadata forum, when it hadn't - it was talked about informally off-line and I confused the e-mails in my eagerness to get this sorted before the CF meeting next week. Many apologies. It's being discussed now, though!
<br />
<br />So, I haven't implemented the proposed changes, which is good because concerns have already been raised by Alison (see above), and also by Ethan, who points out that the proposed dropping of the &quot;cf-&quot; prefix from repository names would detrimentally remove any reference to CF in the names of forked repositories.
<br />
<br />I hope that I haven't  made too much confusion, and look forward to talking about it here.
<br />
<br />All the best,
<br />
David

Hi David,
<br />
<br />Sorry to be chiming in late on this but I just saw the emails from last week and my attention was drawn to this bit:
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io">https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io</a> will become: <a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/website">https://github.com/cf-convention/website</a>
<br />
<br />I?m absolutely not an expert on GitHub, but the help pages about publishing a website from a repository seem to indicate that it has to be called http(s)://&lt;orgname&gt;.github.io&lt;<a href="http://github.io">http://github.io</a>&gt; (see <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-orgation-and-project-pages">https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-orgation-and-project-pages</a>). You can then set up a custom domain name to point to that repository, which is what we do with the cfconventions.org&lt;<a href="http://cfconventions.org">http://cfconventions.org</a>&gt; name. This would seem to suggest that if you rename the repository as above, the website might stop working. Is this something you?ve already looked into?
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<br />Hello,
<br />
<br />Many apologies, but this week caught up with me, and I didn't get round to changing the repository names. But I will do it on Monday 8th July.
<br />
<br /><br />If you need to update a local repository, Guilherme pointed out that it might be a good idea to double check what you have before update the origin, with
<br />
<br />$ git remote -v
<br />
<br />For example, if you have  a  fork of  cf-conventions called 'origin', then the above command might return ...
<br />
<br />origin git at github.com:castelao/cf-conventions.git&lt;mailto:git at github.com:castelao/cf-conventions.git&gt; (fetch)
<br />
origin git at github.com:castelao/cf-conventions.git&lt;mailto:git at github.com:castelao/cf-conventions.git&gt; (push)
<br />
upstream git at github.com&lt;mailto:git at github.com&gt;:cf-convention/cf-conventions.git (fetch)
<br />
upstream git at github.com&lt;mailto:git at github.com&gt;:cf-convention/cf-conventions.git (push)
<br />
<br />... and you wouldn't update 'origin; rather you would update 'upstream' in this case:
<br />
<br />$ git remote set-url upstream <a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/conventions.git">https://github.com/cf-convention/conventions.git</a>
<br />
<br />(I hope that I have got this right, Guilherme!)
<br />
<br />All the best,
<br />
David

Hello,
<br />
<br />Somewhat later than I had intended, and following on from Jonathan's well-received suggestions on this list (starting from 2019-03-22), I shall be renaming the following CF GitHub repositories:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions">https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions</a> will become: <a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/conventions">https://github.com/cf-convention/conventions</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io">https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io</a> will become: <a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/website">https://github.com/cf-convention/website</a>
<br />
<br />I shall do this on Tuesday 2nd July (following the principle of never making changes that could affect other people just before the weekend).
<br />
<br />Aside from needing to rename our browser bookmarks, this should have no adverse effects on most people.
<br />
<br />However, if you have cloned either of these repositories, the old names should still work (according to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/renaming-a-repository">https://help.github.com/en/articles/renaming-a-repository</a>), but it is best to rename the remote URL as follows, e.g. for the &quot;conventions&quot; site:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  git remote set-url origin <a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/conventions.git">https://github.com/cf-convention/conventions.git</a>
</em><br />
<br />(Don't take my word for it! See <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-remotes-url">https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-remotes-url</a> for more details, for example.)
<br />
<br />Please let us know about any concerns that may still remain on this topic, all the best,
<br />
<br />David
