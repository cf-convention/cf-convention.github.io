Dear Daniel
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In discussions last year and in advance of the upcoming CF meeting at ESIP, several colleagues have put forth the idea that the CF governance process could be enhanced. I have put together a few concrete ideas of what to do here in order to have a concrete item that we can point to, debate, disagree on, etc. ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H9E1HKUzgmppLe091aVrHDeEbkPZXEML7_BUSc9Ddxs/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H9E1HKUzgmppLe091aVrHDeEbkPZXEML7_BUSc9Ddxs/edit?usp=sharing</a>
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for this initiative, for inviting comments on the documents and for our
<br />
exchange of emails (off-list).  Here I'm repeating a few things which I've
<br />
written in those emails, in preparation for the meeting next week. I hope to
<br />
participate remotely in some of that.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that there are two distinct aspects of how CF works that you're
<br />
addressing: (1) the process of reaching decisions, (2) the panel and
<br />
committees. While they are both important, I would say that these are distinct.
<br />
<br />(1) I am sure that everyone would like the decision-making process to be
<br />
efficient, and that we all know it sometimes is not, despite very thoughtful
<br />
and earnest debate. The migration of the conventions discussions (from trac)
<br />
and this email list (for standard name and other discussions) to GitHub may
<br />
streamline things a bit, but I feel the main reason why discussions are some-
<br />
times slow is the lack of impetus to reach a conclusion. More active moderation
<br />
may help, as discussed in github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues/151.
<br />
The current rules for making changes are at cfconventions.org/governance.html.
<br />
<br />(2) On the same page there is a link to the CF governance document of 2006.
<br />
Appendix 2 of that document describes how the committees work. Those are the
<br />
rules we've been following, and I think they are mostly fine. I don't think we
<br />
should discard this document and start again. Instead, I think we should
<br />
consider whether modifications are needed. We should of course put it in GitHub
<br />
too, as you have suggested, so I've converted it to asciidoc, which is at
<br />
www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/constitution.adoc
<br />
and rendered at
<br />
www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/constitution.html
<br />
In preparing this I have also made some changes to bring it up-to-date with
<br />
current situation and adopting some of your suggestions, including:
<br />
<br />* Remove what it says about the rules for making changes (your first issue),
<br />
since that belongs elsewhere.
<br />
<br />* Include your paragraph about the role of the community.
<br />
<br />* Add the annual meeting.
<br />
<br />* Replace the two committees, which are already identical in fact, with one
<br />
committee that has two secretaries.
<br />
<br />For comparison there's a link to the original version.
<br />
<br />The main body for making decisions about CF is the community, via the GitHub
<br />
discussions, not the committee. The committee doesn't do most of the work,
<br />
although it has responsibilities to make sure things are decided. The only
<br />
formal role the committee has is that there's a requirement for two of them to
<br />
support any change. In that role, the committee is supposed to maintain
<br />
consistency and continuity in overseeing the development of CF. I think that it
<br />
is right for the CF governance panel to appoint the committee, and it's
<br />
intended to represent the community, not to be exclusive. The aim is for it to
<br />
be a group of activists who have shown themselves to have a sustained,
<br />
constructive and broad interest in the conventions as a whole. I think it would
<br />
be useful for the meeting next week to talk about how the committee could
<br />
better facilitate the community process.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
