Dear Alison,
<br />
<br />1) The outcome of the ongoing discussion (Alison, Ian, Jonathan and us) 
<br />
are 2 possibilities for the standard name:
<br />
surface_direct_normal_shortwave_flux_in_air
<br />
or
<br />
surface_direct_along_beam_shortwave_flux_in_air
<br />
We prefer surface_direct_along_beam_shortwave_flux_in_air with following 
<br />
description:
<br />
'&quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;direct&quot; radiation 
<br />
is radiation that has followed a direct path from the sun. ?along_beam? 
<br />
refers to direct radiation on a plane perpendicular to the direction of 
<br />
the sun. This is in contrast to quantities like 
<br />
direct_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air, where the radiation falls on a 
<br />
horizontal plane at the earth surface. The term &quot;shortwave&quot; means 
<br />
shortwave radiation. In accordance with common usage in geophysical 
<br />
disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in 
<br />
physics.' Regarding solar energy applications, the given quantity is often 
<br />
called Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI).
<br />
<br />Our general opinion about the solar-related quantities is that the 
<br />
CF-conventions and the related standard names do not clearly separate 
<br />
between the following two aspects: 1) What is the orientation/tilt of the 
<br />
collector measuring the incoming beam and 2) from which direction in space 
<br />
the incoming radiation is received? For instance, the quantity 
<br />
surface_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air contains the word ?downwelling?, 
<br />
which refers a) to a collector oriented horizontal to the Earth surface 
<br />
and b) to the radiation received from the upper half space (all points in 
<br />
the sky). B) is in contradiction the your definition of ?downwelling? 
<br />
which you, Alison, argued to be a solely vertical oriented flux.
<br />
Sometimes ?downwelling? was abused e.g. for the quantity 
<br />
integral_wrt_time_of_surface_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air with 
<br />
?Downwelling radiation is radiation from above.?
<br />
<br />2) atmosphere_mass_content_of_rain is fine with us.
<br />
We definitely agree that all precipitation related quantities should get 
<br />
the prefix surface_ (e.g. rainfall_amount to surface_rainfall_amount and 
<br />
snowfall_amount to surface_snowfall_amount)
<br />

<br />
Ronny and Beate

Betreff:        RE: [CF-metadata] New standard names for norm. direct 
<br />
radiation and atm. mass [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Dear Beate and Ronny,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your proposals and apologies for the delay in responding. 
<br />
Thank you also to Jonathan and Ian for comments on these proposals. I have 
<br />
a number of comments and questions of my own and would welcome discussion 
<br />
of the issues raised.
<br />
<br />1. surface_normalized_direct_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air (W m-2)
<br />
'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. 
<br />
&quot;Normalized_direct&quot; radiation is radiation that has followed a direct path 
<br />
from the sun to a plane perpendicular to the direction of the sun (in 
<br />
contrast to the &quot;direct&quot; radiation, which falls on a plane horizontal at 
<br />
the earth surface). Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does 
<br />
not mean &quot;net downward&quot;. The sign convention is that &quot;upwelling&quot; is 
<br />
positive upwards and &quot;downwelling&quot; is positive downwards. The term 
<br />
&quot;shortwave&quot; means shortwave radiation. In accordance with common usage in 
<br />
geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux 
<br />
density&quot; in physics.'
<br />
<br />I agree with Jonathan that it is better not to include &quot;downwelling&quot; in 
<br />
the name because that suggests the flux is vertically downwards through 
<br />
the atmosphere which does not appear to be the case here. I agree also 
<br />
that &quot;normalized&quot; can have a number of meanings, although certainly we 
<br />
refer to &quot;normal&quot; in the sense of &quot;perpendicular to a surface&quot; in existing 
<br />
names and definitions.
<br />
<br />Ian's suggestion of 
<br />
surface_direct_normal_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air is close to the 
<br />
original proposal and uses similar terminology to the three existing 
<br />
direct radiation names (which all refer to 'shortwave' rather than 
<br />
'solar'). If we take out the 'downwelling' that leaves us with 
<br />
surface_direct_normal_shortwave_flux_in_air. Adding 'normal' to Jonathan's 
<br />
suggestion would give us surface_direct_normal_solar_irradiance_in_air. So 
<br />
I think it comes down to a choice between calling it a 'shortwave_flux' or 
<br />
a 'solar_irradiance'. The former is closer to existing direct names, the 
<br />
latter is apparently closer to WMO and energy industry terminology. I 
<br />
could live with either and am happy to go with whatever is the majority 
<br />
view on this point. I note that during a 2018 conversation about the 
<br />
definition of existing solar_irradiance and shortwave names Stephane Tarot 
<br />
(<a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2018/019809.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2018/019809.html</a> 
<br />
)pointed us to a WMO reference which states that 'solar' and 'shortwave' 
<br />
mean the same thing in meteorological terminology. 
<br />
<br />2. atmosphere_mass_content_of_rainwater (kg m-2)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; 
<br />
of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top 
<br />
of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
<br />
atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are 
<br />
used. &quot;Rainwater&quot; refers to the precipitating part of liquid water in the 
<br />
atmosphere - the cloud liquid water is excluded.'
<br />
<br />Existing names for rain/rainfall quantities don't use 'rainwater' as a 
<br />
term so I'd agree with Jonathan's suggestion of 
<br />
atmosphere_mass_content_of_rain. However, I think this proposal and the 
<br />
accompanying one for atmosphere_content_of_snow reveal a weakness in the 
<br />
definitions of some of our existing names.
<br />
<br />We have existing names such as rainfall_amount, convective_rainfall_amount 
<br />
and stratiform_rainfall_amount which all have the same units (kg m-2) as 
<br />
the proposed name. Are these intended to apply to rainfall that has 
<br />
already reached the earth's surface (and  should therefore be made into 
<br />
aliases by prepending them all with 'surface_')? The existing definitions 
<br />
just say ' &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area.' It's important to be clear 
<br />
about exactly _where_ the existing names apply, otherwise rainfall_amount 
<br />
could be interpreted to mean the same as the proposed 
<br />
atmosphere_mass_content_of_rain. I'd welcome comments about this.
<br />
<br />Also proposed is :
<br />
atmosphere_mass_content_of_snow (kg m-2)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; 
<br />
of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top 
<br />
of the atmosphere. &quot;Snow&quot; refers to the precipitating part of snow in the 
<br />
atmosphere - the cloud snow content is excluded. For the content between 
<br />
specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including 
<br />
content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.
<br />
<br />This proposal again made me wonder about existing names. We have 
<br />
surface_snow_amount, which clearly does refer to snow already lying on the 
<br />
surface, but also snowfall_amount. The definition of snowfall_amount 
<br />
simply says ' &quot;Amount&quot; means mass per unit area' which doesn't really 
<br />
help, but the fact that it says 'snowfall' makes me think that it means 
<br />
snow in the atmosphere, which would then be the same as the proposed new 
<br />
name. We need to clarify the existing names, decide whether we need the 
<br />
new names, and be as consistent as possible in our treatment of rain and 
<br />
snow quantities. Again, comments are most welcome!

</em><br />
<br />I agree that we should improve the definition. In fact there are 45 
<br />
existing cloud_liquid_water names, only one of which has a definition that 
<br />
actually explains what the term means!
<br />
<br />The definition of  mass_concentration_of_cloud_liquid_water_in_air says: 
<br />
'Cloud droplets are spherical and typically a few micrometers to a few 
<br />
tens of micrometers in diameter. An upper limit of 0.2 mm diameter is 
<br />
sometimes used to distinguish between cloud droplets and drizzle drops, 
<br />
but in active cumulus clouds strong updrafts can maintain much larger 
<br />
cloud droplets.' I suggest that we should add Beate and Ronny's sentence 
<br />
'&quot;Cloud liquid water&quot; refers to the liquid phase of cloud water' at the 
<br />
beginning of this explanation and then add it to all the existing names. 
<br />
For example, atmosphere_mass_content_of_cloud_liquid_water would then be 
<br />
defined as:
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; 
<br />
of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top 
<br />
of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
<br />
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. 
<br />
&quot;Cloud liquid water&quot; refers to the liquid phase of cloud water. Cloud 
<br />
droplets are spherical and typically a few micrometers to a few tens of 
<br />
micrometers in diameter. An upper limit of 0.2 mm diameter is sometimes 
<br />
used to distinguish between cloud droplets and drizzle drops, but in 
<br />
active cumulus clouds strong updrafts can maintain much larger cloud 
<br />
droplets.'
<br />
<br />Do others agree?
<br />
<br />4. Beate and Ronny wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The standard name air_potential_temperature is misleading because the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description refers to air and sea water.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We recommend replacing the standard name by potential_temperature.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with Jonathan that it is usual CF practice to have separate names 
<br />
when similar quantities are measured in different media. Thus we have both 
<br />
air_potential_temperature and sea_water_potential_temperature as standard 
<br />
n air_potential_temperature and ames. In both cases the definition of 
<br />
potential_temperature is the same, but the quantities labelled by the 
<br />
standard names are distinct.

<br />
<br />This is a comment on proposal 1  by Beate Geyer and Ronny Petrik on 20 
<br />
August for a new standard name 
<br />
surface_normalized_direct_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air. My response 
<br />
was delayed by trouble posting due to my changed email address.
<br />
<br />In the solar energy community, this quantity, as described by Beate and 
<br />
Ronny, is almost universally referred to as &quot;direct normal irradiance&quot;. 
<br />
Here &quot;normal&quot; means measured on a plane perpendicular (that is, normal) to 
<br />
the incoming solar beam. I note that the World Meteorological Organisation 
<br />
follows a different convention, naming the quantity measured on a normal 
<br />
plane &quot;direct irradiance&quot; and that measured on a horizontal plane &quot;direct 
<br />
horizontal irradiance&quot;, but that convention is not followed in the 
<br />
renewable energy sector. Thus I suggest that the proposed name should be 
<br />
changed to surface_direct_normal_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air to 
<br />
better align with solar energy practice. However, there might be CF 
<br />
rules/conventions/precedents I am unaware of that make the 
<br />
normalized_direct form preferable.

<br />Dear CF-metadata group,
<br />
we have several proposals, which we send as a numbered list. Thanks for 
<br />
your help beforehands!!
<br />
1.
<br />
Basing on surface_direct_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air we want to 
<br />
apply for the new standard name 
<br />
surface_normalized_direct_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air for use in 
<br />
renewable energy tasks. 
<br />
It is the surface_direct_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air on a plane, 
<br />
oriented perpendicular to the incoming beam.
<br />
New name: surface_normalized_direct_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air
<br />
Description: The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the 
<br />
atmosphere. ?Normalized_direct&quot; radiation is radiation that has followed a 
<br />
direct path from the sun to a plane perpendicular to the direction of the 
<br />
sun (in contrast to the ?direct? radiation, which falls on a plane 
<br />
horizontal at the earth surface). Downwelling radiation is radiation from 
<br />
above. It does not mean &quot;net downward&quot;. The sign convention is that 
<br />
&quot;upwelling&quot; is positive upwards and &quot;downwelling&quot; is positive downwards. 
<br />
The term &quot;shortwave&quot; means shortwave radiation. In accordance with common 
<br />
usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called 
<br />
&quot;flux density&quot; in physics.
