Dear Marcelo,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Thank you for your proposals and apologies for the delay in responding. As you may have seen in Alison's last email, I will be helping out with the maintenance of the standard names.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Thank you to Jonathan for comments on these proposals. They all look good and seem to match what already exists. The two phrases which were suggested as aliases, I believe to be new terms and have suggested a reason why so please comment if you agree/disagree. The following text will list each of the proposals, their units and descriptions (constructed from similar terms to be in line with standard name descriptions). Please let me know if there are any comments or further changes to be made. If no comments are made in the next 7 days, these are likely to be accepted in the next update.
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). The velocity at the sea floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). The velocity at the sea floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
<br />
<br />sea_water_to_direction_at_sea_floor
<br />
degree
<br />
The phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction and indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north. The direction at the sea floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
<br />
<br />sea_water_speed_at_sea_floor
<br />
ms-1
<br />
Speed is the magnitude of velocity. The speed at the sea floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made between different tidal components.
<br />
northward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made between different tidal components.

<br />
<br />The following should not be aliases of sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_x_velocity and sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_y_velocity, they should be proposed as new terms. The definition states '&quot;x&quot; indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x.', this has been done on purpose to allow this term to be used with any type of grid and not limiting it to a lat-lon grid. The term eastward is defined as '&quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward)' which limits this term to being 'zonal' (along a latitudinal circle).
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_eastward_velocity
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_northward_velocity
<br />
ms-1

<br /><br /><br />Dear Marcelo
<br />
<br /><br /><br />These look fine to me, thanks. Just to be clear - you're *not* proposing
<br />
<br />at_bottom, are you? I agree with you that at_sea_floor would be the right
<br />
<br />phrase to use.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Best wishes
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hello,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I would like to suggest the inclusion of standard names for u, v,
<br />
<br />speed and direction for bottom current and due to tides and Stokes
<br />
<br />drift:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />An example of model output with bottom velocity is the HYCOM NCODA forecast:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tds.hycom.org/thredds/catalog/GLBv0.08/expt_93.0/data/forecasts/runs/catalog.html?dataset=GLBv0.08/expt_93.0/data/forecasts/runs/FMRC_RUN_2019-10-13T12:00:00Z">https://tds.hycom.org/thredds/catalog/GLBv0.08/expt_93.0/data/forecasts/runs/catalog.html?dataset=GLBv0.08/expt_93.0/data/forecasts/runs/FMRC_RUN_2019-10-13T12:00:00Z</a>
<br />
<br />water_u_bottom (m/s) = Eastward Water Velocity =
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_at_bottom
<br />
<br />water_v_bottom (m/s) = Northward Water Velocity =
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_at_bottom
<br />
<br /><br /><br />based on existing variables:
<br />
<br />sea_water_potential_temperature_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_temperature_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_salinity_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_pressure_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br /><br /><br />my suggestion would be:
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_to_direction_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_speed_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br /><br /><br />An example of model output with currents due to tides and Stokes drift
<br />
<br />is the Mercator Forecast:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&amp;view=details&amp;product_id=GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024">http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&amp;view=details&amp;product_id=GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br />based on existing variables:
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_assuming_no_tide
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_assuming_no_tide
<br />
<br />ocean_vertical_momentum_diffusivity_due_to_tides
<br />
<br />ocean_vertical_tracer_diffusivity_due_to_tides
<br />
<br /><br /><br />my suggestion would be:
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
<br />
<br />sea_water_to_direction_due_to_tides
<br />
<br />sea_water_speed_due_to_tides
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Stokes drift is present in the current CF table with:
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_x_velocity
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_y_velocity
<br />
<br />I think it could help to add
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_eastward_velocity
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_northward_velocity
<br />
<br />as aliases to make it clear it is zonal and meridional currents, and
<br />
<br />not just along the grid X and Y dimensions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Thank you very much.
<br />
