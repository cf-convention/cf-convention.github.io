Dear Francesca,
<br />
<br />the accompanying explanations of what the variables represent are
<br />
perfect, I have nothing to contribute. I also agree with you that:
<br />
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_eastward_velocity
<br />
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_northward_velocity
<br />
should *not* be aliases for
<br />
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_x_velocity
<br />
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_y_velocity
<br />
<br />I am glad the new names will be considered for the next update. I have
<br />
some more suggestions for new standard names but I will be using the
<br />
GitHub issues discussion from now on as instructed
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues">https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues</a>
<br />
<br />Thank you very much for your work in maintaining the list.
<br />

Dear Marcelo,
Thank you for your proposals and apologies for the delay in
responding. As you may have seen in Alison's last email, I will be
helping out with the maintenance of the standard names.
Thank you to Jonathan for comments on these proposals. They all look
good and seem to match what already exists. The two phrases which were
suggested as aliases, I believe to be new terms and have suggested a
reason why so please comment if you agree/disagree. The following text
will list each of the proposals, their units and descriptions
(constructed from similar terms to be in line with standard name
descriptions). Please let me know if there are any comments or further
changes to be made. If no comments are made in the next 7 days, these
are likely to be accepted in the next update.
eastward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed eastward (negative
westward). The velocity at the sea floor is that adjacent to the ocean
bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
northward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed northward (negative
southward). The velocity at the sea floor is that adjacent to the
ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
sea_water_to_direction_at_sea_floor
degree
The phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction
and indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is
headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense,
measured positive clockwise from due north. The direction at the sea
floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest
grid cell in an ocean model.
sea_water_speed_at_sea_floor
ms-1
Speed is the magnitude of velocity. The speed at the sea floor is that
adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in
an ocean model.
eastward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed eastward (negative
westward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase
&quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a
sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by
omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical
gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made
between different tidal components.
northward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed northward (negative
southward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase
&quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a
sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by
omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical
gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made
between different tidal components.
sea_water_to_direction_due_to_tides
degree
The phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction
and indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is
headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense,
measured positive clockwise from due north. The specification of a
physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the
quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together
compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to
tides&quot; means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as
tides. No distinction is made between different tidal components.
sea_water_speed_due_to_tides
ms-1
Speed is the magnitude of velocity. The specification of a physical
process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named
is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general
quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all
astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction
is made between different tidal components.
The following should not be aliases of
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_x_velocity and
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_y_velocity, they should be proposed as
new terms. The definition states '&quot;x&quot; indicates a vector component
along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x.', this has been
done on purpose to allow this term to be used with any type of grid
and not limiting it to a lat-lon grid. The term eastward is defined as
'&quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when
directed eastward (negative westward)' which limits this term to being
'zonal' (along a latitudinal circle).
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_eastward_velocity
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed eastward (negative
westward). The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when
following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow.
For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves,
experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave
propagation.
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_northward_velocity
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed northward (negative
southward). The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when
following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow.
For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves,
experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave
propagation.
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_to_direction
degrees
The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a
specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance,
a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a
net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation. The
phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction and
indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is
headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense,
measured positive clockwise from due north.
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_speed
ms-1
The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a
specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance,
a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a
net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation. Speed
is the magnitude of velocity.
