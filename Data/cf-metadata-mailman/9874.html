I have a question about the definitions of the *_at_sea_floor standard names, which state &quot;? is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.&quot;
<br />
<br />I understand what this means for ocean models (but suspect it has quite different implications for models featuring cells of smaller thickness nearer the boundary).
<br />
<br />Does it mean anything for observational data? (In which case, there should be a corresponding definition, yes?) Or by definition, are all of these variables not applicable to observational data?
<br />
<br />This question is general and should not affect this particular request, so conceivably it should be a new topic if the answer is not straightforward.
<br />
<br />John

<br />Dear Jonathan, my suggestion of sea_water_from_direction_at_sea_floor
<br />
was based on the &quot;basic&quot; standard name:
<br />
sea_water_from_direction
<br />
The phrase &quot;from_direction&quot; is used in the construction
<br />
X_from_direction and indicates the direction from which the velocity
<br />
vector of X is coming. The direction is a bearing in the usual
<br />
geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north.
<br />
<br />so that the only difference would be to add the suffix _at_sea_floor
<br />
like it was done with:
<br />
sea_water_potential_temperature
<br />
sea_water_potential_temperature_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />Thank you.

<br />Dear Francesca and Marcelo
<br />
<br />I think that &quot;velocity&quot; ought to appear in this one:
<br />
sea_water_to_direction_at_sea_floor
<br />
It's the velocity which has a direction.
<br />

<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made between different tidal components.

<br />
<br />The following should not be aliases of sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_x_velocity and sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_y_velocity, they should be proposed as new terms. The definition states '&quot;x&quot; indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x.', this has been done on purpose to allow this term to be used with any type of grid and not limiting it to a lat-lon grid. The term eastward is defined as '&quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward)' which limits this term to being 'zonal' (along a latitudinal circle).
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_eastward_velocity

<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation.

<br /><br /><br />Dear Marcelo

<br /><br /><br />These look fine to me, thanks. Just to be clear - you're *not* proposing
<br />
<br />at_bottom, are you? I agree with you that at_sea_floor would be the right
<br />
<br />phrase to use.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hello,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I would like to suggest the inclusion of standard names for u, v,
<br />
<br />speed and direction for bottom current and due to tides and Stokes
<br />
<br />drift:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />An example of model output with bottom velocity is the HYCOM NCODA forecast:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tds.hycom.org/thredds/catalog/GLBv0.08/expt_93.0/data/forecasts/runs/catalog.html?dataset=GLBv0.08/expt_93.0/data/forecasts/runs/FMRC_RUN_2019-10-13T12:00:00Z">https://tds.hycom.org/thredds/catalog/GLBv0.08/expt_93.0/data/forecasts/runs/catalog.html?dataset=GLBv0.08/expt_93.0/data/forecasts/runs/FMRC_RUN_2019-10-13T12:00:00Z</a>
<br />
<br />water_u_bottom (m/s) = Eastward Water Velocity =
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_at_bottom
<br />
<br />water_v_bottom (m/s) = Northward Water Velocity =
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_at_bottom
<br />
<br /><br /><br />based on existing variables:
<br />
<br />sea_water_potential_temperature_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_temperature_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_salinity_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_pressure_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br /><br /><br />my suggestion would be:
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_to_direction_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br />sea_water_speed_at_sea_floor
<br />
<br /><br /><br />An example of model output with currents due to tides and Stokes drift
<br />
<br />is the Mercator Forecast:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&amp;view=details&amp;product_id=GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024">http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&amp;view=details&amp;product_id=GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br />based on existing variables:
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_assuming_no_tide
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_assuming_no_tide
<br />
<br />ocean_vertical_momentum_diffusivity_due_to_tides
<br />
<br />ocean_vertical_tracer_diffusivity_due_to_tides
<br />
<br /><br /><br />my suggestion would be:
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
<br />
<br />sea_water_to_direction_due_to_tides
<br />
<br />sea_water_speed_due_to_tides
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Stokes drift is present in the current CF table with:
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_x_velocity
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_y_velocity
<br />
<br />I think it could help to add
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_eastward_velocity
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_northward_velocity
<br />
<br />as aliases to make it clear it is zonal and meridional currents, and
<br />
<br />not just along the grid X and Y dimensions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Thank you very much.

Dear Francesca,
the accompanying explanations of what the variables represent are
perfect, I have nothing to contribute. I also agree with you that:
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_eastward_velocity
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_northward_velocity
should *not* be aliases for
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_x_velocity
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_y_velocity
I am glad the new names will be considered for the next update. I have
some more suggestions for new standard names but I will be using the
GitHub issues discussion from now on as instructed
<a href="https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues">https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues</a>
Thank you very much for your work in maintaining the list.

ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
sea_water_to_direction_at_sea_floor
degree
The phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction
and indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is
headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense,
measured positive clockwise from due north. The direction at the sea
floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest
grid cell in an ocean model.
sea_water_speed_at_sea_floor
ms-1
Speed is the magnitude of velocity. The speed at the sea floor is that
adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in
an ocean model.
eastward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed eastward (negative
westward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase
&quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a
sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by
omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical
gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made
between different tidal components.
northward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed northward (negative
southward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase
&quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a
sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by
omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical
gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made
between different tidal components.
sea_water_to_direction_due_to_tides

The phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction
and indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is
headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense,

sea_water_speed_due_to_tides
ms-1
Speed is the magnitude of velocity. The specification of a physical
process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named
is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general
quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all
astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction

The following should not be aliases of
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_x_velocity and
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_y_velocity, they should be proposed as
new terms. The definition states '&quot;x&quot; indicates a vector component
along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x.', this has been
done on purpose to allow this term to be used with any type of grid
and not limiting it to a lat-lon grid. The term eastward is defined as
'&quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when
directed eastward (negative westward)' which limits this term to being
'zonal' (along a latitudinal circle).
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_eastward_velocity
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed eastward (negative
westward). The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when
following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow.
For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves,
experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave
propagation.
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_northward_velocity
ms-1
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector
component which is positive when directed northward (negative
southward). The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when
following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow.
For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves,
experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave
propagation.
sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_to_direction

The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a
specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance,
a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a
net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation. The
phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction and
