Hi all,
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would like to apologise for the delay in getting these names finalised and responding, I have been helping at  a course in Leeds for the last week or so. The following standard names were set on the 11th of November and since this date no further discussion has happened. Both the author and others have agreed to the following names so these have been accepted and will be entered into the next version of the standard name table:
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). The velocity at the sea floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_at_sea_floor
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). The velocity at the sea floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
<br />
<br />sea_water_speed_at_sea_floor
<br />
ms-1
<br />
Speed is the magnitude of velocity. The speed at the sea floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
<br />
<br />eastward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made between different tidal components.
<br />
<br />northward_sea_water_velocity_due_to_tides
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made between different tidal components.
<br />
<br />sea_water_to_direction_due_to_tides
<br />
degree
<br />
The phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction and indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made between different tidal components.
<br />
<br />sea_water_speed_due_to_tides
<br />
ms-1
<br />
Speed is the magnitude of velocity. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Due to tides&quot; means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides. No distinction is made between different tidal components.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_eastward_velocity
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation.
<br />
<br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_northward_velocity
<br />
ms-1
<br />
A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation.
<br />
<br /><br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_to_direction
<br />
degrees
<br />
The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation. The phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction and indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north.
<br />
<br /><br />sea_surface_wave_stokes_drift_speed
<br />
<br />ms-1
<br />
<br />The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation. Speed is the magnitude of velocity.
<br />
<br />However, one of the terms set has sparked further discussion as to the addition of 'velocity' in the name.
<br />
<br />sea_water_to_direction_at_sea_floor
<br />
degree
<br />
The phrase &quot;to_direction&quot; is used in the construction X_to_direction and indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north. The direction at the sea floor is that adjacent to the ocean bottom, which would be the deepest grid cell in an ocean model.
<br />
<br />This change is simple and no objections have been raised so this will now be amended to the name:
<br />
<br />sea_water_velocity_to_direction_at_sea_floor
<br />
This would also include creating a change of 'sea_water_to_direction' and 'sea_water_from_direction' so this will also be added and be displayed as:
<br />
'sea_water_velocity_to_direction' and 'sea_water_velocity_from_direction'
<br />
<br />These names have now been accepted and will be added to the next release of the standard name table on the 10th of December.
<br />
<br />In response to the further discussions from John and Roy about the observation question and benthic boundary layer that is under the same subject heading, I will be starting a github issue with a new subject header to respond to this as it is starting a new discussion.
<br />
<br />Thank you,
<br />
