= Cell methods construct = 

The cell methods construct describes how the data values represent variation of the quantity within cells. It corresponds to the cell_methods attribute of the data variable in CF-netCDF files. It is an ordered list, because the methods specified are not necessarily commutative. Each entry of the list specifies either one or more dimensions, or a CF standard name (to describe variation with respect to a quantity which is not recorded as a dimension of the field), and a method e.g. mean (CF Appendix E). Special methods indicate climatological time processing.
