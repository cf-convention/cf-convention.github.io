= Cell Types For Unstructured Grid CF standard =

Similar to the data types that already exist [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf/CDL-Data-Types.html#CDL-Data-Types NetCDF Users Guide], we could add cell types to the netCDF library which describe the geometry of a cell. This would provide the information about how many vertices a cell has and there for how many node index values to expect in the connectivity. Each cell type would have a standard node ordering which describes how to format and use the connectivity data.

{{{
0 NC_PTS	A series of scattered points: earthquake locations
1 NC_TRK	A series of connected points: Drifter data
2 NC_LIN	An arbitrary list of lines each described by two end points: edge data

3 NC_TRI	Triangles described by the location of three vertices's
4 NC_QAD	Quadrilaterals described by the location of four vertices's
5 NC_PNT	etc
6 NC_HEX	etc
7 NC_SPT	etc
8 NC_OCT	etc
9 NC_MXD        Mixed 2D polygon cells

43   NC_TETRAHEDRON     ! Numbers are based on: #of faces #of sides     
64   NC_HEXAHEDRON
1443 NC_PYRAMID		! for more complex types: #of faces #of sides #of faces #of sides
3423 NC_WEDGE
9999 NC_UNSTRUCT	! MIXED 3D solids cells

''Better formatting?''

'''we need good pictures to do this properly!'''

== questions ==
 * Not sure about these 3D types: 
  * other suggestions for numbering, naming, geometries?
 * Do extruded cells need an NC_XXXXX integer typing?
 * For each of these we need to define a node numbering scheme,
      a face numbering scheme, and an edge numbering scheme
