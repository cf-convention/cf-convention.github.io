== Where should the Mesh !MetaData Reside? ==
The connectivity variable of each mesh could contain the mesh meta data for each mesh in the file. If a file has three meshs (for instance: Bathymetry, Sea Surface Height, and Data) then there would probably need to be three connectivity variables anyway to describe them. The one-to-one nature makes this variable an obvious choice. The names of all the meshes in a file should be specified in GlobalAttributes. These names should corrispond to the name of the connectivity variables.


== What should be included in the Mesh !MetaData? ==
 * Spatial Dimension and Topology
 * names of coordinate variables
 * name of coordinate type
 * Cell type (types)

=== Spatial Dimension and Topology ===

''' Spatial Dimension ''' ::
  ''The spatial dimension attribute corresponds to how many dimensions are needed to specify the coordinates for the points that make up your mesh. If your mesh exists in a 2D plane then choose 2, otherwise choose 3.'' '''Quote:''' [http://www.llnl.gov/visit/manuals.html LLNL's VisIt]

''' Topological Dimension ''' ::
  ''The Topological dimension attribute describes the number of logical dimensions used by your mesh, regardless of the dimension of the space that it sits in. For example you may have a planar suface of triangles sitting in 3D space. Such a mesh would be topologiacally 2D even though it sits in 3D space. The rule of thump that Visit follows is that if your mesh's cells are points then you have a mesh that is topologically 0D, lines are 1D, surfaces are 2D volumes are 3D.''

=== Name of Coordinate Variables ===
The name of the coordinate variables used define to location of points in a mesh should be specified in the mesh meta data. This will prevent confusion in the case that there is more than one set of coordinate locations in a file to support more than one mesh.

=== Name of Coordinate Type ===
There are a number of different coordinate types in use. Which type the mesh uses should be specified in the meta data. Some examples include: 
 * z-coordinates vs sigma-coordinates 
 * lat/lon vs projection
The types should be enumerated and standardized as part of the Unstructured Grid convention?

=== Cell Type ===
see CellType

== Example CDL for the connectivity variable ==
