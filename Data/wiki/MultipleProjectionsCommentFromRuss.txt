Although this is the shortest proposed representation, it encodes information in ''new'' syntax in the {{{grid_mapping}}} attribute value that clients would have to parse.  This specific syntax depends on a special use of the ":" character to indicate the preceding variable name is associated with a subsequent {{{grid_mapping}}} name.  This would not work if a {{{grid_mapping}}} name included a ":" character, e.g. "EPSG19914:" instead of "EPSG19914".  That may be far-fetched, but is the kind of detail adopting such specialized syntax would entail.

The other proposals use a list of blank-separated variable names in the value of attributes, but CF already assumes such syntax for the {{{coordinates}}} attribute, among others.

So I think the conciseness of this proposal comes at too high a cost, the acceptance of a new specialized syntax for grouping items in a list.
