I prefer this proposal, because it represents each coordinate system explicitly as something that can be referred to by name.  That makes it possible for a coordinate system to be represented even if there is no variable that uses it (yet).  Disadvantages include the length of the representation and the arbitrariness of the type chosen to represent the coordinate system variables {{{Dutch_CoordSystem}}} and {{{German_CoordSystem}}}.  These variables only exist to hang attributes on, so both their type and value are irrelevant. Nevertheless, this representation seems to capture the intent cleanly, and the extra name required for the coordinate system provides an additional opportunity for making the coordinate systems clear.
