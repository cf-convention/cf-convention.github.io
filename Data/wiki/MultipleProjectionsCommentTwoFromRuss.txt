A disadvantage of this proposed representation is redundancy.  Having to specify "EPSG19914" and "EPSG16362" twice for each projection seems inelegant and could lead to errors or difficulty seeing that the same grid_mapping was intended if the string specifying the projection was long and involved, for example using WKT syntax.
