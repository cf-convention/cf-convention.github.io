= Namespace Tagging of Attribute Names =

This is a proposed change to the CF specification for ticket #27.

== Requirement ==

Allow tagging of attribute names with namespace tags (similar to XML Namespace). Tagged attribute names are placed in the namespace associated with the tag.

== Summary of Change ==

 * Describe basic namespace concept to CF (URI and prefix/tag).
 * Describe how an attribute name is tagged with a namespace.
 * Add mechanism for declaring/encoding the namespaces used in a dataset.
 * Provide recommendations for maintaining backward compatibility.

== Benefit ==

This change will allow data providers to use multiple attribute conventions without having to worry about attribute name clashes. It will also allow CF to use other attribute conventions without duplicating them directly in CF.

== Status Quo ==
