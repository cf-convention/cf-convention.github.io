A cell measure construct must contain

  * A measure property, which indicates which metric of the space it supplies e.g. cell areas.
  * A units property consistent with the measure property e.g. `m2`.
  * A numeric array of metric values whose shape is determined by the domain axes in the order listed, optionally omitting any domain axes of size one. The array must all be of the same data type. It is assumed that the metric does not depend on any of the domain axes of the field which are not specified, along which the values are implicitly propagated.

and may contain

  * Other properties to describe itself.

In CF-netCDF files, cell measures constructs correspond to variables named by the `cell_measures` attribute of the data variable. As for dimensions, cell measures constructs of different field constructs are independent in the data model.
