The cell methods construct describes the methods by which the data values of the field construct represent variation within their cells. It is an ordered list, because the methods specified are not necessarily commutative. Each entry of the list specifies either one or more dimensions, or a CF standard name (to describe variation with respect to a quantity which is not recorded as a dimension of the field), and a method e.g. mean (CF Appendix E). Special methods indicate climatological time processing. The cell measures construct corresponds to the `cell_methods` attribute of the data variable in CF-netCDF files.
