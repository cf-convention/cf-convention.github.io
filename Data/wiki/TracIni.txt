= The Trac Configuration File =
[[TracGuideToc]]

Trac configuration is done by editing the '''`trac.ini`''' config file, located in `<projectenv>/conf/trac.ini`.

== Global Configuration ==

Since version 0.9, Trac can also read the configuration from a global `trac.ini` file. These global options will then be merged with the environment-specific options, where local options override global options.

The global configuration is by default localted in `$prefix/share/trac/conf/trac.ini`. It can be moved to a different location (for example, `/etc/trac.ini`), but that requires changing the file `trac/siteconfig.py` which gets created when Trac is installed. 

== Reference ==

This section is used to enable or disable components provided by plugins, as well as by Trac itself. The component to enable/disable is specified via the name of the option. Whether its enabled is determined by the option value; setting the value to `enabled` or `on` will enable the component, any other value (typically `disabled` or `off`) will disable the component.

The option name is either the fully qualified name of the components or the module/package prefix of the component. The former enables/disables a specific component, while the latter enables/disables any component in the specified package/module.

Consider the following configuration snippet:
{{{
[components]
trac.ticket.report.ReportModule = disabled
webadmin.* = enabled
}}}

The first option tells Trac to disable the [wiki:TracReports report module]. The second option instructs Trac to enable all components in the `webadmin` package. Note that the trailing wildcard is required for module/package matching.

See the ''Plugins'' page on ''About Trac'' to get the list of active components (requires `CONFIG_VIEW` [wiki:TracPermissions permissions].)

  ''Note that prior to Trac r2335 (that applies to 0.9b1 and 0.9b2), you would use a `[disabled_components]` section instead. See a [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracIni?version=42 previous version] of this page for the details.''
