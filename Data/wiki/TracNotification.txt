= Email Notification of Ticket Changes =
[[TracGuideToc]]

Trac supports basic notification for ticket changes using email. 

Email notification is useful to keep users up-to-date on tickets/issues of interest, and also provides a convenient way to post ticket changes to a dedicated mailing list. '''Note:''' As an example, this is how the [http://lists.edgewall.com/archive/trac-tickets/ Trac-tickets] mailing list works.

Disabled by default, notification can be activated and configured in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini].

== Receiving Notification ==
When reporting a new ticket or adding a comment, enter a valid email address in the ''reporter'', ''editor'' or ''cc'' field. Trac will automatically send you an email when changes are made to the ticket.

This is useful to keep up-to-date on an issue or enhancement request that interests you.

== Configuring SMTP Notification ==

=== Configuration Options ===
These are the available options for the ''[notification]'' section in trac.ini.
 * '''smtp_enabled''': Enable email notification.
 * '''smtp_server''': SMTP server used for notification messages.
 * '''smtp_user''': (''requires [milestone:0.9 0.9]'') user name for authentication SMTP account.
 * '''smtp_password''': (''requires [milestone:0.9 0.9]'') password for authentication SMTP account.
 * '''smtp_from''': Email address to use for ''Sender''-headers in notification emails.
 * '''smtp_replyto''': Email address to use for ''Reply-To''-headers in notification emails.
 * '''smtp_always_cc''': List of email addresses to always send notifications to. ''Typically used to post ticket changes to a dedicated mailing list.''
 * '''always_notify_reporter''':  Always send notifications to any address in the reporter field.
 * '''always_notify_owner''': (''requires [milestone:0.9 0.9]'') Always send notifications to the address in the owner field.

Either '''smtp_from''' or '''smtp_replyto''' (or both) ''must'' be set, otherwise Trac refuses to send notification mails.

=== Example Configuration ===

{{{

smtp_enabled = true
smtp_server = mail.example.com
smtp_from = notifier@example.com
smtp_replyto = myproj@projects.example.com
smtp_always_cc = ticketmaster@example.com, theboss+myproj@example.com
