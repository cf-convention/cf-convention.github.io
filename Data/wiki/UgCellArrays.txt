== Strawman Example of CDL for Cell Array Method ==

This is an example of a CDL based a simple hierarchy of geometric objects:
 grid::  A collection of cells
 cell::  An object with corners, edges and faces.  May or may not be three dimensional.
 edges:: Simple line segments, defined by two locations
 faces:: An area defined on a cell
 nodes:: The 1d geometry point.  A location.

A simple cell is defined by the indices which call out which nodes, edges, faces comprise the cell.  In this strawman CDL case the simple cell for the grid will be a triangle defined by three nodes and having some variables specified at edges and the central face  of the triangle.  Below in the grid meta data I call this "tri_face_edged" .

The data set will consist of a grid of cells.  The index array for the grid will dimensioned to the number of cells.  The data set will also consist of a collection of nodes, defined by their spatial location.  The data set will also contain a collection of edges.  Edges are defined by two nodes.  Edges must have a direction associated with them, so it is necessary to define an edge independent of the two different cells which it may be part of.
