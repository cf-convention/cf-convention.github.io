= Wiki Page Names =

Wiki page names are written using CamelCase. Within a wiki text, any word in CamelCase automatically becomes a hyperlink to the wiki page with that same name.

Page names must follow these rules:

 1. The name must consist of '''alphabetic characters only'''. No digits, spaces, punctuation, or underscores are allowed.
 1. A name must have at least two capital letters.
 1. The first character must be capitalized.
 1. Every capital letter must be followed by one or more lower-case letters. 
 1. The use of slash ( / ) is permitted to create a hierarchy inside the wiki.  (See !SubWiki and !ParentWiki macros in the [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/MacroBazaar MacroBazaar] which provide a way to list all sub-entries and a link up the hierarchy respectively.)

If you want to create a wiki page that doesn't follow CamelCase rules you could use the following syntax:
{{{
[wiki:Wiki_page]
}}}

This will be rendered as:
 [wiki:Wiki_page]
