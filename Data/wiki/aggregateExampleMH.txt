= Aggregation Over Discrete Coordinates =

Consider a CF NetCDF data set with 4 auxiliary coordinates describing an ensemble dimension:

{{{
netcdf input {
dimensions:
        longitude = 144 ;
        latitude = 73 ;
        time = UNLIMITED ; // (120 currently)
        time_bnd = 2 ;
        ensemble = 21 ;
        string4 = 4 ;
        string15 = 15 ;
        string60 = 60 ;
variables:
...
        int realization(ensemble) ;
                realization:long_name = "Number of the simulation in the ensemble" ;
        char experiment_id(ensemble, string4) ;
                experiment_id:long_name = "Experiment identifier" ;
        char source(ensemble, string60) ;
                source:long_name = "Method of production of the data" ;
        char institution(ensemble, string15) ;
                institution:long_name = "Institution responsible for the forecast system" ;
...
        float sh(time, ensemble, latitude, longitude) ;
                sh:units = "1" ;
                sh:standard_name = "specific_humidity" ;
                sh:cell_methods = "leadtime: mean (interval 6 h)" ;
                sh:coordinates = "experiment_id source realization institution" ;
}}}

I can calculate a range of statistics (e.g. mean) by aggregating over the dimension labelled ensemble.  Having calculated these statistics, how do I describe my result?

I do not think that I would like to process the auxiliary coordinates to try and deliver a coordinate of length one for any of the coordinates which have been collapsed over, these do not make sense in my mind.

I can maintain the four auxiliary coordinates from my input dataset, encoding these as ancillary variables, this seems like a helpful step.

However, how do I describe the aggregation in my result?

What can I put in the cell_methods string to define the result data set from this aggregation operation?

The cell_methods string should include the string "leadtime: mean (interval 6 h)" at the start, to maintain consistency; what should be added to this?  

cell_methods = "leadtime: mean (interval 6 h) ???????????????????" ;

Can the ancillary variables be referenced by the cell_methods?
