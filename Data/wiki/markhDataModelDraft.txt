Coordinate reference systems provide the information to geolocate coordinates and thus fields in three dimensional space.  A coordinate reference system provides a geographic frame of reference which coordinate instances may be defined with respect to.

Geo-location in the third dimension of space, the vertical, is only provided with respect to the datum of the coordinate reference system.

A coordinate instance may reference one coordinate reference system, this is the system the coordinate is defined with respect to.
