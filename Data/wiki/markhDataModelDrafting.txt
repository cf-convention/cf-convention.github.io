=== !CellMeasure === 

A !CellMeasure describes a measurement or parameter for cells within a domain; one is commonly used where the defined measure is not inferable from coordinates.

A !CellMeasure instance must define:

 * A measure property, which indicates the metric of the domain it supplies:
  * allowable values: 
   * ''area'',
   * ''volume''.
 * A units property consistent with the measure property:
  * allowable values (where ''L'' indicates a length unit): 
   * ''area'': ''L2'',
   * ''volume'': ''L3''.
 * A typed numeric array of metric ''values'':
  * the ''values'' array shape is consistent with the domain axes mediating the references from the containing Field.

A !CellMeasure may define further properties (see <reference to properties>):
 * using controlled vocabularies if the property name is controlled (such as standard_name).
