# GDT conventions

The GDT conventions were developed between 1997 and 1999 by Jonathan Gregory, Bob Drach, Simon Tett and Karl Taylor.
The last published version was 1.3.
Version 1.4 was not published because the authors had decided with Brian Eaton and Steve Hankin to begin development of CF instead.
