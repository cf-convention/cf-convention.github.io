Port of cfdm (and cf-agg) to C
* CFA Aggregation conventions (rules and serialisation).
  The rules were developed by Jonathan and David, the serialisation description is here: https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cfa-conventions (probably easier to go straight to https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cfa-conventions/blob/master/source/cfa.md)
  There is code that creates and uses those NetCDF files.
