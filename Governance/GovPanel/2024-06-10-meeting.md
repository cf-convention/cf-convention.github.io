### How to build community engagement? Evangelizing for CF?

### Concern about long, not-quite-contentious debate (external variables)
* Make more use of off-GH, video discussion
* Often more eloquent opinion wins
* Take off-line when needed - need to be summarized back to group for transparency
* Request for offline discussion - need to make open invitation and then summarize discussion and decisions.
