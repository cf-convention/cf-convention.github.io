### Update on 2024 CF Workshop planning (It is just over a week away, 17-20 Sept.)

### Does CF need a location/mechanism for publishing CF profiles, e.g., Swath (Issue #269)
* Swath, ACDD, CFA 
  * Not a profile if can’t read as CF without extra information
    * CFA looks like CF but doesn’t contain data, software would fail
* Some mechanism that supports profiles from the CF community
* More support than WMO profile, less than UGRID
* Space on web site to publish, PR, etc. - minimal CF governance, some review
* Decision: ???

### Localization (#528) defines attribute name suffixes (Requires parsing of attribute names)
* This is probably a discussion for the conventions committee rather than for the gov panel. Has it already been discussed there?
* Will be discussed at workshop

### CF Logo
* CF Discussion asking for logo ideas
* Opportunity to engage the community

### Engage with communities by answer questions on non-CF forums
* Point to training materials, more training materials
* If see questions, refer to them on CF issue, ask for volunteers to answer
* Responsive to standard names requests.
  * CMIP7 proposals happening now
