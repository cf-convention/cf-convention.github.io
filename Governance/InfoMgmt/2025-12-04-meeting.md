## Agenda/Notes
* Schedule next meeting
    * 5 March 2026 at 16:00 UTC
* Should CF Website enforce HTTPS (Issue \#[615](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io/issues/615))?
    * AGREE we should enable\!
    * DONE \- we enforced on web site repo, tested, and closed issue \#615.
    * Also done on cf-conventions, vocabularies, and mailing-list-archive repos
* What to do (in the next year or so) about the definite removal of XSLT from browsers (an issue raised by Barna)
    * Two options were discussed:
        * adding an xslt rendering script to the top of each xml
        * Making a javascript “single page app” that renders the standard name table from the xml like how the KWIK indexer works.
    * The option of the single page app was decided as good to explore due to the potential for a more data source agnostic view of the standard name table, e.g. we could switch to using NVS as the data source at some point in the future and still have the same views.
    * As per the [Google Chrome announcement](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt), xslt will be removed from stable chrome on November 17, 2026, but as early as March 10, 2026 for development release users.
* Update on vocab restructure (PR #[286](https://github.com/cf-convention/vocabularies/pull/286))
    * Going ahead with this and will have existing and new webpage running for an overlap period, then once happy website repo will no longer need to maintain vocab files.
* Review branch rules on GitHub repositories (do we want to add min review on PRs?) \+ to highlight no protection on vocab repo (only just realised this, I think because it’s newly added, happy to add protection if agreed \- FE)
    * Fran to add branch protection on Vocabs repo \- just reviewed and realise this is a non issue that GitHub is flagging up, as only admin can delete anyway.
    * Agreed no need for minimum review on PRs as roles cover merge ability
