# 2016 EarthCube netCDF-CF Workshop

**Advancing netCDF-CF for the Geosciences**

**24-26 May 2016, Boulder, Colorado**

***[Original website hosted at Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/events/2016CFWorkshop/ "Unidata's website")***

This workshop will focus on discussing current and future efforts and directions for the Climate and Forecast (CF)
metadata conventsions for netCDF (netCDF-CF). The meeting will be organized by the “Advancing netCDF-CF for Geoscience”
project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation's EarthCube program.
The project goals include several specific CF development efforts, including standards development and software prototyping.
(The project team is just starting to spin-up community conversations around these specific goals for drafting CF extensions.)
Another aspect of the funded project is fostering greater community engagement, including the existing CF community,
geoscience domains that have not been very involved in CF, and other standards bodies (e.g. the Open Geospatial Consortium).
These and other topics are on the current list of possible agenda items.

Planned discussion topics include:
* Hierarchical structures for data and metadata
* CF and the netCDF Enhanced Data Model (e.g., CF 2.0)
* CF Discrete Sampling Geometries (DSG) and the netCDF Enhanced Data Model
* netCDF-CF and complex data value footprints (e.g., river segments/networks and drainage basins)
* NetCDF-CF and satellite data
* CFRadial: netCDF-CF and radar data
* UGRID and related
* Dataset Aggregation: various forms
* Linked Data and semantic technologies
* Coordination with OGC netCDF SWG
* Harmonizing CF grid mapping with OGC CRS (coordinate reference systems)
* Support for attribute namespaces and/or URI prefixes
* CF Governance and process
* Capturing information on uncertainty: netCDF-U (and UncertML?)

The organizers are committed to ensuring that a wide range of community interests are represented.
Although the initial deadline for participation in this workshop has passed, if you are interested in attending please contact.

We are also investigating options for remote participation. If you would like to participate electronically, please contact us for information.
