# 2019 netCDF-CF Workshop

The Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata convention for netCDF (netCDF-CF) is a community-developed standard first released in 2003. The CF conventions were originally developed to represent climate and forecast model output encoded in the netCDF binary format, with the specific goal of facilitating comparison of output from different models. Subsequent development of the convention has broadened its scope to include observational data and derived products.

This workshop is focused on discussing current and future efforts and directions for the CF conventions.
 
This two days workshop took place on 16 & 17 July 2019 as four sessions of the 2019 [ESIP][esip] [Summer Meeting][esip2019sm] in Tacoma, WA (USA).
