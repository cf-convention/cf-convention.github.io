# 2020 CF Workshop

## Executive summary
The 2020 CF Workshop took place virtually on 9-11 June 2020. The
meeting ran for 3 hours on each day, 16:00 to 19:00 UTC, and was
followed by a short purely social time for those who could and wanted
to stay on. There was a high level of interest from the CF community,
with 132 people registering from 15 countries (mainly from the
Americas and Europe), and 65 to 90 people attending each day.

The workshop had three main themes: **goverance**, **tools**, and
**current enhancement proposals**.

The **goverance** sesssions (3.5 hours) covered standard names, recent
changes to goverance procedures and the CF committees, the use of
GitHub as the primary repository for CF and a review of recent and
upcoming changes to the conventions.

The **tools** session (1 hour) comprised demonstrations of three
generic tools that could be useful to the CF community - two CF
checkers and a reference implementation of the CF data model. This was
a new addition to recent annual meetings, and one that will surely be
repeated.

The **current enhancement proposals** sessions (3.75 hours) were
devoted to eight breakout discussions, with four occuring in parallel
on each of two days. Seven of the sessions focussed on furthering the
progress of an open enhancement proposals in the GithUb issue tracker,
with the other session devoted to a general discussion on standard
names.

The meeting finished with an overview (0.75 hours) of the topics
covered, and highlighing points raised during the workshop.
Actions resulting from this meeting are tracked in [a dedicated board](https://github.com/orgs/cf-convention/projects/1).
