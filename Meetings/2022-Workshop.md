# 2022 CF Workshop

The Climate and Forecast metadata conventions (CF) are a community-developed standard  designed to promote the processing and sharing of climate and forecast model and observational output data, and derived data products. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The CF convention includes a standard name table, which defines strings that identify physical quantities.

2022 CF Workshop will take place on 13-15 September 2022 hosted by [IFCA] at Santander (Spain). After 2 successful virtual editions ([2020] and [2021]), the 2022 edition is organized as a hybrid event having in-person and on-line participants.

## Training session
In the week prior to the CF Workshop there will be a virtual training event designed for users new or fairly new to CF, which may well be useful to those with more experience, too.
The training will last for 3 hours and will take place on **Thursday 8th September, 1500 - 1800 UTC**.

Details of training programme can be found at the [training section of the CF website][TRAINING].

Pre-registration for the on-line training event is not essential, but to help us with planning please tick the corresponding checkbox, in the [registration form][REGISTRATION], if you would be interested in attending.

For those unable to attend the event itself, the content (including videos of the presentations) will be accessable from the [training section of the CF website][TRAINING]. 

More details at: <https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues/158>

## Hackathon sessions

We will devote roughly half of the time on each day to focused-attention hackathons, during which it is hoped that concrete progress on each topic can be made (such as actual changes suggested to the Conventions text). On each day, two hackathon sessions will run in parallel.

Please express an interest in any number of these sessions, in the [registration form][REGISTRATION], or suggest a new topic that could be included, with a suggestion of who you think could lead the discussion. 

More details at: <https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues/152>

## Poster contributions

During the CF Workshop there will be displays for poster contributions from participants. There will be no formal poster session, but posters are expected to be chatted about informally during breaks.

To help us with planning, please check the "Other" box, in the [registration form][REGISTRATION], and provided a tentative title, if you would be interested to bring your poster.
