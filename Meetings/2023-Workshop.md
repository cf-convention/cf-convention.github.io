# 2023 CF Workshop

The 2023 CF Workshop was a virtual meeting held on 3-5 October 2023.
The meeting ran for three hours on each day, plus an informal hour at the end of each day.
There were just over 40 registered attendees from 8 countries with 20-27 active participants online at most times during the three-day meeting.

Each day began with plenary sessions with topics including standard names, governance and process, lightning talks, and introductions to hackathon topics.
The majority of each day was spent in hackathon sessions.
The hackathon topics included:
* Using requirements key words in CF Conventions, e.g., "MUST", "SHALL", "SHOULD", "MAY" (See issue #[258](https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues/258))
* Can CF use netCDF enumerations to replace CF flags (See issue #[238](https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues/238))
* Enhancing CF to allow localizing NetCDF metadata (see issue #[244](https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues/244))
* Harmonizing precipitation standard names (see issue #[262](https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues/262))
* Adding complex numbers to CF (see issue #[204](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues/204))
* Remove CF restrictions on netCDF object names (see issue #[237](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues/237) and [Overview/Summary slides](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24564295.v1))
* [Conventions for dataset aggregation](https://figshare.com/account/articles/24633939)

The second and third days included lightning talk plenary sessions.
The lightning talk topics were:
* Metadata to Describe Lossy Compression - presented by Charlie Zender (see issue #[403](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues/403))
* [Temperature units in CF](https://figshare.com/account/articles/24633894) - presented by David Hassell
* NetCDF Enumerations - presented by Abel Aoun
* CF Training: where to find existing resources and how to request future topics - presented by Sadie Bartholomew (slides at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24615177.v1)
