The organizing committee requests that all presentations, in final form, be placed in a document repository that provides permanence for the document and a DOI (or other de-referencable PID).
Both [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) provide these services.
Some presenters may also have access to an institutional repository that provide these services.
