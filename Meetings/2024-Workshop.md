# 2024 CF Workshop

The 2024 CF workshop was held at SMHI, Norrköping, Sweden (and online) from Tuesday 17th to Friday 20th September 2024.
Further practical information about the workshop from the host institution can be found at the [SMHI CF Workshop page](https://www.smhi.se/en/research/research-departments/climate-research-at-the-rossby-centre/cf-community-workshop-2024-1.207332). 

The meeting was divided into two parts:

 - **Part 1 (17-18 September 2024): Engaging the cross-domain CF community to gather user needs and develop a high-level CF roadmap.**
 - **Part 2 (19-20 September 2024): Detailed CF development including hackathon sessions.**

During Part I, speakers were invited from a broad range of CF users and potential users, for example, representatives of data producers and data archives in the earth system sciences, the health and biological research communities. Part 2 followed the familiar format of our usual annual meeting.

The aim of the workshop was to maximise the usefulness of CF to a wide range of communities, encourage others to join and contribute to the CF community effort, and enhance interoperability with other widely used standards.
The desired outcome following the workshop will be a publication of the proceedings, including a roadmap for development of the CF conventions and vocabularies over the next 1 to 5 years.

## Attendees

A total of 78 participants registered for the workshop, with around 25-30 of these attending on-site. A breakdown of this information is shown in the following graph;
'Europe' refers to those representing a European organisation such as ECMWF, EUMETSAT or EMODnet.

A range of organisations were represented within the workshop: the affiliations of the presenters can be found underneath the agenda. 


## Documents

All the presentations and notes for the plenary and breakout sessions will be available in this [Google Drive folder][DOC].

The presentations from speakers in Part I are available on the [CF Metadata Conventions Zenodo repository][ZENODO].

## Agenda

In the first part each session began with 1-2 short (10 - 15 min each) keynote presentations to set the scene for the conversation. In addition, 1-2 brief "lightning talks" (5 min each) were given to highlight a particular perspective relevant to the conversation.

For the second part the agenda included a mixture of breakout group discussions and hands-on hackathons.
