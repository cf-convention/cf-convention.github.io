# 2022 CF Training Workshop

The Climate and Forecast metadata conventions (CF) are a community-developed standard designed to promote the processing and sharing of climate and forecast model and observational output data, and derived data products. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The CF convention includes a standard name table, which defines strings that identify physical quantities.

In the week prior to the 2022 CF workshop there will be a virtual training event. This will be the first in a series of training sessions organized by and for the CF community. It is aimed primarily at users new or fairly new to CF, and may also be useful to those with more experience.

# Registration

There are no registration fees for the training session. Pre-registration is not essential, but would help us with planning.

You can register using [this form][REGISTRATION]. (This is also the form to use for registration at the 2022 CF workshop, however there is no obligation to also attend the workshop and it is fine if you only want to attend the training session).
