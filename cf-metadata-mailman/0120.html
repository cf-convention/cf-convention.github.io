<br />
Dear  Jonathan,
<br />
I gave numbers to the outstanding  issues to make it easier to address 
<br />
them next time... My answers start with A:
<br />
1,2, 12, and 13 are still open, 15 and 16 are new proposals.
<br />
<br />1. &gt; snow_basal_heat_flux, Snow basal heat flux, W m-2 
<br />
Can this be called 
<br />
upward|downward_heat_flux_at_ground_level_in_snow
<br />
The corresponding quantity _in_soil is the ground heat flux.
<br />
A: still open
<br />
<br />2. &gt; atmosphere_eastward|northward_stress_due_to_diffusion:Pa
<br />
Are these momentum fluxes directed upwards or downward i.e. tending to
<br />
accelerate the atmosphere below or above the level on which they are 
<br />
given?
<br />
(I realise this is an ambiguity about the gravity-wave stresses too.) 
<br />
Since
<br />
stresses are tensors, they need two signed directions to specify them.
<br />
A: still open
<br />
<br />3. &gt; soil_suction_at_saturation; Saturation soil suction; m
<br />
I am not sufficiently expert to define this. Could you please supply a
<br />
definition of soil suction?
<br />
A: <a href="http://www.geo-observations.com/Information/Whatissoilsuction.html">http://www.geo-observations.com/Information/Whatissoilsuction.html</a>
<br />
It is used for parameterization of land surface processes in models:
<br />
<a href="http://www.lmd.jussieu.fr/pcmdi-mirror/modeldoc/amip2/ukmo_98a/ukmo_a.html">http://www.lmd.jussieu.fr/pcmdi-mirror/modeldoc/amip2/ukmo_98a/ukmo_a.html</a>
<br />
<br />4. &gt; soil_texture; fraction of sand, clay and silt; 1
<br />
We have recently added a string-valued quantity soil_type to identify 
<br />
types
<br />
such as you list. It looks as if you would like to specify some parameter 
<br />
as
<br />
a function of soil type. Is it the mass fraction of the soil?
<br />
A: In the 'texture triangle' 
<br />
(<a href="http://www.pedosphere.com/resources/bulkdensity/triangle_us.cfm">http://www.pedosphere.com/resources/bulkdensity/triangle_us.cfm</a>) there 
<br />
are marked areas  for each soil type, assessing the soil type depending on 
<br />
the volume percentages of components.
<br />
<br />5. &gt; stomatal resistance depends on vegetation type, it is not clear to 
<br />
me, how 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to include min and max into standard name:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stomatal_resistance; Maximum stomatal resistance; s m-1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stomatal_resistance; Minimum stomatal resistance; s m-1
</em><br />
I suppose this could be indicated by cell_methods &quot;vegetation_type: 
<br />
maximum&quot;.
<br />
We have not got standard names for stomatal resistance and vegetation 
<br />
type.
<br />
Are you proposing these?
<br />
A: Yes, stomatal_resistance is the proposal.
<br />
Each vegetation type has its maximum and its minimum, depending on the 
<br />
situation (water supply and temperature).
<br />
<br />6. &gt; surface_direct_downwelling_photosynthetic_radiative_flux; W m-2
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_diffuse_downwelling_photosynthetic_radiative_flux; W m-2
</em><br />
Is it correct that you mean the vertically downward component of the flux
<br />
directly from the sun in the first case, while the second means
<br />
surface_downwelling_photosynthetic_radiative_flux minus
<br />
surface_direct_downwelling_photosynthetic_radiative_flux?
<br />
A: yes
<br />
<br />7. &gt; 
<br />
tendency_of_atmosphere_water_vapor_content_due_to_stable_convection:kg m-2 
<br />
s-1
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_atmosphere_water_vapor_content_due_to_turbulence:kg m-2 s-1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
tendency_of_water_vapor_content_of_atmosphere_layer_due_to_stable_convection:kg 
<br />
m-2 s-1
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency_of_water_vapor_content_of_atmosphere_layer_due_to_turbulence:kg 
</em><br />
m-2 s-1
<br />
Could you define what &quot;turbulence&quot; and &quot;stable convection&quot; mean, please?
<br />
A by A.Ruane: turbulence is &quot;turbulent_mixing&quot; and &quot;stable_convection&quot; 
<br />
should 
<br />
really be &quot;stable_moistening&quot; or &quot;non_convective_moistening&quot;
<br />
<br />8. You define both these quantities as &quot;energy resulting from shift in
<br />
sigma-layer-definition with changing PS&quot;. What is the distinction between 
<br />
the
<br />
two of them? Perhaps the second is in a layer?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;atmosphere_phis:J m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;phis:J m-2
<br />
Is this a commonly used quantity that needs a standard name? It is 
<br />
obviously
<br />
a model quantity, not an observational one, but it should have a name if 
<br />
it
<br />
is being compared among models. However, we would need to give it a more
<br />
self-explanatory name than &quot;phi_s&quot;. Could you please describe it in some 
<br />
more
<br />
detail?
<br />
A: yes, atmosphere_phis is for whole atmosphere, phis is defined for 
<br />
layers.
<br />
perhaps we can use
<br />
energy_residual_due_to_shifting_definition_of_sigma_levels?
<br />
<br />9. In these quantities
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;baseflow_amount:kg m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;runoff_excluding_baseflow_amount:kg m-2
<br />
does &quot;baseflow&quot; mean the flow in rivers which comes from groundwater? You
<br />
define baseflow as &quot;surface runoff plus layer runoff minus baseflow&quot;, 
<br />
which
<br />
seems contradictory, and the second quantity appears to exclude baseflow a
<br />
second time. I haven't grasped the distinctions you are making - could you
<br />
clarify, please?
<br />
A: baseflow = groundwater flow
<br />
&nbsp;runoff_excluding_baseflow = all runoff - baseflow (that means it is 
<br />
surface + subsurface except groundwater flow)
<br />
<br />10.The following come in pairs. What is the distinction between the two 
<br />
varieties?
<br />
Is the shortwave absorption for upwelling or downwelling or both, the last
<br />
being the difference between incoming and outgoing TOA SW? How do you 
<br />
define
<br />
the longwave absorption, given that the atmosphere emits as well as 
<br />
absorbing?
<br />
By the energy released by convection do you mean the latent heat released 
<br />
by
<br />
condensation during convection (corresponding to large-scale)?  In 
<br />
condensation
<br />
do you include freezing?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rate_of_absorption_of_shortwave_energy:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;atmosphere_rate_of_absorption_of_shortwave_energy:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rate_of_absorption_of_longwave_energy:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;atmosphere_rate_of_absorption_of_longwave_energy:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rate_of_energy_released_by_deep_convection:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;atmosphere_rate_of_energy_released_by_deep_convection:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rate_of_energy_released_by_shallow_convection:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;atmosphere_rate_of_energy_released_by_shallow_convection:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rate_of_energy_released_by_large_scale_condensation:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;atmosphere_rate_of_energy_released_by_large_scale_condensation:W m-2
<br />
I am wondering whether we can use the word &quot;power&quot; in names for these
<br />
quantities instead of &quot;rate of X&quot; where X is a kind of energy conversion.
<br />
Power (strictly per unit area) is the correct physical term, of course, 
<br />
but
<br />
not often used in meteorology.
<br />
A:  atmosphere_ is the value for the whole atmosphere, the other one is 
<br />
layer defined
<br />
by A.Ruane: This variables  refers 
<br />
to net radiative effect.  That means they refer to the rate of energy 
<br />
absorbed/emitted in the shortwave spectra, so a layer would have a 
<br />
positive value if it absorbed more shortwave radiation than it emitted. 
<br />
Therefore, none of the above options are correct, as it is both upward and 
<br />
<br />downward shortwave energy.  I would call it: 
<br />
rate_of_absorption_of_net_shortwave_energy: W m-2
<br />
This is not the same as a TOA difference, particularly for those 
<br />
interested in specific atmospheric layers and the vertical column integral 
<br />
<br />will differ from the TOA difference due to absorption of the land surface 
<br />
and any discrepancies in the model's radiation budget.  The longwave is 
<br />
described in the same way:
<br />
rate_of_absorption_of_net_longwave_energy: W m-2
<br />
this may be confusing to some people, as there will often be negative 
<br />
net absorption (e.g. emission dominating absorption), but it is consistent 
<br />
<br />with our wording.  The clearest alternatives would be to call them: 
<br />
power_due_to_shortwave_energy: W m-2
<br />
power_due_to_longwave_energy: W m-2
<br />
<br />11. I'm not clear which &quot;energy&quot; is referred to in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;energy_of_atmosphere_layer:J m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_energy_transport_in_air:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_atmosphere_energy_transport:W m-2
<br />
Is it the moist energy? (See 1st December posting.)
<br />
A: energy_of_atmosphere_layer:J m-2 should be 
<br />
dry_energy_content_of_atmosphere_layer:J m-2 (already in list)
<br />
horizontal_dry_energy_transport_in_air:W m-2 for layer-variable and 
<br />
horizontal_atmosphere_dry_energy_transport:W m-2 
<br />
<br />12. What energy is being referred to in these quantities?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;eastward_energy_flux_in_air; W m-1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;upward_energy_flux_in_air; W m-1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;northward_energy_flux_in_air; W m-1
<br />
A: still open
<br />
<br />13.We have atmosphere_energy_content in the table at present, but it is 
<br />
not
<br />
really defined what it means. What do you mean by it in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_atmosphere_energy_content:W m-2
<br />
A: still open
<br />
<br />14. For these 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_enthalpy_transport_in_air:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_geopotential_energy_transport_in_air:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_kinetic_energy_transport_in_air:W m-2
<br />
we already have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_atmosphere_enthalpy_content_due_to_advection:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_atmosphere_potential_energy_content_due_to_advection:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_atmosphere_kinetic_energy_content_due_to_advection:W m-2
<br />
Are they what you want? If so, what is the difference between these and 
<br />
the set
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_atmosphere_enthalpy_transport:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_atmosphere_geopotential_energy_transport:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_atmosphere_kinetic_energy_transport:W m-2
<br />
You describe this set as &quot;mass weighted&quot; but I am unclear what distinction
<br />
is being made, since both sets of quantities are in W m-2.
<br />
A:
<br />
instead of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_atmosphere_enthalpy_transport:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_atmosphere_geopotential_energy_transport:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_atmosphere_kinetic_energy_transport:W m-2
<br />
we can use 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_atmosphere_enthalpy_content_due_to_advection:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_atmosphere_potential_energy_content_due_to_advection:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_atmosphere_kinetic_energy_content_due_to_advection:W m-2
<br />
&quot;mass weighted&quot; is the way of calculation the vertical integral, it is the 
<br />
normal way, so we don't have to mention it especially
<br />
layer variables
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_enthalpy_transport_in_air:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_geopotential_energy_transport_in_air:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal_kinetic_energy_transport_in_air:W m-2
<br />
could be then
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_enthalpy_content_due_to_advection_in_air:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_potential_energy_content_due_to_advection_in_air:W m-2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency_of_kinetic_energy_content_due_to_advection_in_air:W m-2
<br />
<br /><br />15. two additional soil parameters concerning energy
<br />
soil_thermal_capacity; J kg-1 K-1
<br />
soil_thermal_conductivity; W m-1 K-1
<br />
<br />16. one additional variable concerning water in soil
<br />
volume_fraction_of_water_in_soil_at_critical_point
<br />
