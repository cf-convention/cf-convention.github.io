Dear Christiane et al.
<br />
<br />Regarding Roy's comment, it would be fair to say that these names do already
<br />
result from consultation among some experts on atmos chemistry within your
<br />
group, wouldn't it? I think what is mostly needed here is comments on how
<br />
chemical names of this kind fit with CF standard names in general. Roy's
<br />
comment shows that they may need to be more self-explanatory. It is generally
<br />
the case that we have to make standard names more explicit than domain experts
<br />
would expect, so that people from other disciplines can understand them
<br />
easily. That kind of issue has occurred before, with meteorologists assuming
<br />
that oceanographers will understand them and vice-versa, etc.
<br />
<br />Sorry for my slow response. I have a few comments.
<br />
<br />On names of species:
<br />
<br />* The construction X_as_Y seems fine to me, to indicate that you mean X when it
<br />
comes as a constituent of Y. But it some cases I wonder if it is really
<br />
necessary. What is meant by ammonium_as_ammonium? 
<br />
<br />* You have organic_carbon_as_particulate_organic_carbon_dry_aerosol and
<br />
organic_carbon_as_particulate_organic_carbon_dry_aerosol. In these cases, could
<br />
you not omit the first &quot;organic&quot;? - since carbon is carbon, and whether it is
<br />
organic depends on what it is a constituent of.
<br />
<br />* How can you have a wet deposition flux of a dry aerosol? What does &quot;dry
<br />
aerosol&quot; mean, I wonder.
<br />
<br />* Like Roy, I don't know what mercury_0 and mercury_2 mean.
<br />
<br />* I don't understand aerosol_water_ambient_aerosol.
<br />
<br />* I can understand non_methane_volatile_organic_compounds but I don't know what
<br />
they are. Are they a well-known group so that this is obvious to an expert?
<br />
Later they appear as NMVOC. I think we should have one or the other, and
<br />
putting it in full seems more consistent with your other names.
<br />
<br />* CO should appear as carbon_monoxide.
<br />
<br />Use of dimensions:
<br />
<br />* Some of the names have numerical values in them. This is not in keeping with
<br />
usual practice in standard names. For instance, we do not have standard names
<br />
for surface air temperature at 1.5 m or 2 m height. Instead, we use coordinates
<br />
for independent variables. In names like these:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;mole_fraction_of_CO_with_lifetime_of_25_days_in_air
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;pm10_aerosol_ambient_optical_depth_at_550_nm
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;mass_fraction_of_pm10_aerosol_at_50_percent_relative_humidity_in_air
<br />
I think the lifetime, particle radius, wavelength and relative humidity should
<br />
be coordinates (probably scalar coordinate variables), rather than being in the
<br />
standard name. This requires standard names to be defined for the independent
<br />
variables you need.
<br />
<br />* In a similar way, you have phrases from_North_America, from_South_Asia and so
<br />
on. I know this is similar to the construction from_stratosphere which we
<br />
discussed in your guidelines, but I don't think we ought to include geo-
<br />
graphical areas in standard names. We have already defined a standard_name of
<br />
region for use as a geographical &quot;coordinate&quot;. Your use is not quite the same
<br />
because you want to identify where something comes from, rather than its
<br />
present location, so perhaps we should introduce a new name of source_region
<br />
for instance, with the same possible values as region; these come from a list
<br />
which can be extended as required.
<br />
<br />Other points:
<br />
<br />* grid_cell_area and _height. These are metrics for the grid, rather than
<br />
quantities which need standard names. Grid cell area should be specified by a
<br />
cell_measures variable of area (CF 7.2). Grid cell height can be deduced as the
<br />
difference between the lower and upper boundary in the vertical coordinate. If
<br />
it has to be stored separately we could add a cell_measures for it.
<br />
<br />* atmosphere_mass_content_of_air. I think we agreed this would be named in the
<br />
more obvious way atmosphere_mass_per_unit_area, since it seems strange to
<br />
give something a &quot;content&quot; name for its entire content!
<br />
<br />* &quot;of&quot; is missing in surface_emission_mass_flux_ammonia.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
