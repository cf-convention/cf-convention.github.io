<br />
Dear all,
<br />
<br />I have to reckon that I was a bit confused by the huge amount of 
<br />
information received in the last few days. After reading them carefully, 
<br />
below there is some comments in as a structured way as I found possible:
<br />
<br />- I agree that the whole issue of dealing with ensembles, multi-models, 
<br />
multi-forecast systems, operational systems, etc. is far from obvious. I 
<br />
guess that is the reason why the job was not done before.
<br />
<br />- Please, bear in mind that if I used the project ENSEMBLES as an 
<br />
example, or Jamie the IPCC, it's only as an illustration. My intention 
<br />
has been since the beginning to try to propose a solution to make NetCDF 
<br />
more useful and attractive to **operational forecasting centres**. The 
<br />
word operational is key here. It's not by chance that institutions such 
<br />
as NCEP, UK Met Office, JMA or ECMWF do not disseminate their daily 
<br />
operational ensemble products in NetCDF format.
<br />
<br />- My original intention when started this discussion was to find a clear 
<br />
way of writing files with multi-forecast system ensemble integrations. 
<br />
In response to John's message, this means being able to write all the 
<br />
members of an ensemble (coming from either several forecast systems or 
<br />
from a single one) in a single file and being able to identify them. Of 
<br />
course, the type of file may change with the user: in the context of a 
<br />
multi-model, the contributors might prefer to prepare files with the 
<br />
ensemble forecasts produced with their own individual models if they run 
<br />
them in separate institutions, while in a perturbed-physics context a 
<br />
single institution will prefer to write the forecasts from the different 
<br />
model versions in a single file.
<br />
<br />- Bryan wonders about the adequacy of defining specific variable 
<br />
metadata in multi-forecast system files to distinguish ensemble member, 
<br />
model, system and so on, and compares this problem with the interest of 
<br />
having additional informative metadata in a file containing station 
<br />
data. In my opinion, the essential difference is that a file with 
<br />
multi-forecast system ensemble simulations is not a simple gathering of 
<br />
predictions from different sources or with different initial conditions, 
<br />
but a complete forecast in itself. The additional metadata is not a 
<br />
wish, but a need to describe an entity. Without the appropriate metadata 
<br />
the file is not self-descriptive and won't be operationally 
<br />
disseminated, in the same way that operational centres don't disseminate 
<br />
deterministic forecasts in any format without clearly specifying the 
<br />
forecast system.
<br />
<br />- I understood at the beginning that the main interest of NetCDF is that 
<br />
one doesn't need to rely on external tables to identify the data. While 
<br />
the use of external vocabularies might offer a simple way of avoiding 
<br />
the creation of additional metadata, it uses a strategy that I presumed 
<br />
made the difference between NetCDF and GRIB: the use of external tables 
<br />
and extensions. In my opinion, Bryan is right: the core of the 
<br />
discussion is issue D. However, from my experience with operational 
<br />
ensembles, forecasters may make the move from GRIB1 to GRIB2 without 
<br />
paying much attention to the use of NetCDF due the lack of rules to 
<br />
encode the operational forecasts in NetCDF. Maybe WMO/IPCC should take 
<br />
the lead on this.
<br />
<br />- Of course, an immediate issue, as John and Bryan have identified, is 
<br />
how to disseminate these files using a THREDDS Data Server. At present, 
<br />
the largest file I can imagine would have as dimensions 
<br />
(realization,forecast_reference_time,forecast_period,lev,lat,lon). The 
<br />
most likely integrations, in my opinion, would take place on the 
<br />
dimensions realization and forecast_reference_time. In ENSEMBLES, we 
<br />
plan to work with NetCDF, although we try to learn from what is done 
<br />
with GRIB2 in TIGGE.
<br />
<br />- In case the option of adding standard names (instead of the use of 
<br />
external vocabularies) is accepted, I'd like to propose the standard 
<br />
name &quot;ensemble_member&quot; in lieu of the suggested &quot;initial_condition&quot;. It 
<br />
could be used as an integer to tag the members of the ensemble 
<br />
identified with particular values of &quot;experiment_id&quot;, &quot;source&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;institution&quot;, regardless of the way the initial conditions of the 
<br />
ensemble have been generated.
<br />
<br />Apologies for the long message.
<br />
Best regards,
<br />
Paco
