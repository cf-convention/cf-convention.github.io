<br />
All,
<br />
<br />Like others I've watched this email thread grow like Topsy, wondering if 
<br />
I would find the time to read it.   At last I did this morning.  So here 
<br />
is yet another message that has to begin with an apology that this 
<br />
discussion is a lot to get one's arms around, and with bowing and 
<br />
scraping for the mistakes of interpretation that I will doubtlessly 
<br />
make.  I'll doubly apologize for wading in as a late-arriving 
<br />
trouble-maker.  But the discussion topic seems big enough to warrant a 
<br />
fair amount of rough and tumble.
<br />
<br />I'd like to ask that we step back for a moment to talk about the long 
<br />
term evolution and stability of CF.  There is pretty wide agreement that 
<br />
in the past, when thinking of how models might spit out their outputs, 
<br />
we have often not given adequate weight to the issues of software that 
<br />
read the data.  We want to guard the simplicity and stability of the CF 
<br />
standard to the degree that we can.  The quotation that Russ Rew brought 
<br />
into our discussions at June's GO-ESSP meeting is a valuable reference 
<br />
point:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create quality software [or standards], the ability to say &quot;no&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is usually far  more important than the ability to say &quot;yes.&quot;
<br />
<br />OK.  Enuf preamble.  In a nutshell, the new proposed structures seem to 
<br />
capture the semantics of the various collections of model outputs -- 
<br />
ensembles and forecast collections -- through the addition of new 
<br />
dimensions.  In the most extreme case this dimension list might become 
<br />
(realization,forecast_reference_time,forecast_period,lev,lat,lon).
<br />
<br />I'd pose two questions:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Will this approach break existing CF applications?  If yes, is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a red flag to consider other options?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Is this the same approach that we would take if we already had
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;netCDF 4?  If no, is that a red flag that we should give more
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought to the long-term stability of the standard?
<br />
<br />Thinking in terms of netCDF 4: would we solve this question by adding 
<br />
new dimensions to the basic CF 4-dimensional outlook?  Or would we 
<br />
instead use the new concept of &quot;groups&quot;?  I suspect that we would use 
<br />
groups.  Doing so would preserve intact the basic 4D CF structure (the 
<br />
&quot;CF nut&quot;) that encapsulates the output of a single geophysical model 
<br />
run.  It would define a smoother incremental growth path for the 
<br />
software that reads the data.  And it would provide a bigger space than 
<br />
just additional dimensions in which to capture the growing complexity of 
<br />
the models -- time dependent coordinates, unstructured grids, etc.
<br />
<br />How could we achieve the equivalent effect within the more limited tool 
<br />
set of netCDF 3?  I think John Caron's &quot;Forecast aggregation server&quot; 
<br />
illustrates a solution.  Namely, use the THREDDS catalog as the place to 
<br />
embed the new, higher-level structures -- membership in a forecast 
<br />
aggregation and/or an ensemble.  This approach preserves the &quot;CF nut&quot; -- 
<br />
the basic 4D structure that describes a dataset.  It preserves backwards 
<br />
compatibility for existing applications.  It gives full access to the 
<br />
ensemble and forecast dimensions for newly written or modified 
<br />
software.  And it segues smoothly into next-generation netCDF 4 structures.
<br />
<br />Admittedly, this approach represents a compromise -- it does not provide 
<br />
a way to capture all of the complexity in a single, local file in the 
<br />
short term.  But this objection, if a major barrier, could probably be 
<br />
largely overcome through the creation of some fairly modest code 
<br />
libraries (building on TDS) that expose THREDDS-like navigation 
<br />
capabilities over collections of local files.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have to reckon that I was a bit confused by the huge amount of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information received in the last few days. After reading them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carefully, below there is some comments in as a structured way as I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; found possible:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - I agree that the whole issue of dealing with ensembles, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-models, multi-forecast systems, operational systems, etc. is far 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from obvious. I guess that is the reason why the job was not done before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Please, bear in mind that if I used the project ENSEMBLES as an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, or Jamie the IPCC, it's only as an illustration. My intention 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been since the beginning to try to propose a solution to make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NetCDF more useful and attractive to **operational forecasting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; centres**. The word operational is key here. It's not by chance that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; institutions such as NCEP, UK Met Office, JMA or ECMWF do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disseminate their daily operational ensemble products in NetCDF format.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - My original intention when started this discussion was to find a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear way of writing files with multi-forecast system ensemble 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integrations. In response to John's message, this means being able to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write all the members of an ensemble (coming from either several 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forecast systems or from a single one) in a single file and being able 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to identify them. Of course, the type of file may change with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; user: in the context of a multi-model, the contributors might prefer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to prepare files with the ensemble forecasts produced with their own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual models if they run them in separate institutions, while in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a perturbed-physics context a single institution will prefer to write 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the forecasts from the different model versions in a single file.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Bryan wonders about the adequacy of defining specific variable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metadata in multi-forecast system files to distinguish ensemble 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; member, model, system and so on, and compares this problem with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interest of having additional informative metadata in a file 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing station data. In my opinion, the essential difference is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a file with multi-forecast system ensemble simulations is not a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple gathering of predictions from different sources or with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different initial conditions, but a complete forecast in itself. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; additional metadata is not a wish, but a need to describe an entity. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Without the appropriate metadata the file is not self-descriptive and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; won't be operationally disseminated, in the same way that operational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; centres don't disseminate deterministic forecasts in any format 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without clearly specifying the forecast system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - I understood at the beginning that the main interest of NetCDF is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one doesn't need to rely on external tables to identify the data. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While the use of external vocabularies might offer a simple way of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; avoiding the creation of additional metadata, it uses a strategy that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I presumed made the difference between NetCDF and GRIB: the use of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external tables and extensions. In my opinion, Bryan is right: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; core of the discussion is issue D. However, from my experience with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operational ensembles, forecasters may make the move from GRIB1 to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; GRIB2 without paying much attention to the use of NetCDF due the lack 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of rules to encode the operational forecasts in NetCDF. Maybe WMO/IPCC 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should take the lead on this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Of course, an immediate issue, as John and Bryan have identified, is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how to disseminate these files using a THREDDS Data Server. At 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present, the largest file I can imagine would have as dimensions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (realization,forecast_reference_time,forecast_period,lev,lat,lon). The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most likely integrations, in my opinion, would take place on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensions realization and forecast_reference_time. In ENSEMBLES, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plan to work with NetCDF, although we try to learn from what is done 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with GRIB2 in TIGGE.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - In case the option of adding standard names (instead of the use of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external vocabularies) is accepted, I'd like to propose the standard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; name &quot;ensemble_member&quot; in lieu of the suggested &quot;initial_condition&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It could be used as an integer to tag the members of the ensemble 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identified with particular values of &quot;experiment_id&quot;, &quot;source&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;institution&quot;, regardless of the way the initial conditions of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensemble have been generated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apologies for the long message.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best regards,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Paco
