Hi Jonathan
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In that situation all we are saying is that - nope, yours is the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; code that can understand that data! If you want others to read it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; without writing new code, you may need to rewrite it! That's fair!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I don't think it's fair. It is imposing a burden on people to redo what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they have done, because the CF community was too slow in making a decision.
</em><br />
<br />It's not just the decision it's the implementation. All proper software
<br />
development efforts (and let's be clear the reason for doing this is
<br />
about being able to write code) proceed in a loop from 
<br />
&nbsp;use cases 
<br />
to
<br />
&nbsp;requirements
<br />
to 
<br />
&nbsp;coding 
<br />
which often requires realising that changing the requirements might
<br />
be better, which then means revising the use case to make sure the
<br />
changed requirements don't impact on the use case (and sometimes then
<br />
saying: do we really need the use case, we can't afford the
<br />
consequences?).
<br />
<br />All this takes time. And what you're arguing for imposes the burden
<br />
somewhere else, and it's an expensive burden, which is much harder to
<br />
hide than the burden of time contributing to discussions.
<br />
<br />Be in no doubt. I want this to happen. I want it to happen quickly, but
<br />
it's much easier to propose this than make it useful - no matter how
<br />
good the use case.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree. We have only discussed and agreed things when people said they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed them. I think it is unlikely that there is any single codebase that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supports all of it, but I expect that nearly all of it has been used some-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where to *write* data at least, if not to read it. Because data exists for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; longer and is harder to rewrite than software, we have to be very cautious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about changing a convention once it has been agreed.
</em><br />
<br />Huh? Are you really arguing for what I call a WORN archive: Write Once
<br />
Read Never ??? 
<br />
<br />Remember I run an archive with the mandate to keep digital data in
<br />
perpetuity, and it's no help whatsoever for me to write data without
<br />
conforming tools. We can write our own tools, but the whole reason for
<br />
going down this route is so that we can exploit each others work rather
<br />
than keep writing all our own tools!
<br />
<br />I'm afraid that your argument reduces to &quot;thou must document what you
<br />
write!&quot; (agreed, but it's not the complete story).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I'm actually arguing for finding a CF version 0.9 which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; somewhere between COARDS and CF 1.0, but which at least some folk have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; completely implemented).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think we should do that. We have more than enough to do with new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventions without revisiting all that we have previously decided over many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years, and which is now in use.
</em><br />
<br />Depends on your definition of &quot;in use&quot;. There is no point in having a
<br />
&quot;standard&quot; or &quot;convention&quot; in that case. To take this argument to the
<br />
point of absurdity. I could write a one hundred paragraph document, each
<br />
paragraph could be implemented by one person and one person only. In
<br />
what way would this be a convention or standard? (It might be a useful
<br />
documentation effort, but that's a different argument).
<br />
<br />I agree that creating CF 0.9 wouldn't take us very far, but it would be
<br />
illuminating to know what has been implemented!
<br />
<br />Bryan
