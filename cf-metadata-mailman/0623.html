Dear Roy
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still think having separate vocabularies for separate metadata attributes is the better way to go.  I would prefer two vocabularies with overlapping term sets to the the possibility of populating a field with an inappropriate term.  If the metadata attributes pertain to clearly different entities then so too will the vocabularies. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having separate vocabularies permits automated population protection on each attribute - it's amazing how easy it is to select the wrong item from a drop-down list through an unintentional slip of the mouse.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for this. I would be perfectly happy to use different attributes to name
<br />
&quot;quantities&quot; which can and can't be given a standard name, provided a clear
<br />
requirement for this distinction can be stated, and a way to make it in
<br />
practice. Otherwise I don't see how we would decide which is which. If the
<br />
two vocabularies could even be overlapping, it would confirm my suspicion that
<br />
there is no distinction to be drawn; we would in effect have two synonymous
<br />
attributes. That would be an unhelpful complexity.
<br />
<br />Quite likely I am being unperceptive, and someone can say what distinction is
<br />
to be made. Below I repeat my earlier unsuccessful attempts to identify one.
<br />
So far this feels like trying to reach the end of the rainbow! But as Steve has
<br />
said, the way to introduce changes should be to start with a requirement (we
<br />
may have divergent views on the degree of formality needed in that step), not
<br />
try to invent one post-hoc to justify something.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br />Here are some distinctions which *don't* seem to work well:
<br />
<br />* We could say string-valued things are not given standard names. But we have
<br />
region as a standard name with string values, identifying geographical areas
<br />
such as atlantic_ocean, for labelling the ocean overturning streamfunction.
<br />
This function is very similar to numerical geographical coordinates. It would
<br />
be strange to use standard name for latitude and longitude to describe a
<br />
rectangular region, but to say that the label for a non-rectangular region is
<br />
not a standard name. Similarly, land cover types have standard names. They are
<br />
labelling parts of gridboxes which aren't geographically delineated, so again
<br />
are acting as a sort of spatial coordinate.
<br />
<br />* Things which you aren't going to &quot;operate&quot; on are not standard names i.e.
<br />
they're just labels. However, possibly the commonest thing to do with the
<br />
numerical spatiotemporal coordinates is to subset them, and you may well do
<br />
that with the ensemble metadata too. It is also possibly you might combine
<br />
them or process them in other ways.
<br />
<br />* Quantities which could never be data variables should not be given standard
<br />
names. It does seem quite unlikely that source, institution and experiment_id
<br />
might form the contents of a data variable. (In fact it would be hard to do
<br />
until netCDF-4, since they are string-valued, but it could be done using
<br />
flag_values and flag_meanings.) But I don't think it's impossible. I can
<br />
imagine constructing a lat-lon field which indicates which model, at each
<br />
point, had the most realistic value of a quantity, for example.
