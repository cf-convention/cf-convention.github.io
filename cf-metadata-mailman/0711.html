Dear Steve
<br />
<br />(I've changed the subject to make a different thread.)
<br />
<br />The issue of which aspects of description to put in the standard name, versus
<br />
other attributes, is as old as the CF standard, as you know. Unlike GRIB and
<br />
PCMDI names, for example, we regard air_temperature as a standard name, but
<br />
its level (1.5 m above the ground) and time processing (daily minimum) are
<br />
contained in other metadata items (coordinates and cell_methods respectively).
<br />
That's an arbitrary choice, like everything in the convention.
<br />
<br />I feel that it is useful to &quot;factorise&quot; out those categories which are (a)
<br />
relevant in many or most cases and/or (b) which have a large or infinite
<br />
number of values. If (a) applies, then the extra complexity of the metadata
<br />
design (more attributes etc. being needed) is outweighed by the convenience of
<br />
not having to parse the standard_name. If (b) applies, the factorisation
<br />
greatly reduces the number of standard_names we have to define. If we put
<br />
every possible distinction which is currently represented by standard names
<br />
into its own category, requiring a separate attribute or variable for it, that
<br />
would be in effect setting up a colossal matrix of metadata categories which
<br />
would be extremely sparsely populated. I don't think that would so convenient
<br />
for users.
<br />
<br />For example, &quot;air&quot; and &quot;temperature&quot; could be separate attributes, but I think
<br />
it would be inconvenient to have to search a dataset for the combination of
<br />
those two attributes rather than the standard name of air_temperature. On the
<br />
other hand, I think it is sensible to have &quot;daily maximum&quot;, &quot;daily minimum&quot;
<br />
and &quot;daily mean&quot; described by cell_methods rather than in the standard name
<br />
as this distinction could apply to many quantities. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; some other attribute of the variable (cell_methods, long_name, or maybe the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; name of the variable, itself) is used to sort out the distinctions.
</em><br />
<br />NB long_name is not standardised, and we say in the standard that the name of
<br />
the variable itself has no significance. But the general point is that you
<br />
do need sufficient categories to be able to distinguish all the variables in
<br />
your dataset.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; we also have families of standard names 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based upon &quot;...transport_due_to ...&quot;, &quot;...thickness_defined_by_...&quot;,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and  &quot;...tendency_of_..._due_to_...&quot;.    This latter approach might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggest adding a family of  names &quot;realization_weight_based_upon_...&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I would agree with that kind of suggestion in this case, because I suspect that
<br />
this category (method of derivation of realization weights) is one which is
<br />
particular to a small set of variables (realization weights) and hence does
<br />
not need a separate attribute. But if Jamie's use-cases suggest, on the other
<br />
hand, that it has a very large number of possible values, it would be a case
<br />
of (b) above and would need a separate attribute to prevent unwieldy expansion
<br />
of the standard name table. The families you mention result from our adopting
<br />
fairly systematic guidelines for constructing standard names. The reason for
<br />
that is to make them easier to understand, as they have a consistent style and
<br />
terminology as far as possible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; P.S. We also have &quot;product_of_...&quot; variables, which points to the need 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for another level of naming that is above, rather than below the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental quantities.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so, because there are not very many of these. Moreover many
<br />
quantities *could* be described as products. For example, specific humidity
<br />
could be named as the product of relative humidity and saturation specific
<br />
humidity, or conversely relative humidity could be named as the ratio of
<br />
specific humidity to saturation specific humidity. We don't do that because
<br />
they aren't the usual names. In some cases, however, describing something as
<br />
a product has seemed to be the clearest choice. It's just an arbitary choice.
<br />
The product rule is one of the guidelines for construction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But future software that tries to work with standard names is going to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find itself parsing our current names to discover the underlying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; families and sifting through other attributes to understand the deeper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantics.  That seems to defeat our intent that the semantics of CF 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables are captured in the standard names for easy usage by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clients.   In my opinion, these overloading techniques taken 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collectively seem to be crying out for a more general, multi-level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naming solution.
</em><br />
<br />I sympathise with the sentiment but for practical reasons I am not convinced,
<br />
personally. I think this is an instance of trying to foresee needs that we
<br />
have not identified in practice, and setting up an abstract structure that
<br />
may not really be required. I think use-cases and the balance of convenience
<br />
among different situations should determine what factorisation we do. There
<br />
are many ways in which standard names could be grouped, for example, but only
<br />
one such hierarchy could be implemented in the names themselves. A more
<br />
flexible approach, I think, is to use additional databases which categorise
<br />
the names in different ways for different purposes. There is no reason why we
<br />
should not record commonly needed categories in the standard name table itself,
<br />
but not in the standard names. For instance, we could mark those standard names
<br />
which are components of vectors, or record this information in some other
<br />
table, if there is a common need for that information.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
