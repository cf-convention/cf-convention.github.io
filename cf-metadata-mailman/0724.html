Dear Steve and Balaji,
<br />
<br />Thanks for bringing back the issue of CF and the ensemble axis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    1. The ensemble axis proposal does not solve the general multi-model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       ensemble problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           * In earlier discussions it was stated that the ensemble axis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             is intended to address multi-model ensembles.  But the model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             runs in a multi-model ensemble will in general be on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             number of differing grids.  The proposal addresses only the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             limited sub-case in which all models have been re-gridded to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             the same grid.  This leaves unanswered how CF can support
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             ensembles on multiple grids.  We should explore the answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             to the general question before committing to the specialized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             solution.
</em><br />
The original proposal concerned multi-forecast system ensembles. This 
<br />
includes initial-condition ensembles, perturbed-parameter ensembles and 
<br />
multi-models. It is likely that the first two systems have the same grid 
<br />
in all the forecasts, because they would be generated by the same model 
<br />
version. I wouldn't call these examples a limited sub-case.
<br />
Solving the question of how to handle multiple grids in the same file 
<br />
before introducing the ensemble dimension would be ideal, but in the 
<br />
meantime the dissemination of standard NetCDF files with all sorts of 
<br />
ensembles forecasts is limited.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    2. A netCDF-style ensemble axis is a marginal model for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       underlying problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           * The &quot;ensemble axis&quot; is not an ordered axis.  So when clients
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             are working with models from an ensemble they will often not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             be accessing contiguous ranges of indices on the axis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             NetCDF dimensions are ordered and can only provide direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             API support for contiguous ranges on a dimension.   So the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             ensemble axis proposal will not provide the usual and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             expected benefits of a netCDF dimension.
</em><br />
I agree that the treatment of the ensemble dimension is far from 
<br />
perfect. However, I don't understand why dimensions can only provide 
<br />
direct support for contiguous ranges. In a NetCDF file with various 
<br />
(deterministic) forecasts, the variables &quot;forecast_reference_time&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;forecast_period&quot; can be used in CF to determine the verifying time of 
<br />
the forecast. Although these variables are referenced (at least one of 
<br />
them with respect to a calendar), they don't need to be continuous in 
<br />
range as forecasts can also be unequally spaced in time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    4. In realistic data management scenarios the ensemble axis will not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       be a sufficient solution to the problem;  &quot;aggregation servers&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       will be needed as well.  (And when aggregation servers are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       introduced into the problem space, there are alternative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       approaches that should be considered, too.)
</em><br />
We have created an example of aggregation server that contains 
<br />
multi-model ensemble data:
<br />
<a href="http://ensembles.ecmwf.int/thredds/catalog.html">http://ensembles.ecmwf.int/thredds/catalog.html</a>
<br />
This is an effort to satisfy the need of the community to access 
<br />
forecast data in an efficient way (of course, we can rewrite the files 
<br />
once a consensus has been reached, be it a modified version of the 
<br />
&quot;ensembles&quot; proposal or the use NetCDF4). Although the files are big, 
<br />
the system seems to cope fine with them. Forecasts from additional 
<br />
models might be added in the near future, but as they will be identified 
<br />
with the variables &quot;source&quot;, &quot;institution&quot;, &quot;experiment_id&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;realization&quot; (some of them are not considered as global attributes any 
<br />
more), there shouldn't be any problem in being social. However, this 
<br />
dataset has been created with the individual model outputs taking into 
<br />
account the other contributors, which, as you point out, won't be the 
<br />
general case.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    5. If implemented the proposal will create significant barriers to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       interoperability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           * CF1.0 has created the highest level of model-sharing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             interoperability that our community has ever seen. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             Interoperability is arguably the greatest contribution that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             CF has made.  (It is for this reason, for example, that ESRI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             products have begun to support CF.)  Many clients that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             currently capable of reading CF 1.0 will not be able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             access model outputs that utilize this proposal.  The scope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             of this problem -- weighing the benefits against the losses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             -- deserves to be discussed and assessed.
</em><br />
You're right. The use of a fifth dimension prevents Grads and Ferret 
<br />
(among others) from handling the files. However, to my knowledge, the 
<br />
inability of those clients to work with a fifth dimension made the users 
<br />
of ensembles forecasts to not use them and search for alternatives such 
<br />
as R, IDL or MATLAB.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    6. The proposal potentially compromises the future quality of CF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       because netCDF 4 will offer solutions that model the problem properly.
</em><br />
When is netCDF4 expected to be available to start writing ensemble 
<br />
forecast files?
<br />
<br />My message is that there is a demand for standardized NetCDF ensemble 
<br />
forecast files. Shouldn't the adoption of a CF standard to write those 
<br />
files depend on when an alternative, more adequate solution is available?
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
Paco
<br />
