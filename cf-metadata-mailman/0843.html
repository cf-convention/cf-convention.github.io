Dear Heinke and Alison
<br />
<br />This is a response to Alison's posting. I expect and hope that we will be able
<br />
to discuss the general point in Paris, but we will be short of time there. As
<br />
this requires a lot of thinking, I thought it would be useful to send this now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Forty-one new names are proposed for indices that describe aspects of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; climate variability.  The proposed names describe rather different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantities to any that currently exist in the table. 
</em><br />
<br />Alison's analysis of this proposal is very useful, I think, and I generally
<br />
agree with her. In the following, I have attempted to digest the names a bit
<br />
more. Many of them have definitions which require the combination of the
<br />
specification of a physical quantity with the value of a parameter, where the
<br />
parameter appears to Alison and me to be most naturally expressed as a
<br />
coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable in CF. This isn't a new
<br />
kind of situation, but it is an issue worth thinking about.
<br />
<br />It is rather similar to the definition of &quot;surface air temperature&quot;. In CF we
<br />
describe this with a standard_name of air_temperature and a vertical
<br />
coordinate of e.g. 1.5 m or 2.0 m. In many other tables of parameters, such as
<br />
GRIB and PCMDI, &quot;surface air temperature&quot; is a possible value of a single
<br />
attribute, and the definition of the quantity isn't split up as it is in CF.
<br />
We decided on the CF approach because it is more general and it reduces the
<br />
size of the standard name table by &quot;factorising&quot; the information. We could
<br />
have taken this approach further and made the standard name table more
<br />
hierarchical. The approach we have followed is a middle way, I think, which
<br />
splits off specifications of the values of continuously variable parameters
<br />
(such as height), and attributes which could be combined with *any* standard
<br />
name (such as the indication of a time-mean).
<br />
<br />If people are manipulating data from PCMDI, for instance, they might well look
<br />
for the data variable whose name is &quot;tas&quot;, which they know to be surface air
<br />
temperature. If the data is CF-compliant, it will be described by standard
<br />
name and vertical coordinate. The name &quot;tas&quot; thus labels a &quot;bundle&quot; of
<br />
metadata which defines surface air temperature. It seems that CF metadata is
<br />
principally useful for giving a precise description of the quantity; it allows
<br />
us to distinguish between variables or decide whether they are comparable. CF
<br />
metadata may not be the most convenient way to identify which variable you
<br />
want, however. Heinke's proposal has many more examples where the CF metadata,
<br />
as Alison and I see it, does not offer the simplest way to *find* the quantity
<br />
in the dataset, because it requires searching on a combination of metadata.
<br />
<br />Personally I don't think this calls for reengineering CF, because we already
<br />
have a lot of investment (human time and data written) in our current way of
<br />
doing things, which has advantages. Moreover, it doesn't appear to be a
<br />
general problem as there have not been complaints about it up to now. There
<br />
are two other ways to deal with the issue:
<br />
<br />* Make the program cleverer which reads the data. I would guess it is not very
<br />
hard to offer the user a menu of quantities defined as bundles of metadata
<br />
specifications such as tas or Heinke's indices, and then search for these
<br />
combinations. It would also not be difficult to scan a dataset against the
<br />
definitions of the bundles in order to display its contents in these terms.
<br />
<br />* Introduce some other attribute of data variables for well-known bundles of
<br />
metadata, such as the definition of tas. This would be redundant and hence a
<br />
possible pitfall as it might be inconsistent with the other metadata in the
<br />
file. Hence I don't like this idea so much. I think is better to keep these
<br />
definitions of bundles outside the netCDF file.
<br />
<br />Now, on to Heinke's proposal!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;index_per_time_period&quot; names. These are counts of days on which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular meteorological conditions existed.
</em><br />
<br />Alison remarks, &quot;I wonder if we even need to include the word &quot;index&quot; in
<br />
all the names&quot;. I agree. In fact the word &quot;index&quot; obscures what the quantity
<br />
is - a number of days per time period - and as Alison says, the time period
<br />
is indicated by the time bounds.
<br />
<br />The AMetSoc glossary says
<br />
<br />frost day: An observational day on which frost occurs; one of a family of
<br />
climatic indicators (e.g., thunderstorm day, rain day).  The definition is
<br />
somewhat arbitrary, depending upon the accepted criteria for a frost
<br />
observation. Thus, it may be 1) a day on which the minimum air temperature in
<br />
the thermometer shelter falls below 0degC (32degF); 2) a day on which a
<br />
deposit of white frost is observed on the ground; 3) in British usage, a day
<br />
on which the minimum temperature at the level of the ground or on the tops of
<br />
low, close-growing vegetation falls to -0.9degC (30.4degF) or below (also
<br />
called a &quot;day with ground frost&quot;); and perhaps others. The present trend is to
<br />
drop such terms in favor of something less ambiguous, such as &quot;day with
<br />
minimum temperature below 0degC (32degF)&quot;.
<br />
<br />To me, these remarks seem to support the CF approach of providing explicit
<br />
metadata, because &quot;frost day&quot; isn't actually a well-defined quantity. I think
<br />
we should take the last sentence as advice, and introduce standard names of
<br />
number_of_days_with_minimum|maximum_air_temperature_below|above_threshold, and
<br />
specify the threshold with a standard name of air_temperature_threshold, which
<br />
is already in the table, having been previously introduced for a similar
<br />
purpose (see below). We can assume that the first day starts at the minimum
<br />
time-bound i.e. the time-bounds define both the individual days, and the
<br />
number of days, a bit like CF climatological time. The vertical level e.g. 1.5
<br />
m can be given as a scalar coordinate variable of the data variable, as
<br />
usual. These names should also deal with summer days, ice days and tropical
<br />
nights, which I think are even less in commonly agreed usage; Google doesn't
<br />
find them (at least not near the top of its list).
<br />
<br />This approach, and most of the rest of these proposed names, have &quot;days&quot; as a
<br />
defining characteristic. This is natural because a day is of course not an
<br />
arbitrary unit of time, and that's why it also has special treatment in
<br />
climatological time (CF 7.4). However, most of the quantities being proposed
<br />
could also be defined for arbitrary time-intervals e.g. 6 h. It would not be
<br />
sensible to introduce a set of standard names specifying &quot;six_hour_interval&quot;.
<br />
We would need to generalise, I think, and we might then supersede all the
<br />
day-based names we are discussing now.
<br />
<br />Further generality could be achieved if the &quot;minimum&quot; or &quot;maximum&quot; (or &quot;mean&quot;)
<br />
didn't have to appear in the standard name. Usually it is in the cell_methods,
<br />
but in this case the statistical method applies to the coordinate variable
<br />
(the threshold) rather than the data variable (the number of days). We could
<br />
remove it from the standard name if we allowed the cell_methods to have a
<br />
slightly broader interpretation in which it could be involved in describing
<br />
how the quantity was calculated (number of days) from some other quantity (air
<br />
temperature). I think that would be a reasonable thing to do; in fact similar
<br />
suggestions have been made before regarding other statistical quantities such
<br />
as correlation coefficients. If we made that generalisation of cell_methods,
<br />
the standard names to be introduced would be number_of_days_with_air_
<br />
temperature_below|above_threshold.
<br />
<br />The indices with &quot;consecutive days&quot; meeting a condition could be called
<br />
maximum_spell_length_of_days_with_air_temperature_below|above_threshold. Is
<br />
that right? Here, the &quot;maximum&quot; also implies a statistical processing, but
<br />
it is an intrinsic part of the definition of the quantity itself. First you
<br />
have to identify all the spells, then find the longest one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wet_days_index_per_time_period
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; heavy_precipitation_days_index_per_time_period
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very_heavy_precipitation_days_index_per_time_period
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These all essentially describe the same concept, i.e., the number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; days when the daily accumulated precipitation exceeds a threshold.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thresholds defining wet, heavy precipitation and very heavy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precipitation are 1 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm respectively.  Perhaps we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could combine these names and use a scalar coordinate variable to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specify the threshold:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number_of_days_accumulated_precipitation_exceeds_threshold
</em><br />
<br />I agree with that. Consistent with temperature, the standard names would be
<br />
number_of_days_with_precipitation_amount_below|above_threshold, referring to a
<br />
threshold of precipitation_amount in kg m-2. That's numerically the same as
<br />
mm, of course, but if we want mm we should have lwe_thickness_of_
<br />
precipitation_amount instead of precipitation_amount. Although &quot;wet days&quot; and
<br />
&quot;dry days&quot; are commonly used phrases, various thresholds are used in practice
<br />
(at least, that is my recollection from when I used to work on that).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strong_breeze_days_index_per_time_period
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strong_gale_days_index_per_time_period
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hurricane_days_index_per_time_period
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is another case where the three names are essentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describing the same concept, i.e., the number of days when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maximum wind speed exceeds a particular threshold.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. Consistent with temperature and precipitation, I would choose
<br />
number_of_days_with_maximum_wind_speed_above_threshold (almost the same as
<br />
Alison) with a threshold having standard name of wind_speed. As for
<br />
temperature, the &quot;maximum&quot; could be moved from the standard name to the
<br />
cell_methods if we allowed cell_methods a wider interpretation.
<br />
<br />In all these cases, the threshold does not have to be a scalar coordinate
<br />
variable; it could have a dimension exceeding 1 and a multivalued coordinate
<br />
variable, so that one data variable could contain the values for several
<br />
thresholds.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) &quot;index_wrt_Nth_percentile|mean_of_reference_period&quot; names, where N
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a number in the range 1-100 and the reference period is defined in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a variable attribute.  These are counts of days when particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meteorological conditions existed relative to a threshold defined from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reference period.
</em><br />
<br />While working on the IPCC AR4, I found it quite hard to find out what the
<br />
&quot;heat wave index&quot; etc. quantities meant, because it was not stated as
<br />
explicitly as this. In addition, it turns out that there is a variety of
<br />
colloquial phrases, such as &quot;heat wave&quot; and &quot;hot spell&quot;, and this causes
<br />
confusion. Both of these problems indicate to me that clarity is useful. That
<br />
would suggest number_of_days_with_[maximum_]air_temperature_above_percentile_
<br />
and_spell_length_above_threshold, with coordinates of cumulative_probability_
<br />
of_air_temperature to specify the level of the percentile e.g. 0.9 or 90% and
<br />
spell_length_threshold e.g. 6 days. As Alison remarks, the climatology is not
<br />
specified wrt which the percentiles are calculated.
<br />
<br />This name is rather long. We could make a further generalisation to avoid it,
<br />
by using a standard_name of number_of_days alone in all cases and
<br />
distinguishing them solely by their coordinate variables. That is consistent
<br />
with the obvious fact that standard names don't indicate all the independent
<br />
variables e.g. we don't have a standard name of air_temperature_as_a_function_
<br />
of_latitude_and_longitude to indicate that's what it depends on. We expect
<br />
software to examine the coordinate variables to work that out. A more likely
<br />
case is that software has to examine the vertical coordinate to find out if
<br />
it's air_temperature on model levels, pressure levels, height levels or
<br />
whatever. Likewise, you could argue that the quantity of number_of_days is
<br />
always the same, with different independent variables - but that argument is
<br />
not convincing, I don't think.
<br />
<br />A counter-argument is that probability_density_of_air_temperature and
<br />
probability_density_of_precipitation_amount must have different standard names
<br />
because they have different units, of K-1 and (kg m-2)-1. So for consistency
<br />
probability_of_air_temperature and probability_of_precipitation_amount, with
<br />
coordinate bounds specifying the ranges of the independent variables, should
<br />
have different standard names, even though they have the same unit of 1. If
<br />
these have different names, so should number_of_days with different
<br />
independent variables, as number of days is a probability multiplied by a
<br />
length of time.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3) &quot;percent of time wrt_to_Nth_percentile|mean_of_reference_period&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; names, where N is a number in the range 1-100 and the reference period
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is defined in a variable attribute.  These names express the percent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time per time period (specified by time bounds) that conditions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist above or below a threshold calculated from the reference period.
</em><br />
<br />The examples given are not exactly percentage of time, since the
<br />
discretisation into days is an essential element of the definition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another general comment is that I would prefer to use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;fraction&quot; rather than &quot;percent&quot; as it is more consistent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing standard names.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with that, and support Alison's proposal, which I'd modify slightly to
<br />
fraction_of_days_with_(minimum|maximum|mean_)(air_temperature|precipitation_
<br />
amount)_above_threshold, with threshold coordinate variables of air_
<br />
temperature and precipitation_amount. As before, the minimum|maximum|mean
<br />
would not be needed if we could transfer it to cell_methods.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (4) &quot;per cent of amount per time period&quot; names.  These names express
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the percentage of a quantity, e.g., precipitation, that has occurred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during a time period (defined by time bounds) from days when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular meteorological conditions existed.
</em><br />
<br />Again, I essentially agree with Alison's proposal. I would suggest
<br />
fraction_of_precipitation_amount_on_days_with_precipitation_amount_
<br />
above_percentile, where I used &quot;on&quot; because &quot;due to&quot; has a specified meaning
<br />
in the guidelines, and the threshold would have a standard name of cumulative_
<br />
probability_of_precipitation_amount. The repetition of precipitation_amount
<br />
might seem clumsy, but is necessary because you could have a quantity of
<br />
fraction_of_precipitation_amount_from_days_with_air_temperature_above_
<br />
percentile, for example.
<br />
<br />(5) Miscellaneous
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; growing_season_length_index
</em><br />
<br />I would call this growing_season_duration, as I don't think &quot;index&quot; makes it
<br />
clearer, and because existing &quot;length&quot; names are distances, while we have one
<br />
&quot;duration&quot; name, which is also a time. But I wonder whether &quot;growing season&quot;
<br />
is sufficiently well defined. Web definitions are divided between those saying
<br />
it means the duration of favourable conditions, and those saying it means the
<br />
time between the last frost of spring and the first of autumn. Which is
<br />
intended here?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; heating_degree_days_per_time_period
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This could be:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number_of_heating_degree_days
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not have sufficient expertise to comment on the definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heating degree days - is there a single standard for this or do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternative definitions exist?
</em><br />
<br />There appears to be a commonly used definition of 65degF, but even so I would
<br />
advocate the more general approach. Also, degree-days are not the same as
<br />
numbers of days. In fact we have dealt with degree-days previously (that's
<br />
when the temperature threshold was introduced), and according to that earlier
<br />
decision the name is integral_of_air_temperature_deficit_wrt_time, canonical
<br />
units K s, where the deficit is wrt the air_temperature_threshold specified as
<br />
a coordinate. This name suggest an integral over continuous time, rather than
<br />
using daily means. I don't know whether both are in use and whether we should
<br />
be more precise.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; frost_days_where_no_snow_index_per_time_period
</em><br />
Alison has asked for clarification of this one.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intra_period_extreme_temperature_range; K; difference between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absolute extreme temperatures in the observation period.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that perhaps we need to define a new cell_method of &quot;range&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The standard name would then simply be:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; air_temperature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which, of course, is already in the table) with cell_methods =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;time: range&quot;.  Do others agree?
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; highest_one_day_precipitation_amount_per_time_period; kg m-2; highest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one day precipitation is the maximum of one day precipitation amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in a given time period.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; highest_five_day_precipitation_amount_per_time_period; kg m-2;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; highest precipitation amount for five day interval (including the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; calendar day as the last day).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would not include &quot;per_time_period&quot; as the period information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should come from the time bounds.  To describe the maximum of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precipitation over different time intervals we can use cell_methods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the additional information in parenthesis (see CF1.0 7.3).  Hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we would have just one name of:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precipitation_amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (already in the standard name table) which would be specified with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate time bounds and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell_methods = &quot;time: maximum (interval: 1 day)&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell_methods = &quot;time: maximum (interval: 5 days)&quot; as appropriate.
</em><br />
<br />I think Alison is right, and this raises an issue which hasn't come up before.
<br />
It is rather like climatological time, where we have different statistical
<br />
methods for nested periods. Here, we are computing first the sum over 5 days,
<br />
then the maximum of those sums. That is analogous to computing first the mean
<br />
precipitation amount over days in the month, then finding the maximum over
<br />
corresponding months in different years. If we wanted to record the maximum of
<br />
5-day-mean temperatures, I don't think we'd have a way to do it at present,
<br />
because it likewise involves two statistical operations, &quot;time: mean (within
<br />
5-day periods) time: maximum (over 5-day periods)&quot;. We could introduce a
<br />
general method for recording double processing (not necessarily time) e.g.
<br />
&quot;time: mean within intervals time: maximum over intervals&quot;, with interval
<br />
being a new attribute of the time cooordinate variable, and the first interval
<br />
assumed to start at the minimum time-bound.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simple_daily_intensity_index_per_time_period; kg m-2; simple daily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intensity index is the mean of precipitation amount on wet days.  A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wet day is a day with precipitation sum exceeding 1 mm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again I would exclude &quot;per_time_period&quot;.  &quot;Intensity&quot; sounds to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like a precipitation rate rather than an amount.  I think we could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again use:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precipitation_amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with appropriate time bounds and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell_methods = &quot;time: mean (over days with precipitation thickness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1 mm)&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />For this, I'd propose something different, but consistent with other cases
<br />
above viz. a standard name of precipitation_amount_on_days_with_precipitation_
<br />
amount_above_threshold. Although this is not climatological time, it again
<br />
needs a new concept of double time-processing, because it is dealing with a
<br />
discontinuous time-interval. First we find the value for each qualifying day,
<br />
then we average them. That could be recorded as &quot;time: mean over days&quot;, which
<br />
is currently allowed only for climatological time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wind_chill_temperature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Wind_chill&quot; is a commonly used term and I am happy to accept it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For consistency with other temperature names perhaps we should have:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wind_chill_air_temperature
</em><br />
I think we could call it just wind_chill_temperature as proposed, because I
<br />
don't think it could be the apparent temperature of anything except air.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please can someone tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me if it is OK to use the &quot;add_offset&quot; attribute to specify a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conversion between Kelvin and Celsius if that is required?
</em><br />
No, we allow it only for packing, but it is OK to use degC as a udunit; the
<br />
conversion is built in.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
