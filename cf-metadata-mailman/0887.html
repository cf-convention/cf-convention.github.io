Dear John
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you can clarify what happens in the following case: 1) Someone expresses a concern.  2) The moderator (or someone else) responds to the concern.  3) The moderator summarizes the outcome after suitable time.  (Note that the person expressing the original concern has said nothing further.) 4) No one else contributes.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this deemed to be a consensus, or not?  My sense is that unless the originator of the concern in step (1) says &quot;I accept your point of view, carry on&quot;,  the initial concern should be considered an outstanding objection.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm. I think it will generally work better if the moderator tries to keep out
<br />
of it (though I'd find that hard if I were moderator :-). I tend to think that
<br />
if A proposes, B objects, C responds to B's objection (in support of A), and
<br />
then neither A nor B comment further, the proposal should be accepted. By not
<br />
responding, I think B has dropped his objection. If B was interested enough to
<br />
comment, I expect he would make time to say just &quot;No, I am still not happy&quot; if
<br />
nothing more.  If C agrees with B's objection, and A doesn't respond, there is
<br />
an outstanding objection and hence not a consensus.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This question might become clearer if the mechanism and timing of the 'call for a vote' was explicitly described in the procedures -- right now the voting is mentioned only in the summary of closing the track ticket.
</em><br />
<br />I think the vote occurs two weeks after the moderator has summarised the
<br />
discussion, if no-one has said anything subsequently. If the summary says
<br />
there is nearly a consensus (in the judgement of the moderator), and no-one
<br />
has challenged that assessment (by commenting subsequently), the issue is
<br />
decided by a vote, and requires near-unanimity for acceptance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Real files can be very useful for humans to understand precisely the application and implications of the proposed change.
</em><br />
<br />OK. Since you and John Caron agree, I am outvoted. :-) If the change was to
<br />
prohibit something, I suppose the test file would be something that was
<br />
deliberately erroneous under the proposed change. That is useful input to
<br />
test the CF checker. Do you agree?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Third option: Require testing before a conclusion is reached. Provisional libcf and CF checkers are presumably within reason.
</em><br />
<br />I think that is the idea. The decision to go from provisional to final depends
<br />
on the testing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, could you briefly mention (or point to) the rationale for the standard names following a separate process? A quick review of the site didn't uncover this information, thanks.
</em><br />
<br />The white paper might say something. It's basically because (a) there are two
<br />
committees representing the different sort of expertise and (b) the nature of
<br />
the changes are different. Stdname proposals are typically large collections of
<br />
small points to be discussed, conventions often larger conceptual issues. But
<br />
there is overlap, as Alison pointed out in Paris, and some issues might cover
<br />
both areas or pass from one to the other.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
