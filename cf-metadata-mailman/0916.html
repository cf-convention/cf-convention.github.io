<br />
Dear all,
<br />
<br />I have finally had a chance to read the lively discussion of this topic. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I vote in favor of Jonathan's modified proposal, but with 
<br />
consideration given to the following:
<br />
<br />1) The revisions proposed today by Jonathan in response to Steve 
<br />
Hankin's concerns should be included.
<br />
<br />2) Correct the inadvertently repeated phrase &quot;in one in one&quot;.
<br />
<br />3) Producing a netCDF file that includes a proposed change may not be 
<br />
entirely trivial, and I fear it might hold up the process.  Whose 
<br />
responsibility will it be to do this?  Some ideas might be proposed by 
<br />
individuals who have never actually written any code that makes calls to 
<br />
the netCDF library.  I therefore suggest that the moderator could make 
<br />
the summary (3 weeks after proposal, or 2 weeks after no contributions) 
<br />
*before* requiring a netCDF file.  [Certainly this should be allowed if 
<br />
no support has been received or if little interest has been expressed in 
<br />
a proposal.]  I therefore recommend the following wording:
<br />
<br />&quot;After four weeks from the proposal, or two weeks of no contributions,
<br />
whichever is longer, the moderator attempts to move toward a decision on 
<br />
the proposal by summarising the outcome. Since several versions of the 
<br />
proposal might have been discussed, the summary should make clear which 
<br />
one, if any, would be adopted. The moderator will then invite further 
<br />
comment on the proposal, as summarized.  If at this point a test netCDF 
<br />
file does not yet exist, it must be created (unless the summary suggests 
<br />
the proposal should be rejected). Once this has been done and after two 
<br />
weeks of no contributions to the discussion, a decision is reached in 
<br />
one of the following ways:&quot;
<br />
<br />4) I'm not sure why there is a desire to include the clause &quot;although 
<br />
some may be guided by the expertise of others.&quot;  I would drop it.  I 
<br />
would guess that in nearly all decisions the committee members will 
<br />
weigh both the technical arguments made and the regard they have for the 
<br />
individual making the argument in deciding whether to support a 
<br />
proposal.  In this sense we all will be guided to some degree by the 
<br />
expertise of others.  Perhaps the entire sentence could be eliminated 
<br />
(i.e., drop &quot;All members must vote, although some may be guided by the 
<br />
expertise of others.&quot;).
<br />
<br />5)  Perhaps we should also include a mechanism whereby a provisional 
<br />
change could be withdrawn even if it were not technically flawed.  It is 
<br />
possible that upon further reflection or in working with the new CF 
<br />
specification, the testers might realize that there is a much better way 
<br />
of doing it. Wouldn't it be better to replace the provisional change 
<br />
with the superior one? I suggest the following wording:
<br />
<br />&quot;At this point, the change is shown in the CF documents as provisional, 
<br />
but it will not be revoked unless subsequent testing shows it to be 
<br />
flawed.  In rare circumstances, unforeseen objections or problems may be 
<br />
identified that could lead the standards committee to decide by 
<br />
unanimous opinion to revoke the provisional change.&quot;
<br />
<br />6) Do we have any guarantees that those expected to test proposed 
<br />
changes using the CF checker and libcf will have the resources (i.e., 
<br />
time) to do this in a reasonable time frame?
<br />
<br />Hope some of this is useful in finalizing the proposed rules.
<br />
<br />Thanks for all the work,
<br />
Karl

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's a new version of the proposed rules incorporating the results of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion in recent days. Are there any further comments? Unless they say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise, I would assume that Balaji, John Caron, Steve, Russ and Rich will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be able to agree to this version. Tom Gross and Karl have not voted yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best wishes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jonathan
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; New proposals are to be made on trac using the template, including verbatim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes proposed to the text of standard document and the conformance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; document.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A member of the conventions committee, or another suitably qualified person,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; volunteers to moderate the discussion. If no-one volunteers, the chairman of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the committee will ask someone to do it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The discussion takes place on trac.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The moderator periodically summarises discussion on trac, keeps it moving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forward and tries to achieve a consensus. It is expected that everyone with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interest will contribute to the discussion and to achieving a consensus during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this stage. During the discussion, if an objection is raised, answered and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasserted, the moderator will assume the objection has been dropped. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since consensus is the best outcome, it will be helpful if anyone who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expresses an objection explicitly withdraws it on changing their mind or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deciding to accept the majority view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It will be helpful if a test netCDF file is provided as early as possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the discussion. However, several variants of the proposal may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussed, and the proposer may not be able to provide test netCDF files for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all of them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After four weeks from the proposal, or two weeks of no contributions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whichever is longer, the moderator attempts to wind up the discussion by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; summarising the outcome. The summary should make clear which version of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposal would be adopted, if any, since several may have been discussed. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test netCDF file must exist for this version of the proposal at the time the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moderator makes the summary. After a further two weeks of no contributions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the discussion is concluded in one in one of the following ways:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consensus: Accept the proposal if there is no outstanding objection, and at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least three contributors have expressed support for it, including at least two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; members of the conventions committee. If the moderator personally expresses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; support, he or she can be counted among the supporters.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Near consensus: If the conditions for consensus are not met but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moderator's summary is that consensus has nearly been achieved, accept the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposal if all, or all but one, of the conventions committe vote in favour of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it. The moderator will call for votes. All members must vote, although some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be guided by the expertise of others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not near consensus: No change to standard.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The trac ticket is then closed by the moderator stating the outcome.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the change is accepted, the standard document should be updated, the CF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convention version number incremented, and the conformance document updated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The author of the proposal should be added to the list of contributing authors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the CF convention.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At this point, the change is shown in the CF documents as provisional, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will not be revoked unless subsequent testing shows it to be flawed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Provisional status lasts until at least two applications have successfully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpreted the data in the test or some other netCDF file following the new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convention. The Unidata libcf and the NCAS CF checker would be sufficient to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meet this requirement. If other applications are to be used, the conventions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; committee must be satisfied that they are suitable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once the testing is successful, the CF documents should again be updated to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remove the provisional status, and the version number incremented again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the testing is not successful, the change is revoked.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All versions of the standard and conformance document should be kept available
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; online, with their trac tickets and a history of changes.
