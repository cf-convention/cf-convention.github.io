Dear Martin
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do people think that the use of the &quot;_content&quot; syntax should be depricated?
</em><br />
<br />I admit responsibility for the choice of &quot;content&quot; to mean &quot;mass per unit area&quot;
<br />
and &quot;energy_content&quot; for &quot;energy per unit area&quot; in the original set of standard
<br />
names (back in 2001!). I agree, that is a similar case. It is terminology that
<br />
was already in use in some connections e.g. soil moisture content, but it is
<br />
not self-explanatory. Perhaps that was the wrong decision and we should have
<br />
had soil_moisture_mass_per_unit_area etc. instead, although no-one's thought it
<br />
obscure enough to propose changing it, so I assume it's not too bad. We *could*
<br />
change it, using aliases, but there are 117 existing standard names that use
<br />
&quot;content&quot; in that way now, so it's pretty well entrenched.
<br />
<br />As I said before, I think our choice of standard names is some compromise
<br />
between convenient terminology for brevity, and definition to make them more
<br />
self-explanatory. There are other phrases apart from &quot;content&quot; which we use
<br />
with standardised meanings that may need explanation, such as &quot;tendency&quot; to
<br />
mean time-derivative. But whereas &quot;mass per unit area&quot; is more cumbersome
<br />
than &quot;content&quot;, and &quot;derivative with respect to time&quot; is more cumbersome than
<br />
&quot;tendency&quot;, &quot;moles&quot; is not more cumbersome than &quot;mole burden&quot;, so that is a
<br />
difference between these cases.
<br />
<br />Another reservation about &quot;mole burden&quot; that has occurred to me is that it is
<br />
a term that naturally refers to a minor consituent, which is carried out by
<br />
the bulk of the air. But you might wish to refer to the number of moles of
<br />
nitrogen in the atmosphere, or the number of moles of air. I wouldn't find it
<br />
natural to call these a &quot;burden&quot; too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the usage in the IPCC reports are not significant, what kind of evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of previous usage would be considered meaningful?
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that the terminology used in the IPCC reports was generally
<br />
designed to be self-explanatory, unlike CF metadata. In the parts I was
<br />
connected with, we were concerned to be consistent in our terminology, and
<br />
to make sure it was defined correctly in the glossary, but the terminology
<br />
which we used (and standardised within the report as far as possible) was that
<br />
used in the literature being assessed i.e. specialist terminology. I think the
<br />
the issue of self-explanatory terminology is more important for metadata than
<br />
it is in text document, where you have the context to help you understand it,
<br />
and that serves to clarify the terminology in a way that isn't possible for
<br />
standard names.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
