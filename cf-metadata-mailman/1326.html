Dear Craig
<br />
<br />Yes, I've already said that I agree that your list
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;      surface_temperature (already defined)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      sea_water_temperature (for temperatures at depth)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      sea_surface_skin_temperature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      sea_surface_subskin_temperature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      sea_surface_foundation_temperature
</em><br />
<br />is in the end the best solution we can agree on, although it comes full circle,
<br />
as you said.
<br />
<br />I am sorry that I subsequently confused this or it got lost by reusing this
<br />
example in the wider debate on what standard names are for, because it's a
<br />
good example. The discussion is important but does not solve any immediate
<br />
problem, so we should go with what you have proposed.
<br />
<br />I am going to make further comments now, but that doesn't mean I am arguing
<br />
against the above!
<br />
<br />You are quite right that to serve the community better CF should make its
<br />
decisions faster. This is a long-standing problem, which partly comes from the
<br />
fact that despite its growing importance, and the fact that it is used by many
<br />
projects (like yours) to which large resources are committed, CF itself still
<br />
has very little dedicated staff effort. It is a common resource which benefits
<br />
many institutions but is paid for by hardly anyone. (That's an even wider issue
<br />
than standard names in general, so doesn't really belong in this thread!)
<br />
<br />I tried to explain in an earlier posting why I think standard names are partly
<br />
definitions, and why that means they are not just &quot;names&quot;. It is because the
<br />
community the data serves is often broader than the one which produces the
<br />
data. What is understood in a smaller community is often not so clear to a
<br />
larger community. That doesn't imply any disrespect to the authority or the
<br />
expertise of the smaller community. I understand that people may feel indignant
<br />
if they think someone else is claiming to describe their data better than they
<br />
can themselves, but that is not the intention. When I have questioned standard
<br />
name proposals, the question is often, &quot;What does that mean?&quot;, and then I have
<br />
often made suggestions that the standard name adopted should have elements of
<br />
the *answer* to the question, so that other users will not have to ask. They
<br />
can just look at the metadata and know what the data is. As a data analyst, I
<br />
think this is very important. I don't want to have to spend a lot of time
<br />
hunting down definitions and documentation to decide which of the quantities in
<br />
a dataset is the one I want to use. I hope that seems reasonable to you.
<br />
<br />Thank you for persisting with CF.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
