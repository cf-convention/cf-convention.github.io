Dear Ian and Dan
<br />
<br />Thanks for your email. I believe we agree on the following (omitting the
<br />
descriptions for the sake of the overview).
<br />
<br />Rename:
<br />
<br />water_flux_into_ocean
<br />
water_flux_into_ocean_from_rivers
<br />
water_volume_transport_into_ocean_from_rivers
<br />
wind_mixing_energy_flux_into_ocean
<br />
water_flux_into_ocean_without_flux_correction (proposal agreed with Martina)
<br />
<br />by replacing &quot;ocean&quot; with &quot;sea_water&quot;.
<br />
<br />Include Newtonian relaxation in the definitions of water_flux_into_sea_water,
<br />
water_flux_out_of_sea_water (T5), water_flux_out_of_sea_ice_and_sea_water
<br />
(T3), virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water (T6).
<br />
<br />New names:
<br />
<br />T1 water_flux_out_of_sea_water_due_to_sea_ice_thermodynamics (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
T3 water_flux_out_of_sea_ice_and_sea_water (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
T4 minus_one_times_water_flux_into_sea_water_from_rivers (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
T5 water_flux_out_of_sea_water (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
T7 ocean_mixed_layer_thickness_defined_by_vertical_tracer_diffusivity (m)
<br />
T8 heat_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_newtonian_relaxation (W m-2)
<br />
T9 water_flux_out_of_sea_water_due_to_newtonian_relaxation (kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
T12 model_level_number_at_base_of_ocean_mixed_layer_defined_by_sigma_theta (1)
<br />
T13 depth_at_maximum_upward_derivative_of_sea_water_potential_temperature (m)
<br />
T15 ocean_integral_of_sea_water_potential_temperature_wrt_depth_expressed_as_heat_content (J m-2)
<br />
T17 sea_ice_albedo (1)
<br />
U2 bolus_sea_water_x_velocity (m s-1)
<br />
U3 x_derivative_of_ocean_rigid_lid_pressure (N m-3)
<br />
V2 bolus_sea_water_y_velocity (m s-1)
<br />
V3 y_derivative_of_ocean_rigid_lid_pressure (N m-3)
<br />
W2 vertical_sea_water_temperature_diffusivity (m2 s-1)
<br />
W4 vertical_sea_water_momentum_diffusivity (m2 s-1)
<br />
W5 vertical_sea_water_momentum_diffusivity_due_to_convection (m2 s-1)
<br />
W6 vertical_sea_water_salinity_diffusivity (m2 s-1)
<br />
G4 angle_of_rotation_from_east_to_x (degree)
<br />
G5 angle_of_rotation_from_east_to_y (degree)
<br />
G6 cell_area (m2)
<br />
G7 model_level_number_at_sea_floor (1)
<br />
<br />Others are either agreed to be equivalent to existing names, or discussed
<br />
below (T6, T10, T11, W3, W7, G1-3).
<br />
<br />T3: This quantity includes rivers, flux adjustment and relaxation. Without
<br />
these i.e. only the fluxes at the surface of the sea ice and sea water, the
<br />
name would be surface_upward_water_flux, since &quot;surface&quot; means &quot;bottom of
<br />
atmosphere&quot; in effect. We also agreed that T2 is surface_upward_water_flux,
<br />
over the open ocean i.e. it is P-E where there is no sea-ice. These would be
<br />
distinguished by cell_methods. T2 is &quot;where ice_free_sea&quot;, but if sea-ice is
<br />
included there is no need for &quot;where&quot; because it applies to the whole
<br />
gridbox. You can also have &quot;where sea_ice&quot;, which would mean the
<br />
precipitation, evaporation and sublimation from the sea-ice surface.
<br />
<br />T4: I agree with you that, though inelegant, this is preferable to using
<br />
the scale_factor. That's intended for packing, not for defining the sign of
<br />
the quantity.
<br />
<br />T6: In your email you explain this as just being -T5*SSS (I think I am right
<br />
to put in minus, since T5 is upward, and your original proposal for T6 is
<br />
downward).  This is related to the salinity flux, which is
<br />
-T5*SSS/density. That being so, your word &quot;virtual&quot;, which has the virtue of
<br />
being often used, may be best to indicate it's not really a physical salt
<br />
flux. So for consistency with T5 I would now propose
<br />
virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water (kg m-2 s-1).
<br />
<br />T8, T9. I agree with your insertion of &quot;newtonian&quot;.
<br />
<br />T10. Following T6, I would now suggest
<br />
virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_newtonian_relaxation (kg m-2 s-1).
<br />
<br />T11. Things should have the same standard name if they are intended to be
<br />
compared. They need different standard names if you want to distinguish them.
<br />
So the choice depends on the application, to some extent. I think that
<br />
sea_surface_height_above_geoid is OK for the quantity derived from the rigid
<br />
lid, as used in CMIP3, but if you want to show where it comes from, my
<br />
modified suggestion of yours would be
<br />
ocean_rigid_lid_pressure_expressed_as_sea_surface_height_above_geoid. We don't
<br />
currently have a standard name of ocean_rigid_lid_pressure but it might
<br />
plausibly be proposed. We have other uses of &quot;expressed as&quot;. What would you
<br />
prefer?
<br />
<br />T13. We haven't put &quot;depth&quot; in other &quot;ocean depth&quot; names so I've omitted
<br />
it from your proposal.
<br />
<br />T14. We have a standard name of plain &quot;depth&quot; meaning distance below the
<br />
surface, which is what you want, I think. It's fine to give it a coordinate of
<br />
sea_water_potential_temperature. If there is another quantity with that
<br />
standard name, they just have to have different variable names. Good solution!
<br />
There is a symmetry about having both sea_water_potential_temperature with a
<br />
coordinate of depth, and vice-versa.  My only reservation is that the standard
<br />
name of the data variable doesn't indicate it's in the ocean, but I think
<br />
that's OK. The coord variable implies this, and anyway &quot;depth&quot; is really
<br />
independent of medium.
<br />
<br />T15. &quot;ocean&quot; seems a bit unnecessary and it's only there to indicate the
<br />
integral is through the whole depth of the ocean, as contrasted with a layer.
<br />
We make this distinction in many standard names, however, and I'd like to get
<br />
rid of it, but that should be a separate proposal.
<br />
<br />U3. A slight simplification of your latest version; I hope that's OK. N m-3
<br />
and Pa m-1 are both fine, being equivalent!
<br />
<br />W3. Is this also temperature rather than tracer?
<br />
<br />W4. You are right, we have not made this distinction; we have not used the
<br />
word &quot;viscosity&quot; at all so far because of the potential ambiguity.
<br />
<br />W7. As alternative to introducing the term &quot;lateral&quot; we could perhaps call
<br />
this xy, to mean the coordinate plane. In other contexts we use the word
<br />
&quot;horizontal&quot; to mean this (as it usually is) but a vertical component of
<br />
something horizontal would certainly be a mysterious concept! Why do you
<br />
prefer &quot;part&quot; to &quot;component&quot;? I think
<br />
vertical_component_of_sea_water_tracer_xy_diffusivity would be intelligible.
<br />
<br />G1-G3. I like your suggestion of &quot;coordinate index&quot;. That gives us
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;magnitude_of_derivative_of_distance_wrt_x_coordinate_index (m)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;magnitude_of_derivative_of_distance_wrt_y_coordinate_index (m)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;magnitude_of_derivative_of_distance_wrt_model_level_number (m)
<br />
but I wonder whether we might be better off with x_distance, y_distance
<br />
and depth? Although this is repetition, &quot;distance&quot; is rather a vague word
<br />
and that might clarify the picture. Since they are magnitudes it doesn't
<br />
matter whether it is depth or height, and depth seems more intuitive for
<br />
an ocean model. What do you think?
<br />
<br />G4. The sign convention anticlockwise=positive should be stated in the
<br />
definition, as you say.
<br />
<br />G6. I did prefer &quot;area&quot; earlier but you have changed my mind.
<br />
<br />G7. Yes, you are right in thinking that the proposed change of the CF
<br />
cell_measures attribute, as described in our original email would need a trac
<br />
ticket raised, with a sponsor etc? This applies likewise to G1-G3, which
<br />
could also be cell_measures.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
