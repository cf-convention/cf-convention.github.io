Dear Karl et al.
<br />
<br />Standard names are certainly a difficult business and it's a good idea to
<br />
discuss how we should be dealing with them. They are much more than names, as
<br />
Julia Collins remarked.
<br />
<br />In your email, Karl, I am unclear whether you are proposing to replace the
<br />
single standard_name attribute with many attributes, or to construct the
<br />
single attribute by a more systematic procedure. I think there are several
<br />
arguments in favour of having a single attribute:
<br />
<br />* There are several possible optional qualifying bits of information
<br />
(at_SURFACE, due_to_PROCESS, assuming_CONDITION, etc.). With a single
<br />
attribute, you know at once what is specified. With separate attributes, you
<br />
would need a separate way to find out what attributes might possibly be
<br />
specified, in order to check whether they were there.
<br />
<br />* It makes sure that essential definitive information is included, such as the
<br />
sign-convention. Separate attributes can be accidentally omitted.
<br />
<br />* It is more convenient in a program to examine a single attribute to find
<br />
what you want. If the information is in several attributes, you need to have
<br />
several if-conditions ANDed together. (Of course, sometimes this is necessary
<br />
anyway if there is a condition on coordinates or cell_methods too, but we
<br />
don't want to make things unnecessarily difficult.)
<br />
<br />* The order of the bits of information may be significant e.g. the two
<br />
components of a tensor, or the order of transformations. If they are in
<br />
separate attributes, the ordering would be more awkward to record.
<br />
<br />In favour of many attributes, you suggest that you might want to contain the
<br />
data for quantities which currently have various standard names in a single
<br />
data array e.g. concentrations of different chemical species, contributions of
<br />
various processes. This might be desirable, but I'm not convinced. This is
<br />
being discussed in the chemistry thread, where it has been remarked that
<br />
although chemical models *do* have dimensions over chemical species, it is not
<br />
essential to write out the data in that way. But it could be done, by making
<br />
the chemical species a coordinate dimension, as we have been discussing. It
<br />
could be done in general by making the standard_name a coordinate variable,
<br />
instead of an attribute, if there is a strong reason for doing it.
<br />
<br />Of course, I am not arguing entirely against having more than one attribute.
<br />
We do have cell_methods and standard_name qualifiers as well as basic standard
<br />
names and coordinates, for instance. I think there's a good reason to separate
<br />
out qualifiers which are always or usually relevant.
<br />
<br />Supposing we continue with a single attribute, the issue is whether we can
<br />
construct it with less effort. You say yourself that this is perhaps the more
<br />
important objective. I agree that if we had a system for assembling new
<br />
standard names from existing components, it would be useful. It would help
<br />
people find out whether there was in fact already a name for something, and it
<br />
would make sure we put things in the same order and used the same phrases
<br />
wherever relevant. I believe there is actually more system to the existing
<br />
names than the Guidelines indicate, and an automatic system would make this
<br />
apparent.
<br />
<br />However, the cases which are extensions of existing patterns are already the
<br />
easy ones. They are not the cases which take most of the time and effort to
<br />
deal with, I think. I've said this before - do you think I'm mistaken in this
<br />
perception? Consider recent examples:
<br />
<br />* The long debate about extreme statistics was mostly about how the metadata
<br />
should be organised among standard name, coordinate variable and cell methods,
<br />
not about the choice of standard name per se.
<br />
<br />* The thread about &quot;date and time&quot; is so far more about what we want to
<br />
distinguish than how to do it.
<br />
<br />* I listed in another thread some questions that Stephen Griffies and I have
<br />
been discussing for ocean quantities for CMIP5. These are the kind of
<br />
decisions that took most time, not actually stringing together a name:
<br />
- Basin masks for tracer and velocity are the same geophysical quantity, but
<br />
distinguished by coordinates.
<br />
- What does &quot;ideal age&quot; of sea water mean?
<br />
- Is the mixed-layer depth determined by a buoyancy criterion the same concept
<br />
as mixed-layer depth determined by sigma-theta?
<br />
- Transports across various straits are all the same geophysical quantity, and
<br />
the strait should be identified by some string-valued coordinate.
<br />
- How do we most usefully categorise the various kinds of ocean mixing in a
<br />
way which will be helpful for comparing models?
<br />
- What is the clearest way to describe the energetics of vertical mixing: is
<br />
it the rate of work against stratification, or the rate of change of potential
<br />
energy?
<br />
<br />While a better description of what we are doing would clarify the existence of
<br />
difficult cases and help us think about them, I don't think would reduce the
<br />
hard work of deciding on the new distinctions, elements and constructions.
<br />
<br />However, I think it would still be valuable to follow this up. Because of the
<br />
issue of ordering, and the large number of qualifiers, I think Robert
<br />
Muetzelfeldt's description of the problem by using a grammar is more
<br />
appropriate than using a number of independent attributes.
<br />
<br />Finally, I wonder whether you could say more about what you mean by &quot;this
<br />
standard_name business seems a bit out of control&quot;?
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
