<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concisely as possible
</em><br />
<br />Well, each bullet is concise, anyway.  CF is a lot of things.
<br />
<br />If you just want to see what the recommended priorities are, skip to  
<br />
sections 5 and 6.
<br />
<br />1. CF standard names are:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A- a reasonably concise mediation between user needs for meaningful  
<br />
terms, and interoperability requirements for consistent terms
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B- a steadily growing and improving repository of concepts and  
<br />
categories from the environmental science community
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;C- a mechanism for deriving consistent understanding of scientific  
<br />
concepts (which then is captured in the names, often)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;D- increasingly a mechanism to reach understanding of engineering  
<br />
and operation concepts
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;E- the only reasonably decent controlled list of parameter names  
<br />
(community-run using open, visible processes, well-managed  
<br />
technically,  thoughtfully administered, and moderately wide and deep  
<br />
in their coverage)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;F- inclusive of a large number of categories that can be used to  
<br />
classify the concepts
<br />
<br />2. CF standard name creation processes are:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A- wonderfully well-thought-out, meaning they work pretty well to  
<br />
achieve the complex goals they target
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B- effectively open, transparent, and accessible, even to new  
<br />
participants (except for learning curve)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;C- executed with the necessary attention to detail
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;D- reasonably well documented
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;E- as short as they can be given the goals and community scale
<br />
<br />The following are observations, not criticisms; in many cases these  
<br />
are good or necessary things. (In other cases they are not fixable  
<br />
even if that is desirable.)
<br />
<br />3. CF standard names are not (starred items are recommended in section  
<br />
5):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A- semantically perfect in their construction (different words can  
<br />
mean the same thing)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B - syntactically perfect in their construction (one can't always  
<br />
parse meaning out of the name's construction)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;C- representative of everything you might want to know about a  
<br />
parameter
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;D* covering a particularly large percentage of the needed concepts
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;E* covering a significant percentage of the possible concepts
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;F- modularized into all the possible components necessary to  
<br />
distinguish one term from another
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;G* particularly graceful at dealing with engineering terms
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;H* independent of the content/metadata specification which they target
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I* crystal clear about the relationship between the standard names  
<br />
and other elements of the CF specification
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;J* free of bias (in coverage, and sometimes in meaning) due to their  
<br />
communities of origin
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;K* resolvable via URIs (except possibly through the BODC vocab  
<br />
server?)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;L* accessible as ontology terms (e.g, for mapping by other systems)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;M* described by an ontology (to establish the relationship among the  
<br />
standard names)
<br />
<br />4. CF standard name creation processes are not (starred items are  
<br />
recomended in section 6):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A* particularly fast (at the community stage)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B* particularly easy (to understand the system and come up with the  
<br />
name in the first place)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;C* able to handle the large number of standard names we could inject  
<br />
into the system manually
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;D* anywhere near able to handle the larger number of standard names  
<br />
that could be generated automatically or systematically
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;E* crystal clear about what kinds of things are, and are not,  
<br />
welcome or useful as standard names
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;F- an attempt to develop a comprehensive system for naming concepts
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;G- until now, addressing the priorities of items in III and IV --  
<br />
good show!
<br />
<br />The priorities for CF are very much a matter of choosing which things  
<br />
CF wants to be.  The answers below represent my ideal scenario for CF,  
<br />
given what I think the oceanographic community needs and where CF is  
<br />
now. Most important priorities come first in each list.  If I don't  
<br />
list something from lists 3 and 4, that means it isn't a significant  
<br />
problem in my mind.
<br />
<br />5. CF standard names should be addressing/focusing on solutions to:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A-  3K and 3L (URIs, ontology terms) -- this is happening by  
<br />
necessity via other services, but CF needs to buy in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B-  3D and 3E (increased coverage) -- make it possible to cover more  
<br />
terms more easily (like 3G, engineering terms, if CF wants to)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;C-  3J (decreasing bias) -- but this is already happening
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;D-  3H and 3I (decouple names from spec) -- make CF standard names  
<br />
usable in all content standards, not just CF (possible?)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;E-  3M (relate terms in ontology) -- this is a nicety for the  
<br />
semantic web, but not critical in the short term for CF users
<br />
<br />6. CF standard name processes should be addressing/focusing on  
<br />
solutions to:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A-  4B and 4E (easier, clearer for users) -- make the user  
<br />
experience a welcoming one
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B-  4C, if not also 4D; implies 4A also (faster) -- somehow find a  
<br />
way to accept more names more quickly with less effort
