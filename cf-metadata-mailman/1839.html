Dear John and Karl,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your comments about the changes.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a few suggestions for the area_type info. Well, more like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An area_type that I imagine being useful within a year or two, if not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within months, is the benthic floor (i.e., land under the sea).  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by analog: land under a lake, or the more general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water_covered_ground. I'm not recommending those changes now, but they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; raise the following question:  Is 'land' is intended to be all-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encompassing in this regard?  Definitions would help make this clear.
</em><br />
<br />My own understanding of 'land' is that it means dry land, i.e. not
<br />
covered by seas.  I think essentially it corresponds to those areas that
<br />
would be flagged as land in the land-sea mask of a climate model.  I
<br />
have wondered myself if this definition of 'land' actually includes
<br />
lakes and rivers.  I'd welcome any suggestions as to what the precise
<br />
definition should be.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a general observation, discussing terms without associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitions can lead to confusion on all parts.
</em><br />
<br />I couldn't agree more!  It is often only when I come to write the
<br />
definitions of standard names that I realise just how woolly is my own
<br />
understanding of some of the concepts involved.  I would very much like
<br />
to move to a situation where all area_type strings and all
<br />
standard_names have help text associated.  The reasons that very few
<br />
area_types have descriptions at the moment are: (a) none were discussed
<br />
under ticket 17; (b) I didn't want to simply invent descriptions without
<br />
having the opportunity to discuss them first; (c) we wanted to make a
<br />
first draft of the area_type table available quickly because the list is
<br />
already starting to grow and people need to get at the information.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how all_standard_names makes sense as an area_type.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I think this is a typo and the string should in fact read
<br />
all_area_types.  Thanks for pointing this out and I'm sure Velimir will
<br />
correct it shortly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If lake_ice_or_sea_ice excludes icebergs, does sea_ice?  This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterintuitive to a lay person, admittedly not the target audience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Also note, this is where the relation between terms is useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information to have -- somewhere in my assumed hierarchy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    floating_ice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      lake_ice_or_sea_ice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        sea_ice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a discrepancy, perhaps intentional. Suggest the discontinuity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be made explicit in the definition (i..e, explain why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lake_ice_or_sea_ice excludes icebergs, while floating_ice does not;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and address whether sea_ice includes icebergs.  The definition is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where people will look to understand the relationships.
</em><br />
<br />Again, I agree completely with your general point.  I think we do need
<br />
to be clear about the definitions, or to be able to say when and why we
<br />
are being deliberately vague.  Quite a number of the standard name
<br />
descriptions contain information about relationships and I can see no
<br />
reason not to do the same with area_types. As to whether sea_ice
<br />
includes icebergs, I suspect the answer is no (because climate model
<br />
sea-ice masks don't include icebergs) but my answer could well be wrong!
<br />
I hope that Jonathan may be able to help out with the ice area_types as
<br />
it is more his field of expertise than mine.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I assume the absence of lake_ice is deliberate. (Just a thought:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sometimes completeness is helpful for clarity, especially when there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are no definitions, even though there may not be any immediate use for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the term. Otherwise it makes some of us wonder why something *wasn't*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; included.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />A lake_ice area type hasn't been included at the moment because nobody
<br />
has asked for it.  The underlying philosophy for adding standard names
<br />
is that we don't add them unless there is a specific proposal, even if
<br />
that means that some obvious 'sets' of standard names are incomplete.
<br />
In the first instance I have adopted a similar philosophy for
<br />
area_types.  As you know, there is a lot of discussion at the moment
<br />
about the general direction standard names should take in the future and
<br />
I suggest that would be a suitable place for further debate of this
<br />
particular point.  I would note, however, that the current position is
<br />
consistent with the overall CF development philosophy of not trying to
<br />
anticipate all possible future needs.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison
