Dear John
<br />
<br />Thanks for your helpful email and summary.
<br />
<br />(a) Regarding
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; After a suitable opportunity for general comment  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the latest emails, can the moderators weigh in with suggestions to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolve each issue one way or the other, or to create a TRAC proposal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion?
</em><br />
<br />I would like to point out that there are no moderators available. Those who
<br />
are discussing it are responsible. CF doesn't have any other resources to
<br />
resolve such issues. We can move to trac if you like. If there are specific
<br />
proposals to amend the convention, trac is the way to make them.
<br />
<br />(b) Unprocessed/uncalibrated geophysical properties. I think this is my
<br />
raw data. We could propose a standard name modifier for it. Since that has
<br />
to specify a particular units transformation, I think the obvious options are
<br />
dimensionless raw data (units not specified), or raw data with the same
<br />
physical dimensions as the geophysical quantity. If both are useful, separate
<br />
modifiers for each of them could be proposed. Nan also mentioned QC data;
<br />
that is certainly a good purpose for standard_name modifiers and we already
<br />
have some defined in the convention for that. Both you and Roy think that
<br />
the modifier would be better if it was attached with some non-blank character
<br />
to the rest of the standard name. That could be proposed as a change to the
<br />
convention (although we'd have to keep blank-separation for backward
<br />
compatibility). I would argue that if we do that it should be some character
<br />
which we would prohibit from being used anywhere else in a standard name.
<br />
For instance, we could use % for this purpose. I think hyphen would be
<br />
confusing as it looks too much like underscore.
<br />
<br />(c) Sensor quantities. I don't think we should completely rule out defining
<br />
standard names for these. For example, I think the &quot;platform&quot; names in the
<br />
standard name table are well-defined and useful. However, I quite like your
<br />
idea of defining generic standard names. If they are going to be standard
<br />
names, they have to have canonical units, so they cannot be as vague as &quot;sensor
<br />
property&quot;. However, we could define a standard name for sensor_temperature,
<br />
for instance. That would replace temperature_of_sensor_for_oxygen_in_sea_water,
<br />
in your suggestion, I think. The more specific description would no longer be
<br />
in the standard name. However, to some extent this just postpones the issue.
<br />
Is it necessary to *standardise* the extra information, or could each dataset
<br />
just record it in some informal way, for instance in the long_name? If that
<br />
would be sufficient, it would be far easier. Deciding standards is a time-
<br />
consuming business, as we all know.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
