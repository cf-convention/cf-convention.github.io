Hello Jonathan/Nan,
<br />
<br />In the case of pH I am still convinced that the quantities are different.  If we take an example of nitrate concentration in sea water.  We would have no compunction about setting up separate Standard Names for nitrate in moles/litre and nitrate in moles/kg.  Why is this different from [H+] in moles/litre and moles/kg that just happens to by convention to have a log transform applied? Similar arguments can be developed for the other pH scales: they are effectively summed concentrations of different inseperable species combinations. If a request came in for nitrate+nitrite concentration (nitrate is usually reduced to nitrite for colorometric assay and nitrite correction isn't always possible) wouldn't we give that a different Standard Name?
<br />
<br />To answer Nan's point, I know that creating definitions isn't easy, but they provide a much better vehicle for presenting complex information than structured text that ideally has limited length.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />
<br />Dear Nan and Roy
<br />
<br />I think it is a bit arbitrary whether one regards them as different quantities
<br />
or different methods of measurement, but now I am tending in the direction of
<br />
the latter because of what John last said about it. It is actually somewhere
<br />
between, because the answers are known to be systematically different with the
<br />
different methods. However, it turns out not to be possible to describe in a
<br />
phrase (even a long phrase) what the difference is. That is, if asked the
<br />
question in a seminar, the expert would say, &quot;The quantities differ because of
<br />
various details in the way they are measured.&quot; If the difference is so
<br />
detailed and hard to summarise, it seems to me that it really is a matter of
<br />
technique, and not of different geophysical quantities. I would expect it to be
<br />
possible to say, in a phrase, what the *essence* is of the difference between
<br />
geophysical quantities, whereas that cannot necessarily be done for methods.
<br />
Consequently, I would say that if we introduce a new attribute to identify
<br />
methods of measurement, we would not expect it to be as self-explanatory as
<br />
standard names. Whereas it is reasonable to expect an average scientist to
<br />
understand what is meant by a standard name, it is not necessary or reasonable
<br />
for different measurement/calculation methods. They depend on domain expertise.
<br />
Does that sound sensible to you?
<br />
<br />A new attribute would also be able to distinguish between cloud fraction from
<br />
cloudsat, calipso or isccp, which is the other example we've had. We've agreed
<br />
these intend to be the same geophysical quantity, but it is known or expected
<br />
that the retrievals from different instruments will not give exactly the same
<br />
answers. However, it is not possible to summarise simply what these differences
<br />
are or to give them a geophysical explanation. So this is again a matter of
<br />
methods of measurement, like pH scales, it seems to me.
<br />
<br />A further purpose for this attribute, if we designed it generally enough, could
<br />
be to identify the raw quantities which we have discussed in another thread.
<br />
The standard name for something could be a measured voltage, for instance,
<br />
and the other attribute says what function this quantity has in a sensor. That
<br />
definitely refers to methods of measurement.
<br />
<br />Regarding Nan's question, I think pH by all the definitions is a dimensionless
<br />
quantity. It is a logarithm, so it must be dimensionless. However, that
<br />
does imply that the quantity whose logarithm is being taken must be in certain
<br />
units, to get the right answer, numerically. That has to be recorded in the
<br />
definition of the quantity. I agree, that is awkward. There is some precedent
<br />
for this. For instance, we have some standard names which specify units of
<br />
decibels. These quantities are logarithms too, and involve a reference level,
<br />
with specified units, in their definition.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
