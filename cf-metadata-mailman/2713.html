Dear Benno
<br />
<br />I think our arguments are all reasonable and clearly stated. The conclusion
<br />
is not clear. Other points of view would be useful.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Fourier transform is a change of basis, not physical variable -- it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is invertible as a matter of fact, as long as you keep the real and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imaginary parts.   Because it is a change of basis, it is much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analagous to a projection transformation than a transformation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical variable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a change of units, you are right, but that is misleading if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it leads you to think that more than a change of basis has occured.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think it's misleading. This is a consistent rule in CF standard
<br />
names: quantities with different canonical units must have different standard
<br />
names. Actually that's not because the units are somehow of magical
<br />
significance, but different units do imply some significant difference in
<br />
definition. A quantity and its Fourier transform are clearly not comparable
<br />
in the sense that you could, for instance, try to calculate their difference.
<br />
If the standard name is the same there is no distinction in CF metadata
<br />
between them except inspection of their coordinate dimensions, which is not
<br />
where a generic application would expect to look. It might search a file for
<br />
a variable of air_pressure and find a Fourier transform of air pressure by
<br />
looking at the standard names, and that's not what it would want.
<br />
<br />I take your point that this is the same kind of situation as a change of
<br />
spatial grid of a given quantity e.g. by interpolation, where the only
<br />
distinction is that the spatial coordinate variables have changed. Still I
<br />
think that is a smaller change than a Fourier transform. After a grid-mapping
<br />
operation, you do still have horizontal spatial coordinate variables. After
<br />
a Fourier transform, one of the spatiotemporal coordinate variables has
<br />
disappeared altogether and been replaced with a different coordinate. I would
<br />
guess that the average scientific user of the data would be more likely to
<br />
regard air_pressure on two different horizontal grids as the &quot;same geophysical
<br />
quantity&quot;, but air_pressure and its Fourier transform wrt time as &quot;different
<br />
geophysical quantities&quot;. That may sound arbitrary and hence the change of
<br />
units is a useful practical guide to deciding.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Software that manipulates complex numbers, (including FFT), needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both the real and imaginary parts -- putting them in separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables is a highly artificial reconstruction of the data which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be undone in order to proceed with any manipulation that treats it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as complex numbers.  Also, the software needs to detect the components
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the complex numbers -- you are making it much more difficult.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of metadata is to make the necessary information available
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly and unambiguously -- having a dimension clearly labelled as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding to real and imaginary is much closer to the information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed to write software to correctly handle complex data.
</em><br />
<br />Again, I understand that point. It could be a bit less convenient, but surely
<br />
it's not *that* bad, is it? It's no harder to look for two different standard
<br />
names than two different values of a coordinate variable. The labelling of real
<br />
and imaginary in the standard name would be just as clear and unambiguous as
<br />
putting it in a coordinate variable - possibly more obvious, in fact. 
<br />
<br />My argument for doing it this way is that it's simpler i.e. it just needs the
<br />
standard name, no more machinery, and because it's what we do in other cases
<br />
where there are a small number of components - usually two (xy) or three (xyz).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3)  CF should handle spectral harmonics as well.
</em><br />
Yes, when it is requested to do so. I'd probably agree with you that in that
<br />
case we would have a coordinate dimension, because it would be multivalued and
<br />
the number and identity of the components would depend on the spectral
<br />
resolution.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
