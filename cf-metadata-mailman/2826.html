HI Alison and Karl,
<br />
<br />I am happy with points 1), 2), 6), 7) and 10)
<br />
<br />The two outstanding ones are the Sea ice thermal energy and bare sea ice albedo, both of which are flagged for action in the CMIP5 document.  
<br />
If we can switch the thermal_energy_content_of_snow back on for both land and sea ice surfaces that would resolve one of the points raised and as I said it was there for land surface under a different name in an earlier version of the CMIP5 document. 
<br />
<br /><br />For point 9, I think the best compromise is to have one sea ice albedo only, which would capture  the snow covered period, spring melt conditions and bare summer conditions as well.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Siobhan

<br />
<br />Dear Jonathan and Siobhan,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your responses. Please see below for an update on the
<br />
status of the discussions.
<br />
<br />1) We are agreed on surface_downward_heat_flux_in_snow (Wm-2). The CMIP5
<br />
output will use
<br />
a cell_methods of &quot;area: mean where land&quot;.
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for inclusion in the standard name table.
<br />

as

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that (a) is surface_temperature for area: where
</em><br />
sea_ice, and (b) is
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea_ice_surface_temperature for area: where snow_on_sea_ice, in  which
</em><br />
I have invented a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new area_type. Both are time: mean.

<br />Siobhan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think Jonathan's sub categories where snow_on_sea_ice and
</em><br />
snow_free_sea_ice approach
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; helps here, we definitely want the surface temperature over the ice
</em><br />
portion of the grid
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell rather than over the whole grid cell (using cell methods). Also
</em><br />
the interface
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temperature between snow and ice is important to account for, as it is
</em><br />
much warmer than
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the surface temperature due to the thermal insulation on snow so I am
</em><br />
no two worried about
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case when there is no snow cover but again the snow_on_sea ice
</em><br />
(area type) would help to prevent the confusion.
<br />
<br />Jonathan's approach simplifies these quantities and I'm happy to follow
<br />
his suggestion.  I think, then, that we are agreed on using the existing
<br />
standard name of surface_temperature for the first quantity and
<br />
introducing a new standard name of
<br />
sea_ice_surface_temperature; K
<br />
for the second.
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for inclusion in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />A new type of snow_on_sea_ice will be added to the area_type table.
<br />
<br />I will check that the CMIP5 output document contains the correct
<br />
cell_methods entries for these quantities.
<br />
<br />(Items 3, 4 and 5 are closed).

the impact differently on the

portion of the cell.  Some

or contribute to melt ponds in

that sophisticated  to allow for

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that effect.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, Siobhan, I'm not 100 per cent clear whether you are happy to go
<br />
with the names I suggested. The names will certainly allow you to
<br />
separate snow and rainfall as per your requirements.
<br />
<br />7) We are agreed on
<br />
tendency_of_sea_ice_amount_due_to_lateral_growth_of_ice_floes; kg m-2
<br />
s-1.
<br />
<br />This name is accepted for inclusion in the standard name table.

<br />8) Sea ice thermal energy

<br />Jonathan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sea_ice_thermal_energy; J
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it really J, not J m-2? If J m-2, the phrase heat_content would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better, as it would be consistent with the existing name

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;integral_of_sea_water_potential_temperature_wrt_depth_expressed_as_heat
</em><br />
_content
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (J m-2). If really J, I wonder if we can think of a phrase related to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heat_content. I am assuming that this quantity relates to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temperature, but maybe it relates to latent heat content? It would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good to be clear about this in the name.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Alison wrote: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to the CMIP5 document, the unit is J and the long name is

'Sea

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ice Total Heat Content'. The explanation says, 'Ice at 0 Celsius is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumed taken to have a heat content of 0 J.  When averaging over
</em><br />
time,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this quantity is weighted by the mass of sea ice.   Report as
</em><br />
&quot;missing&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in regions free of snow on land.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find this rather confusing - if it is supposed to be a sea ice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantity, then surely it should always be reported as &quot;missing&quot; over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; land and open sea.  It doesn't sound as though latent heat is
</em><br />
included.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think we can call it a 'content' because it isn't a quantity
</em><br />
per
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unit area. Perhaps Siobhan can help to clarify this quantity further.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sea ice thermal energy, I am a bit confused on the history on this one

there were two

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requests originally made in my 2008 document sent To Karl and
</em><br />
circulated through the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cryosphere community.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first was

all
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the land surface component. It was in an earlier version of Karl's
</em><br />
document (I had
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saved 16/6/2009) but is not in the latest 17/9/2010.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The sea ice heat content was given as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integral_of_sea_ice_temperature_wrt_depth_expressed_as_heat_content
</em><br />
hcice	New	Jm-2	Month	   1	All
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It looks like they retained the hcice name but changed the units. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I am puzzled as well, I think it should be Jm-2. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The issue of whether the heat content of the snow over the ice should
</em><br />
be included is highlighted, it is possible,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it would be preferable as separate variable, as the thermal
</em><br />
properties are very different form the ice, and it
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could confuse interpretation of result if they were merged into one
</em><br />
effect (Unless you are using the UM, Jonathan
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the atmosphere model treats the two media as if they are
</em><br />
combined).
<br />
<br />We already have the standard name thermal_energy_content_of_surface_snow
<br />
(J m-2) which, if supplied with the correct cell_methods, would deal
<br />
with the first quantity Siobhan mentions.  However, I agree that it
<br />
doesn't seem to be listed as a separate output in the 17/9/2010 CMIP5
<br />
document. If it is needed for CMIP5, then Karl would be the person to
<br />
contact.
<br />
<br />We seem to be in general agreement that the units of the sea_ice thermal
<br />
content should be J m-2, so I will feed that information back to Karl. A
<br />
quantity per unit area can certainly be called a 'content' in standard
<br />
names, so in fact the original suggestion of 
<br />
integral_of_sea_ice_temperature_wrt_depth_expressed_as_heat_content; J
<br />
m-2
<br />
would be appropriate and it would fit with Jonathan's comments.  Is this
<br />
OK?
<br />
<br />9) Sea ice albedo
<br />
<br />Siobhan wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was bothered that the bare sea ice albedo has been flagged for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; removal, It probably should be total sea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ice albedo, though in NCAR model bare ice albedo is changeable due to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; black carbon and multi-scattering in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal layers.  There is a comment on the next page about getting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; albedo from the downwelling and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; upwelling shortwave radiation, but this would not allow for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; penetration of shortwave radiation into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ice.  My preference is for total sea ice albedo to be saved. This will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allows for the more sophisticate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schemes to have an areal average of seasonal changes in albedos across
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thickness categories, snow cover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties, melt ponds and now aerosols effects to be analyzed, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couldn't find surface albedo being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saved elsewhere in the CMIP5  document.
</em><br />
<br />Alison wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In view of Siobhan's comments I think there is definitely a need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree a name for this quantity.  I think that Karl is correct that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'surface_albedo' would normally refer to the whole grid cell.  It
</em><br />
should
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really be 'sea_ice_albedo'. We could introduce a new name of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'sea_ice_albedo_assuming_no_snow' but I'm not sure whether it is
</em><br />
really
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct to use the &quot;assuming&quot; phrase here.  Perhaps it would be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accurate to use the existing name 'sea_ice_albedo' and introduce a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; area_type of 'snow_free_ice'. I'd welcome opinions on this.
</em><br />
<br />Jonathan wrote:

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that would be a correct description, yes. This area-type is
</em><br />
the counterpart of

</em><br />
snow_free_sea_ice.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still support the need for a sea ice albedos, my comments on whether

grid. Alison's

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggestion of an area type snow_free_ice could help distinguish it is

bare, but if the snow
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depth is also known, then that would be clearer, though there will be

transition months as
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ice becomes snow free.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So is one total sea ice albedo sufficient?
</em><br />
<br />One CF standard name for sea ice albedo is sufficient if it is
<br />
essentially the same geophysical quantity for snow covered/bare sea ice.
<br />
Then the only issue is to distinguish between surface types and this is
<br />
the role of the area_types.  Area types of snow_free_sea_ice and
<br />
snow_on_sea_ice would allow you to make that distinction, so I am in
<br />
favour of introducing one new standard name of sea_ice_albedo, plus the
<br />
new area_types.
<br />
<br />Again regarding CMIP5, Karl would be the person to contact if you wish
<br />
to save the albedo for both surface types as currently only the bare ice
<br />
quantity is listed in the output document.  The quantity
<br />
surface_snow_thickness is listed as an output with a cell_methods of
<br />
'mean where sea'. If you wanted the same quantity saved with a
<br />
cell_methods of 'mean where sea_ice' then I think it would be a separate
<br />
output.  In practice, would the quantity that is already being saved be
<br />
enough to tell you whether the ice is bare?
<br />
<br />10) We are agreed to use the existing names
<br />
surface_downward_x_stress; Pa
<br />
surface_downward_y_stress; Pa
<br />
and introduce two new standard names
<br />
upward_x_stress_at_sea_ice_base; Pa
<br />
upward_y_stress_at_sea_ice_base; Pa
<br />
(all accompanied by a cell_methods attribute of &quot;area: mean where
<br />
sea_ice&quot; for CMIP5.)
<br />
<br />The new names are accepted for inclusion in the standard name table.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
