Hi folks,
<br />
<br />I just joined the list, so I apologize for breaking the threading, and 
<br />
being out of the loop, but Rich Signell alerted me that you were 
<br />
discussing a format for particle tracking models, and we'd like to be 
<br />
involved.
<br />
<br />A couple introductory comments:
<br />
<br />We (NOAA Emergency Response Division) have a particle tracking model 
<br />
(GNOME) we use for oil, chemical, and random-other-stuff spills. For the 
<br />
most part, our output is in our own special formats, and doesn't 
<br />
interact well with other tools -- we'd like to change that, and we're 
<br />
going to netcdf for everything else, so we want to use it for this, too.
<br />
<br />We use netcdf from C/C++ and Python, so would rather not do anything 
<br />
supported only in the Java libs. We're also on netcdf3 at this point, 
<br />
though we can upgrade to netcdf4 if there is a compelling reason.
<br />
<br />Our model, at this point, keeps the number of particles constant (though 
<br />
some may be flagged as &quot;not released&quot; or &quot;off map&quot;, or &quot;evaporated&quot; or 
<br />
what have you. As a result, the &quot;natural&quot; way that we have stored the 
<br />
results (in netcdf and other) is in (num_timesteps X num_particles) arrays.
<br />
<br />We then have arrays for latitude, longitude, mass, various flags, etc.
<br />
<br />As discussed here, other folks' models change the number of particles as 
<br />
time goes on, so such a simple block storage won't work. Our case is a 
<br />
subset of the more general case, to it should be easy to support the 
<br />
simple case anyway (and we may well add variable particle numbers in the 
<br />
future as well)
<br />
<br />When looking at the docs for PointObservationConventions, it didn't seem 
<br />
to fit quite right. One key point is that for the most part, we think of 
<br />
the collection of particles as an entity -- we are far more likely to be 
<br />
interested in the whole collection at one point in time, than the path 
<br />
of a particular particle over time. In fact, it's rare the we care at 
<br />
all about the ID of a particular particle -- we simply want to know its 
<br />
properties at a given time -- so it would be nice if the data storage 
<br />
could do that efficiently.
<br />
<br />We'd generally want time to be the unlimited dimension, as well, as we 
<br />
tend to run the models and analysis forward in time, and might well want 
<br />
to incrementally output the data.
<br />
<br />It seems ragged arrays are called for, though I've never tried to do 
<br />
that in netcdf, so I don't know what the issues are. Are ragged arrays a 
<br />
netcdf4-only feature?
<br />
<br />Of course, another option is to allocate the full amount of space 
<br />
required to store the maximum number, and then mask off the invalid 
<br />
ones. With compression, that may not be too bad a way to go.
<br />
<br />A few specific comments:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I now write the data with redundant time as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a limited dimension, and records(time, latitude, longitude) and have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mass (record), radius(record) etc.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Thanks anyway,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Ute
</em><br />
<br />Do you have an example output file for that you could share?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clearly there is a need for another Point Convention type to handle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the output from particle tracking models like this.
</em><br />
<br />I think so too -- it really is a different use case.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. I think trajectory is when you follow a set of &quot;things&quot;, boats, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person. But at each time step they are identical, maybe not the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number because of missing data. I could assume that I have a trajectory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but actually I can't be sure if my particles are the same as before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore I chose not to take that convention.
</em><br />
<br />hmm -- it sounds like this is similar to what I was talking about above 
<br />
-- the collection of particles at a given time is what's important -- 
<br />
not the path of any given particle.
<br />
<br />As a not, we've been working some with the CDOG (deepwater blowout 
<br />
model), and it doesn't keep track of which particles are which as they 
<br />
are added an removed, either -- so it's a pretty common use case.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be thousands or tens of thousands of particles, so it's not feasible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to write each trajectory into a separate file.
</em><br />
<br />nor does that fit that natural data model -- one file per timestep would 
<br />
make more sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We want a featureType that will allow us to write the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collection of particles at each time step into a single file, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will allow us to extract all the particles at a single time step, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well as extract individual particle trajectories by their ID.
</em><br />
<br />well said.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; whereas as you describe it the time coord is common to all trajectories
</em><br />
<br />yup.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  To arrange this, an indirection could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time dimension:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   data(i,o)     x(i,o) y(i,o) z(i,o) t(tindex(i,o))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where i is the instance (which of the trajectories), o is the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; along that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trajectory, t is the coordinate vector of common times, and tindex is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; index
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to t. For example, we might have these two trajectories (x,t) (omitting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; y and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; z for simplicity)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   (0,10) (1,11) (2,12)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          (3,11) (2,12) (1,13) (0,14)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then t would be [10,11,12,13,14] (all the times). For the first trajectory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   x=[0,1,2] tindex=[0,1,2]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and for the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   x=[3,2,1,0] tindex=[1,2,3,4]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that right? Perhaps/probably there's a neater or more natural way to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do it.
</em><br />
<br />I'm having trouble following that -- but yes, it does not seem natural.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The synchronization of coordinates opens a potential door to great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplicity of representation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     metadata(i)    data(i,o)     x(i,o) y(i,o) z(i,o) t(o)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where i is the instance (which of the trajectories), o is simply the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time index.  The possible costs are proliferation in numbers of ways to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represent similar things and file size.   The question that I'd be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inclined to ask of Ute and Rich would be a judgment call on the cost in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; file size that would result from filling missing values at the start/end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of each individual trajectory.
</em><br />
<br />If you're going to do that, you could just store it as one big 
<br />
rectangular array, with missing values marked (see above). Which sure 
<br />
would be easy but costly in storage space.
<br />
<br />Another problem -- you may not know the maximum number of particles at 
<br />
time zero -- so you can't know how much space to allocate when you start 
<br />
writing the file -- that may kill that approach.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Optionally the metadata could include
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     tstart_index(i)   tend_index(i)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This representation seems _the simplest from the standpoint of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; application code (reading)_.  Synoptic view are simply projection at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fixed &quot;o&quot; index;  the history of an individual trajectory is simply a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; projection at a fixed &quot;i&quot; index.
</em><br />
<br />How do you do this with a ragged array? I'm missing something.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Does the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saving of space through not padding the trajectories justify the complexity?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know.
</em><br />
<br />Do you have a choice if you don't know what your maximum number of 
<br />
particles is at the start?
<br />
<br />Thanks all for working on this.
<br />
<br />-Chris
