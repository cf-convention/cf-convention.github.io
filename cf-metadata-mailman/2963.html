Hello List,
<br />
<br />Since I'm also dealing a bit with data sets holding &quot;particle
<br />
collections&quot; through time, I'd like to contribute some thoughts
<br />
regarding this. Our primary use here at SINTEF is for inputs to and
<br />
results from oil drift simulations, so we're dealing mostly at the sea
<br />
surface and below, although it appears to me that similar data sets are
<br />
just as applicable up in the atmosphere as well. (Particle collections
<br />
and bounding polygons for the ash cloud from the Eyjafjallaj?kull
<br />
eruption springs to mind as a fairly recent example.)
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data for whatever particles currently exist.
</em><br />
<br />This is a very fair assessment in our case. One could generalize a bit
<br />
more: We have data organized as a series of time steps (as the primary
<br />
dimension). At each time step we have a number of &quot;data&quot; to store, and
<br />
they are of various sizes and types. Particles are but one of these
<br />
kinds of objects. Most of them may probably be treated similar to
<br />
particles, though, where a fixed set of properties describing each
<br />
object can simply be represented by a separate netCDF variable per property.
<br />
<br />A more nasty example could be to represent an oil slick's shape and
<br />
position with a polygon. The number of vertices of that polygon would be
<br />
highly variable through time. (This is a typical GIS-like representation.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I assume that if you wanted to break up the data for a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long run, you would partition by time, ie time steps 1-1000,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1001-2000, etc. would be in seperate files.
</em><br />
<br />How one decides to partition I think can depend a lot on the
<br />
application. Sometimes splitting them on data type can be more
<br />
appropriate. In a recent case I had, the data were to be transferred to
<br />
a client computer over the Internet for viewing locally. In that case
<br />
reducing the content of the file to the absolute minimum set of
<br />
properties (that the client needed in order to visualize) became
<br />
paramount. Even a fast Internet connection does have bandwidth
<br />
limitations... :-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Apparently the common read pattern is to retrieve the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles at a given time step. If so, that makes things easier.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, often sequentially by time as well.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) I assume that you want to be able to figure out an individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particle's trajectory, even if that doesnt need to be optimized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for speed.
</em><br />
<br />Not my primary need, but if an object is &quot;tracked&quot; like that it would
<br />
not be unlikely that the trajectory might need to be accessed
<br />
&quot;interactively&quot;, eg. while a user is viewing a visualization of the data
<br />
directly on screen. Does that count as &quot;optimized for speed&quot;?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) is the avg number (Navg) of particles that exist much smaller,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or approx the same as the max number (Nmax) that exist at one time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step?
</em><br />
<br />This varies a lot. Sometimes it is like you suggest, but sometimes maybe
<br />
only a few. Sometimes there isn't any defined Nmax either (dynamic
<br />
implementations), or such a limit can be difficult to know beforehand.
<br />
<br />Even where an Nmax is set, would it be unreasonable to require the
<br />
_same_ value to be used every time if the netCDF dataset was accumulated
<br />
through _multiple_ simulation runs?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2)  How much data is associated with each particle at a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time step (just an estimate needed here - 10 bytes? 1000 bytes?)
</em><br />
<br />In our case this varies a lot with type of particle, and how the
<br />
simulation was set up. A quick assessment indicates that some are only
<br />
16 bytes per particle, while others may currently require up to 824
<br />
bytes. (This does not account for shared info like the time itself,
<br />
which we don't store per particle.) It also wouldn't be very atypical if
<br />
this amount is then to be multiplied by say 20000 particles per time step.
<br />
<br /><br />Hope that provides some useful ideas of the real-life needs!
<br />
:-)
