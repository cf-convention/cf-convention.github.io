Hi Roy,
<br />
<br />the best review I know on those issues is that by Lewis (1980) on PSS-78 and
<br />
its antecendents, reprinted in Unesco #37 of 1981.
<br />
<br />There Lewis says that from the 1950s on electrical conductivity was used
<br />
to replace chlorinity titration, based on the  work of Thomas, Thompson and
<br />
Utterback (1934) on the electrical conductivity of seawater.
<br />
<br />I do not know the latter paper but I assume that those authors correlated
<br />
conductivity with Knudsen salinity, since Knudsen salinity was the only
<br />
official salinity definition until about 1961 when JPOTS was established
<br />
to consider those problems more deeply and finally introduced PSS-78.
<br />

<br /><br />Hello Reiner/Trevor,
<br />
<br />I have no problem with introducing the term Knudsen salinity for salinities 
<br />
pre-dating PSS-78.  A question to Reiner is does the term just apply to 
<br />
salinity by evaporation/titration or is it equally applicable to salinity 
<br />
data obtained by the STDs and CTDs with home-grown conductivity to salinity 
<br />
algorithms in use before PSS-78 brought some order to the world?
<br />
<br />Note, that having a term for pre-78 data doesn't necessarily allow us to 
<br />
immediately deprecate the term 'salinity'.  There's a lot of data out there 
<br />
marked up with 'salinity'. Anyone any views on how such deprecation should 
<br />
be managed?  My vote would be to set up the new terms and modify the 
<br />
'salinity' definition in the next Standard Names update, map all the new 
<br />
terms as narrowMatches to old one and then deprecate 'salinity' in a future 
<br />
Standard Names update.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />
<br />Since the use of any &quot;salinity&quot; was discouraged in favour of chlorinity in
<br />
1940,
<br />
all archived pre-78 salinities should be Knudsen salinities, originally
<br />
calculated
<br />
from chlorinity by the Knudsen formula derived from the evaporation
<br />
experiments
<br />
of Soerensen in 1900.
<br />
<br />Knudsen salinity is consistent with PSS-78 at about S = 35 but deviates
<br />
systematically for brackish water, see our 2008 salinity paper in DSR.
<br />
<br />The term &quot;Knudsen salinity&quot; is well understood, I think.

<br /><br />Hello Roy,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You make a good point about the pre 1978 data.  Perhaps we need yet
<br />
another name, such as &quot;Pre78salinity&quot; to indicate that it was probably
<br />
obtained by chemical titration.  By introducing such a salinity will have
<br />
the advantage of reducing the present ambiguity which calls this older data
<br />
by the same name as Practical Salinity, namely &quot;salinity&quot;.

<br />
<br />Hello Trevor,
<br />
<br />I totally agree that we should stop using 'salinity' from now on.  I also
<br />
agree that virtually all post-1983 (not 1980: it took 5 years to get the
<br />
1978 Equation of State published by UNESCO) data labelled 'salinity' are in
<br />
fact 'practical_salinity'.  However, as an oceanographic data centre we have
<br />
salinity data going back to the early 1900s and other centres such as ICES
<br />
have data going back further than that. These have been determined by a
<br />
variety of methodologies but are mostly chemical titrations or a variety of
<br />
algorithmic determinations from conductivity that are significantly
<br />
different from the PSS-78 scale. Replacing 'salinity' by
<br />
'practical_salinity' re-labels these data, which I believe is wrong.
<br />
<br />We certainly need to get 'practical_salinity' names in place and alter the
<br />
definition for salinity to indicate that it means 'salt content by any
<br />
method' with wording to strongly discourage its use for post-1983 data
<br />
unless the data are known to be 'non-practical' (which exist: we have some).
<br />
We also need to explain to the community that unless they change the labels
<br />
on their data that are practical salinity from 'salinity' to
<br />
'practical_salinity' then their data will be regarded as useless for many
<br />
physical oceanographic applications.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />
<br />Dear all,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of repeating ourselves, because there are now (at least)
<br />
three different salinities, it is now ambiguous and confusing to call any
<br />
salinity &quot;Salinity&quot;.  The Announcement of TEOS-10 that is now appearing in
<br />
all 22 oceanographic journals specifically recommends that the use of the
<br />
word &quot;Salinity&quot; cease immediately, and that either the words &quot;Practical
<br />
Salinity&quot; or &quot;Absolute Salinity&quot; be used.  The reason of course is to
<br />
minimise ambiguity.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is where the community (including CF-metadata) will have to end
<br />
up:- we have been requested to do so by IOC, SCOR and IAPSO.  So we may as
<br />
well do it now, in my view.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that all ocean models run to date have used Practical Salinity as
<br />
their &quot;Salinity&quot; variable,, and all equations of state since 1980 have been
<br />
in terms of Practical Salinity.  So there is no slight-of-hand in calling
<br />
these variables &quot;Practical Salinity&quot;; rather it is just being specific as to
<br />
what this type of salinity always has been.  That is &quot;Practical Salinity&quot; is
<br />
simply the long-hand name of what we have been calling &quot;Salinity&quot; for 30
<br />
years.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trevor

<br />Dear All,
<br />
<br />My feelings on this were (and still are) comfort with the addition of
<br />
'practical_salinity' names, but significant discomfort with the replacement
<br />
of 'salinity' by 'practical_salinity' through deprecation of 'salinity'.

<br />Dear Paul

<br />Alison (the manager of standard names) hasn't &quot;ruled&quot; yet on their
<br />
inclusion,
<br />
but I believe that the discussion concluded with no objections to adding

the practical salinity names. It seems safe to assume they will be put in
