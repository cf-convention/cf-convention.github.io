Hi Upendra and Jim,
<br />
<br />Thanks for answering my questions about capabilities of the viewing sofware
<br />
e.g ncBrowse and also the ideas around aggregation.
<br />
<br />A NCML enhancement to allow aggregation of different sized depth/pressure arrays 
<br />
could
<br />
be very useful for ocean profile data from e.g. CTD, ARGO, Glider and XBT 
<br />
instruments.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Andrew

<br /><br />Hi,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Jim is talking about NCML (virtual) aggregation. THREDDS can 
<br />
aggregate even when the variable is a scalar using &quot;joinNew&quot;. But I think 
<br />
THREDDS can aggregate only over regular arrays. That is, all the dimensions 
<br />
other than over which a variable is aggregated should be of same size across all 
<br />
the files. This is possible, for example, only if all the profiles have same 
<br />
depth( or pressure) levels. Which in general is not true. NCML aggregation I 
<br />
guess is of limited use when dealing with jagged arrays. But I agree with Jim in 
<br />
that ability to aggregate should be an important consideration when coming up 
<br />
with a representation. Physical aggregation is still possible. But I prefer 
<br />
virtual aggregation, since letting data to be stored in individual files in 
<br />
often operationally convenient, but users benefit from aggregated views. I 
<br />
wonder if NCML could be extended to be able to aggregate jagged arrays into 
<br />
incomplete multidimensional array representations.  I heard that ERDDAP has 
<br />
similar capability though I don't think it has anything like NCML where users 
<br />
can create views over remote data, not sure though.

Hi.
<br />
<br /><br />A colleague of mine has told me that if you use size-1 array for a variable, 
<br />
then data servers such as THREDDS can aggregate the variable over multiple files 
<br />
and deliver a single file in which the variables will be arrays of size &gt; 1.  He 
<br />
said that if a variable is a scalar, THREDDS won't do this.  (I don't mess with 
<br />
THREDDS, so I am just parroting what he said.)
<br />
<br /><br />If this is correct, then you might want to consider this point when deciding 
<br />
which way to represent coordinates.

<br />Andrew,
<br />
<br />However I have another small concern about all of this. Given there is more than
<br />
1 way to treat dimensions does the netCDF plotting and visualising sofware out
<br />
there understand both approaches. That is can we expect something like
<br />
ncBrowse, IDV or ODV? give me a plot of say salinity vs. pressure
<br />
and work OK with BOTH approaches to coding the netCDF?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Software like ncBrowse do not understand CF conventions. They can read netCDF 
<br />
files, but wouldn't know how to interpret the attributes like &quot;coordinates&quot;. So 
<br />
if you want to plot the profile location on a map, for example, it wouldn't be 
<br />
able to do it by itself. It would need to be told how to interpret the 
<br />
coordinates.  A CF based software wouldn't have to be supplied with the 
<br />
additional semantics since it can read from the file by itself. But if you want 
<br />
to plot salinity vs pressure,  software like ncBrowse can already do it since 
<br />
lot of these software make it easy to make plots based on a shared dimension. 
<br />
And here salinity and pressure share the same dimension.  So I guess, the 
<br />
correct answer to your question is - it depends on what kind of plot or task you 
<br />
want to do and if the software can understand CF conventions.

<br /><br />Hi Upendra,
<br />
<br />I like the idea of a station dimension.  It goes a long way to resolving the 
<br />
issue raised in my response to Jim which was based on the tunnel vision of 
<br />
having pressure/depth as a dimension.  I have yet to look at the recently 
<br />
published NODC NetCDF templates.  Is this CTD encoding included in them?  If so, 
<br />
I'll bump up looking at them on my 'todo' list. I'd also recommend that Andrew 
<br />
and my colleagues in SeaDataNet take a look.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br /><br />Hi Andrew,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way it should be okay as far as CF compliance is concerned. But the 
<br />
dimensions - latitude, longitude and time are not really required.  If it is 
<br />
required to indicate that there is only one station(profile) in the file, there 
<br />
could be a dimension for number of stations instead, with a value of 1. Also, 
<br />
using a station dimension is the way to go if storing a collection of profiles 
<br />
in a single file. Here at NODC, we took the approach that we would use the same 
<br />
consistent representation whether there is a single instance or a collection in 
<br />
a file.

We are working on coding up some 1000's netCDF files off CTD

<br />
like TEMPERATURE(TIME,LATITUDE,LONGITUDE,PRESSURE) or just 1 dimension

like I have above i.e. TEMPERATURE(PRESSURE). ?
