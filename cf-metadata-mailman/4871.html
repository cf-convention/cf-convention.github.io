Dear Jon
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just to repeat a remark that Steve Hankin made whose implications have not been explored in this discussion: different countries adopted the Gregorian calendar at different times.  (Greece didn't adopt it till 1923!)  So what is considered a valid Gregorian date varies from country to country (and some of those countries don't even exist any more, or at least the boundaries have changed...)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. The non-proleptic Gregorian calendar is extremely problematic for historical observations as well as for models (astronomers use the Julian calendar consistently for this reason).
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's right. Nonetheless I don't think we can abolish the real-world
<br />
calendar, despite its ambiguities, because it's the one we really use! It is
<br />
not realistic to expect users of CF for historical obs to convert their dates
<br />
to the Julian calendar, I suspect, even if we say they should.
<br />
<br />My proposal for the strict_gregorian calendar is to limit the danger
<br />
of the *default* calendar by forcing the calendar to be specified in cases
<br />
where there's a high risk of problems e.g. with a reference date of 1-1-1, so
<br />
that people are made aware of the danger. We could instead make it mandatory
<br />
always to specify the calendar, as has already been suggested i.e. not allow
<br />
a default at all. Would you prefer that?
<br />
<br />As you say, we should be clearer about what the real-world calendar means, in
<br />
cases where users really want to use it. Adopting the earliest Julian-Gregorian
<br />
switch-over date is consistent with udunits and has some logic. It means that
<br />
dates would have to be converted for historical obs from countries which did
<br />
not convert at first. People working with historical data are aware of
<br />
different calendars being in use, so that seems more likely to be done than
<br />
converting to an other-wordly Julian calendar. Alternatively we could leave
<br />
it undefined, as it is now, but I don't think that's satisfactory. There must
<br />
be instrumental data affected by late switch-over e.g. in Greece and Russia. We
<br />
ought to say which calendar CF expects to be used for this.
<br />
<br />udunits doesn't say what calendar the ref date is in because udunits supports
<br />
only the real-world calendar. I agree CF should be clear about this and the
<br />
obvious rule is that the ref date is in the calendar you are using. As you
<br />
say, that would be sensible. Any other choice would be rather bizarre.
<br />
<br />The use of units of time which are calendar-based (months and years) is
<br />
deprecated in CF. That's because those units are not helpful, as you say,
<br />
unless you have calendar-aware software to interpret them, and some additional
<br />
rules on how that interpretation should be done e.g. what does 31 Jan 2012
<br />
+ 1 month mean? I think this is a different issue from calendars, since it
<br />
applies to any calendar which has variable-length months.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
