Dear all
<br />
<br />I think Philip's posting points out that this disagreement is partly caused by
<br />
a confusion. I agree with his distinction of two cases.
<br />
<br />Perhaps in Ken's use case, the standard deviation describes the spread of a
<br />
number of measurements that are regarded as samples from a population. The
<br />
difference between the samples is random error, not a dependence on time or
<br />
space that is of interest to the user of the dataset. This also sounds like
<br />
what Nan means by, &quot;We collect in situ data, and I know that MANY of our
<br />
instruments output the mean of several measurements, few do single spot
<br />
samples.&quot; If the instrument itself does not output the individual
<br />
measurements, the variation among them as a function of time or space is
<br />
obviously of no geophysical interest.
<br />
<br />I agree that this standard deviation is a kind of measurement property. As Ken
<br />
says, the standard error is usually calculated as the sample standard
<br />
deviation divided by the square root of the number in the sample. However I
<br />
appreciate that you might wish to report the standard deviation instead of the
<br />
standard error. To do this, I agree that we would need a new standard_name
<br />
modifier, which I suggest should be sample_standard_deviation to avoids its
<br />
being confused with any other kind of standard deviation.
<br />
<br />Perhaps that is the answer I should have given to Ken's first question, instead
<br />
of asking whether it was a temporal or a spatial standard deviation. In fact it
<br />
is neither.
<br />
<br />Going on to the wider question, I agree with Ken that a mean is just as much a
<br />
statistical operation as a standard deviation. Only a point measurement (which
<br />
is also one of the cell_methods of Appendix E) is the &quot;true&quot; geophysical
<br />
quantity. All the other methods are statistical ways of representing variation
<br />
of that quantity within the cell. It probably doesn't seem surprising to
<br />
regard a mean as the &quot;same&quot; quantity, nor the mode and median perhaps, but
<br />
maybe you begin to feel uncomfortable when moving on to the maximum and
<br />
minimum, the range (absolute difference between max and min, which is going to
<br />
be added as a cell_method in the next version of CF,
<br />
<a href="https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/65">https://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/65</a>), and finally the standard deviation
<br />
and the variance, the last of which has different units. All these methods
<br />
belong to the same family, and it seems to me it would be arbitrary and
<br />
therefore unsatisfactory to choose a certain level of surprise or discomfort
<br />
in order to decide when it was no longer the &quot;same&quot; geophysical quantity. The
<br />
only solution, I think, is for everyone to learn that the standard name is
<br />
only a *part* of the description of the attribute, as John says.
<br />
<br />John asked whether the difference between cell_methods and standard_name
<br />
modifiers could be clearly stated. My understanding is that standard_name
<br />
modifiers denote ancillary variables (they were introduced to CF at the same
<br />
time), whose purpose is to provide metadata about the individual values of
<br />
another data variable (start of section 3.4), while cell methods indicate the
<br />
statistical methods whereby the data values represent variation within cells.
<br />
This is a difference, but it might not be sufficiently obvious to require them
<br />
to be different features in CF.
<br />
<br />The sample standard deviation *could* be represented by cell_methods, if we
<br />
introduced a notional axis of sample, to index the samples, and then collapsed
<br />
it to size one, like we do for a time-mean or a zonal mean. The sample
<br />
standard deviation would then be described in cell_methods as &quot;sample:
<br />
standard_deviation&quot;. Likewise, the number of observations could be regarded as
<br />
a cell_method that counted the size of its (sample) axis. If we do not wish
<br />
to maintain the difference, we could simplify the standard by abolishing
<br />
standard_name modifiers and creating some new cell_methods, some of which
<br />
might be of a different kind from before because they wouldn't refer to a
<br />
particular axis.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
