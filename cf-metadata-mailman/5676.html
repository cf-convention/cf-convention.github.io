Hi John,
<br />
<br />Couple of points:
<br />
<br />Biogenic silica isn't simply silicon dioxide - it's the hydrated amorphous form commonly known as opal. How about replacing 'silicon dioxide' by 'hydrated silicon dioxide (opal)'?
<br />
<br />I find 'moles_of_nitrogen_per_unit_mass_in_sea_water' ambiguous. Do you mean dissolved, particulate or particulate+dissolved and organic, inorganic or total (organic+inorganic). I'm guessing you're aiming at dissolved NO3+NO2+NH4, in which case 'dissolved_total_inorganic_nitrogen' might suit.
<br />
<br />Possible replace 'Chlorophyll is the green pigment ' by 'Chlorophylls are the green pigments'. There's also at least six of them if the divinyl forms are taken into account - maybe replacing 'five' by 'several' is the way to go.
<br />
<br />I'm not totally comfortable with the organic carbon definition - it doesn't really tell me anything. How about 'Organic carbon is the carbon remaining in a sample after carbonates and bicarbonates have been removed by acidification'
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

Subject: [CF-metadata] request #1 for names: mole concentrations and mass       fractions, similar to current names
<br />
<br />Hi,
<br />
<br />This is the first in a series of standard name requests.   I've tried to group the requests meaningfully, and I apologize in advance if I need a fair bit of CF wisdom going forward through this process.
<br />
<br />In this set of requests, there is a reasonable similarity to other existing names, and I've given an example or two for comparison under the &quot;Analogs&quot; section for each.
<br />
<br />-- Name: mole_concentration_of_particulate_matter_expressed_as_biogenic_silicon_per_unit_mass_in_sea_water
<br />
-- Units: mol kg -1
<br />
-- Definition:  Concentration in sea water of silicon dioxide particles produced by living organisms, presented as moles per unit mass. Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.
<br />
-- Analogs: mole_concentration_of_particulate_matter_expressed_as_silicon_in_sea_water
<br />
-- Notes: A more narrow form of the analog, and is per unit mass instead of volume
<br />
<br />-- Name: mole_concentration_of_particulate_matter_expressed_as_lithogenic_silicon_per_unit_mass_in_sea_water
<br />
-- Units: mol kg -1
<br />
-- Definition:  Concentration in sea water of silicon dioxide particles produced from terrestrial rocks and soil, presented as moles per unit mass. The concept moles_of_X_per_unit_mass_in_Y is also called &quot;molality&quot; of X in Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.
<br />
-- Analogs: mole_concentration_of_particulate_matter_expressed_as_silicon_in_sea_water
<br />
-- Notes: A more narrow form of the analog, and is per unit mass instead of volume
<br />
<br />-- Name: moles_of_nitrogen_per_unit_mass_in_sea_water
<br />
-- Units: mol kg-1
<br />
-- Definition: Concentration of nitrogen in sea water, presented as number of moles per unit mass. The concept moles_of_X_per_unit_mass_in_Y is also called &quot;molality&quot; of X in Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.
<br />
-- Analogs: moles_of_nitrate_per_unit_mass_in_sea_water
<br />
-- Notes: Is this better as &quot;mole_concentration_of_nitrogen_per_unit_mass_in_sea_water&quot;, to match a more prevalent pattern?
<br />
<br />-- Name: mole_concentration_of_dissolved_phosphorus_per_unit_mass_in_sea_water
<br />
-- Units: mol kg-1
<br />
-- Definition: Concentration of dissolved phosphorus in sea water, presented as number of moles per unit mass. The concept moles_of_X_per_unit_mass_in_Y is also called &quot;molality&quot; of X in Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.
<br />
-- Analogs: mole_concentration_of_particulate_organic_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />-- Name: mass_fraction_of_chlorophyll_a_in_sea_water
<br />
-- Units: 1
<br />
-- Definition: Proportion of the chlorophyll a pigment in sea water. Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Chlorophyll is the green pigment found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; it's presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. There are five different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally; all contain a chlorin ring which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies. Chlorophyll-a is the most commonly occurring form of natural chlorophyll.
<br />
-- Analogs: mass_concentration_of_chlorophyll_a_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />-- Name: mass_fraction_of_particulate_organic_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
-- Units: 1
<br />
-- Definition:  Proportion of carbon particles from organic sources in sea water. Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Organic carbon describes a family of chemical species and is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. Particulate organic carbon is in the form of particles too big to pass through a filter.
<br />
-- Analogs: mole_concentration_of_particulate_organic_matter_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water, mass_fraction_of_primary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol_in_air
<br />
-- Notes:  Is this better as &quot;mass_fraction_of_particulate_organic_matter_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water&quot;? I don't understand the purpose of the indirection &quot;particulate_organic_matter_expressed_as_X&quot;, as opposed to just &quot;particulate_organic_X&quot;, but it appears to be a pattern.
<br />
<br />Thank you for your consideration of these requests.
<br />
<br />John
