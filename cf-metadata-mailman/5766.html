Hello Nan
<br />
<br />I appreciate your concern and recognise the importance of maintaining consistency.
<br />
<br />I think the github tools, and the svn tools for that matter, do provide 'a VERY clear record of changes' enabling a reviewer to see exactly what has occurred at each stage.
<br />
<br />In addition, I think that we have good processes in place raising issues and discussing them via Trac tickets to reach consensus on wording and intent, before any change is agreed.  This should deliver a coherent result to be added to the conventions document.
<br />
<br />Whilst I agree that a review of the text is needed following the actual document change, I don't think this is so onerous a task, as the Trac ticket should state the conclusion of the discussion, which has normally had input from a number of interested parties, many of whom are particularly focused on the clear and consistent wording of the change.  The reviewer is providing a second pass filter, based on their knowledge of the document.
<br />
<br />Without losing sight of the goal of a clear and consistent specification, I think we can deliver an update to the document in a swift but carefully controlled manner by managing the editing process collaboratively.
<br />
<br />all the best
<br />
mark

<br />
<br />I'd just like to weigh in on the importance of a reviewer, or reviewers, who will
<br />
devote the time to check the whole document for consistency after each change.
<br />
This is a really  big problem for a project I'm involved with, where we rely on
<br />
Alfresco and &quot;track changes&quot; in Word.
<br />
<br />So, to me, using the right technology is crucial. I admit that I'm not familiar with
<br />
github, but I really hope that it, or whatever system is decided upon,  will provide
<br />
a VERY clear record of changes.
<br />
<br />I understand the desire to speed up the process, I'm just hoping that it doesn't
<br />
become chaotic.
<br />
<br />The advantage is that the person with responsibility for the whole
<br />
does not have to make all the edits themselves -- yet they can easily
<br />
see and review how the edits look
<br />
<br />I'm also concerned that this will make it more difficult, not less, for &quot;the person
<br />
with responsibility for the whole&quot;. Making edits can sometimes be a lot simpler
<br />
than understanding what someone else has done.
<br />
<br />Cheers - Nan

The important factor for me is the work flow and people, not the technology. Git and github are a bit nicer to work with than svn, the merging is a bit better etc but we can support collaborative editing either way around.
<br />
<br />I will vote for github as it has a number of useful tools and the work flow is a little neater and more transparent but it's not the vital factor.  We can leave CF-Trac as is and still use either tool option.
<br />
<br />What I think is valuable is that a number of people make edits to the conventions document and a reviewer casts their eye of each change set to ensure coherence and merge this in.
<br />
<br />I think there are a number of busy people who could spare a little time to write up an approved trac ticket and a number of busy people very familiar with the CF Conventions document who could spare a little time to review a single merge request based on one ticket and merge it or return it for rework.
<br />
<br />My observation is that there is not one busy person who can spare enough time to do this for all the approved but unfinished trac tickets.
<br />
<br />It may be that having one reviewer, responsible for consistency, and multiple editors still presents a significant speed up compared to now, but I am not completely convinced that one person needs to be responsible for the whole document.
<br />
<br />Before we get to far into technology discussions, can we agree that in principle that multiple editors with a 'review then merge' process is a good idea?
<br />
Or are there reasons why multiple editors and reviewers is not preferred, accepting that this puts a large lag time on publishing?
<br />
<br />If we agree this thought process and that we can do something about it then I'll engage with whatever technology is put in front of me. Github is a slight preference in my mind, but whatever's quickest to get up and running has to be a worthwhile candidate.
<br />
<br />I assume changes and new accounts to the CF SVN system are managed at PCMDI so I don't know how easy it is for someone with administration rights to engage with this.
<br />
<br />For github we can create a new 'organization' in a few minutes and put the conventions source in as a project. I can help with this, but it doesn't need me, it's easy to do.
<br />
<br />The challenge is agreeing roles and responsibilities, this is an issue of people, not of technology, in my mind.
<br />
<br />all the best

<br />
<br />Jonathan,
<br />
<br />The good thing about the git &quot;pull request&quot; method of updating
<br />
CF-conventions would be that someone can fork the repository (make
<br />
their own copy of the document, in this case), make the edits related
<br />
to their issue, and then submit a &quot;pull request&quot; to the person with
<br />
authority to update the master document.
<br />
<br />The advantage is that the person with responsibility for the whole
<br />
does not have to make all the edits themselves -- yet they can easily
<br />
see and review how the edits look in a revised copy, and these can be
<br />
accepted or discussed further with the community.
<br />
<br />So basically best of both worlds: easier for the community to
<br />
contribute, and less work for the person with responsibility to
<br />
maintain the master.
<br />
<br />-Rich
