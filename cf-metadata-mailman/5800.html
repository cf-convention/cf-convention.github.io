Hi everybody,
<br />
<br />after a good while and a new round of iterations, I'd like to come back to a previously proposed set of new standard names for atmospheric aerosol properties that are commonly measured in ground stations around the globe. The list has been somewhat modified and amended as compared to my last proposal. A common characteristic of these standard names is that they are to be used not only in NetCDF-CF files, but also in data discovery portals, i.e. independent from a file. They therefore contain some details that could be deduced by looking at the file itself, but will be of great help in describing the content of a file without looking at it. One such example is the use of the prefix &quot;surface_&quot; as described on the CF standard names syntax webpage, where it says that this prefix describes a property at the lower boundary of the atmosphere.
<br />
<br /><br />Another specialty of the proposed names is the use of the phrase &quot;_due_to_dried_aerosol&quot;. Ground stations in the WMO GAW network are supposed to measure the aerosol properties at dry state (RH &lt; 40%), but especially in the tropics, it may be impossible to reach this target RH and the drying may be incomplete. Using such a standard name in a file requires a co-ordinate variable &quot;relative_humidity&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The set of proposed standard names also contains 2 auxiliary variables to be used as coordinates for other standard names (see end of list).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I'm curious for your comments.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Markus

To specify the relative humidity at which the property applies, provide scalar coordinate variable with the standard name of &quot;relative_humidity&quot;. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency needs to be specified to indicate that the property applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies.
