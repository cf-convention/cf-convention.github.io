Dear all
<br />
<br />For me it's an important principle that the standard names encapsulate a sign
<br />
convention when relevant, and that's been the case ever since we started to
<br />
define them 15 years ago. This is important because unclear sign conventions
<br />
are a real nuisance for data analysis. There hasn't been a need for an
<br />
explicit statement about &quot;depth&quot; because it is clear from the definition in
<br />
English, I would argue. We would not need two distinct standard names of depth
<br />
(vertical distance below the surface) and height (vertical distance above the
<br />
surface) if the sign convention was arbitrary, because an ambiguous sign would
<br />
make them synonymous. I would suggest that the inclusion of these two distinct
<br />
names is itself a statement that the sign is not arbitrary. It would be odd to
<br />
allow a height of 10 m above the ground to be encoded as -10 m. Surely no-one
<br />
would think that makes sense according to the definition, would they? If not,
<br />
it equally doesn't make sense to encode a depth of 10 m as -10 m.
<br />
<br />There are many other standard names with implicit sign conventions e.g.
<br />
surface_net_downward_shortwave_flux. A positive number for that quantity
<br />
means a flux which is downward. It would be an error to use the opposite
<br />
sign convention for that quantity. Again, if the sign were arbitrary, we
<br />
would just have called it &quot;net flux&quot;, not &quot;net downward flux&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Isn't the purpose of the standard name is to capture the semantics of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable -- i.e. its physical interpretation?  You are suggesting that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; user of the file (or a search engine) should attach a different meaning to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the concept of &quot;DEPTH&quot; in an ocean model based upon whether it is encoded as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a positive or negative value.  Do we attach a different interpretation to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;TIME&quot; because it is encoded as &quot;days&quot; versus &quot;hours&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think the standard name is intended to capture the semantics (i.e.
<br />
the meaning) of the variable, and that includes its sign, in the case of
<br />
signed quantities. Height means positive upwards, depth means positive
<br />
downwards, temperature means warmer if the number is more positive, sea ice
<br />
thickness is a positive number which is bigger if the sea ice is thicker, and
<br />
so on. I think the user of the file should always apply the same, correct,
<br />
definition when interpreting numbers which have the standard_name of depth,
<br />
which is that, if they are positive, they refer to levels below the surface.
<br />
This is not a matter of units, like days versus hours. Depth is positive
<br />
downwards regardless of whether it is in millimetres or miles, just like
<br />
temperature is more positive when warmer regardless of whether it is Celsius
<br />
or Fahrenheit.
<br />
<br />Ultimately standard names are for humans to interpret. I appreciate that
<br />
software may want to know which way up to plot the vertical axis, and the
<br />
positive attribute is useful for that. It is mandatory for vertical coordinate
<br />
variables (except pressure), so software shouldn't need to look anywhere
<br />
else for that information. As John said in his summary, it's not currently
<br />
in the standard for data variables, but we could change the convention to
<br />
recognise it as an optional attribute of data variables if that would help.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
