<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in various forms, and is easy to work with, it is worth considering, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I don't know what tools are being used to manage the DocBook source, so I
<br />
can't comment on that, but what I'm suggesting is that the XML is a poor
<br />
format for the type of collaborative document editing being proposed -- if
<br />
we don't want to change that part of the process then selection of the
<br />
tools should be entirely up to the folks managing the document. i.e
<br />
determine the requirements, then select the tools.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) We manage the development of the CF-2.x.x document in a source code
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; management system, much like a software project
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) ... the whole fork-pull-request thing for updating the document.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think this is appropriate, and I don't think contributors in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to edit the document. The convention is a document, not a collection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source code files.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think this is where the disconnect is: the convention document is a
<br />
&quot;document&quot;, sure, but it is built from one or more source files -- this
<br />
isn't really different than software.
<br />
<br />In theory, the convention is an abstract concept, and the document is
<br />
simply a description of that convention. but in practice the Document IS
<br />
the convention. So discussion of the convention, and proposals to add to or
<br />
alter it, necessarily involve the actual wording of the document. If you
<br />
are going to propose a change of wording to the document, then it sure
<br />
makes sense to me to propose that change in the document itself. And this
<br />
saves transcribing work as well.
<br />
<br />And even if I am managing a large document all by myself, I would put it in
<br />
git or similar -- much easier to track changes, keep various versions, etc.
<br />
In fact, this is a great example of document-like-software -- it has
<br />
versions, more than one version may be published at one, it need &quot;bug&quot;
<br />
fixes, etc...
<br />
<br />(to be fair -- this _could_ be a bit of the hammer-nail thing -- some of us
<br />
have found that git and gitHub are powerful collaborative tools, so we want
<br />
to use it for everything!)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The trac tickets are mostly about how and why to modify it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illustrated by the proposed change.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah -- &quot;illustrated by the proposed change&quot; -- wouldn't it make sense for
<br />
that to be illustrated right there in the document? That's what we are
<br />
getting at.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is different from software, in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the modified code speaks for itself (to some extent), and is accompanied by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much shorter descriptions of how and why it is has been modified.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think this is a subtle distinction --there are a LOT of small changes to
<br />
code that require a lot of discussion and big-=picture thinking -- and
<br />
combining issues with pull requests facilites this well.
<br />
<br />Also the CF
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doc is a *single* document, so there isn't the need to keep lots of files
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent when making updates. It *could* be broken into lots of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; documents,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I don't see an advantage in that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I do -- but that depends quite a bit on the system being used to build the
<br />
doc -- but no matter, git works on diffs, so changing a small part of one
<br />
big file is very similar to changing a part of one file in a collection of
<br />
files.
<br />
<br />I think that the difficulty in updating the document is not that we have
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconvenient software for doing and facilitating it. It is the intellectual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficulty of working out what the changes should be that makes the process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slow.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is the big one, yes, for sure.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, there is also the case of simple typo-fixing or slight
<br />
clarity enhancements, or addition small examples -- these don't require a
<br />
lot of discussion, so facilitating contributions would be a good thing.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we have agreed a ticket, enacting it in the doc should be simple.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is happpening slowly now, I presume, because of lack of person-time to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do it, rather than that the software is awkward.
</em><br />
<br /><br />exactly -- if the community can do more of that work, then the person-time
<br />
bottlneck is reduced.
<br />
<br />there would still be the need for quality-control - someone would have to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take responsibility for checking that the change was as agreed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />yup -- and a system that makes that easy would help that too. See Rich's
<br />
example in his note in this thread.
