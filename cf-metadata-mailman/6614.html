Thank you for the feeedback

<br />John:
<br />
I like the text
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a model or operational forecast, the number of member realizations within a given ensemble. This provides context for any specific realization, for example orienting a member relative to its original group (even if the group is no longer intact).
<br />
I would like to use this as is in the proposal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reviewing this and going back to your original request, there is still a likely point of confusion for users -- it isn't obvious that &quot;given ensemble&quot; refers not to the currently constituted collection, but to the one originally created with this realization.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want that to be the use case for this standard_name (for everyone), I think 'within a given ensemble' needs to explicitly say something like 'within its originally created ensemble'. And perhaps the standard name itself should follow that thought, something like 'initial_number_of_realizations'.
</em><br />
<br />I had thought about this, but my consideration was that there are ensembles which are created after the fact, not necessarily in the 'originally created' set; e.g. multi-model ensembles.  I considered leaving the name so that it could be used in this context as well.  This is not a strong use case for me, so I would be content to be more specific if that is preferred, but I didn't see the need to, so I left it more general.  I'm happy to be guided on this aspect.
<br />
<br /><br />Jonathan:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you are dealing with an intermediate case, having a subset of the ensemble members, and you want to record how many there originally were in total. Is this a common use case? It seems rather surprising to me. But I'm not sure that's what you mean.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, this is what I mean.  I have one of the ensemble members, I have chosen it from the collection and passed it to a friend, for reasons best known to myself; I want to label it as member x from emsemble of size y.  I am confidently assured this is common practice amongst forecasters and the capability is required.  It has been an explicit part of the GRIB specification for years.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seven of nine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this seems different. It's not the number of members there are, but the ordinal number (7) of this particular member. Why can't that be recorded in a variable with the existing standard_name of realization?
</em><br />
<br />there are two pieces of information here, in CF terms this is:
<br />
realization = 7
<br />
number_of_realizations = 9
<br />
I just unpacked this into a single label, to illustrate the information wanted (but I seem to have reduced clarity again; never mind).

<br />
<br />Hi Mark,
<br />
<br />It is a worry if the definition is a repetition or variant of the words in the name. In particular, the word 'realization' will be meaningful to modelers/forecasters but not universally.
<br />
<br />My first desire was to generalize the term (e.g., 'how many entities are in a collection of that type of entity'), but I suspect that will be annoying to the primary users. So can we make it specific and say
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a model or operational forecast, the number of member realizations within a given ensemble. This provides context for any specific realization, for example orienting a member relative to its original group (even if the group is no longer intact).
<br />
Or else, define what we mean by 'realization' and 'ensemble'.
<br />
<br />Reviewing this and going back to your original request, there is still a likely point of confusion for users -- it isn't obvious that &quot;given ensemble&quot; refers not to the currently constituted collection, but to the one originally created with this realization.
<br />
<br />In my use case, the whole ensemble is not present, I only have a subset of the members. I have a metadata element telling me how many members there were at the time the ensemble was created, which I would like to encode.
<br />
<br />If you want that to be the use case for this standard_name (for everyone), I think 'within a given ensemble' needs to explicitly say something like 'within its originally created ensemble'. And perhaps the standard name itself should follow that thought, something like 'initial_number_of_realizations'.
<br />
<br />John

<br />Dear Mark
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please may people raise any further concerns about a new standard name:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   number_of_realizations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a canonical unit of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   ''
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and a description of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   The number of member realizations within a given ensemble.
</em><br />
<br />My concern is probably the same one as before. Sorry about that. Does this
<br />
mean the number of members the ensemble has got? If it does, why does it differ
<br />
from the ensemble dimension? If the ensemble dimension has been collapsed to
<br />
size 1, we could record this in cell_methods. Maybe you are dealing with an
<br />
intermediate case, having a subset of the ensemble members, and you want to
<br />
record how many there originally were in total. Is this a common use case?
<br />
It seems rather surprising to me. But I'm not sure that's what you mean.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This name enables a single member from an ensemble to explicitly be labelled, e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   seven_of_nine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is often required in operational forecasting.
</em><br />
<br />But this seems different. It's not the number of members there are, but the
<br />
ordinal number (7) of this particular member. Why can't that be recorded in a
<br />
variable with the existing standard_name of realization?
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
