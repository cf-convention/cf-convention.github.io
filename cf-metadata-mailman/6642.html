Interesting points Martin
<br />
<br />1) I like this, I would support an explicit
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;units = &quot;None&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to address this issue
<br />
<br />2) I agree with this, I woudl like to see units mandatory, with an option for None, as above
<br />
<br />3) I think '' is a functional alternative to None, but it reads poorly
<br />
<br />4) I believe this is accepted, and used.  You can define a unit of 'kg kg-1' and udunits works with it, representing it's definition as '1' to support operations.  So., I think &quot;kg/kg&quot; and &quot;mole/mole&quot; are already accepted
<br />
<br />all the best

<br />
<br />Dear Mark and all,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanks for this discussion and the motion to approach udunits to advance this issue. Reading through the posts on this, I have two comments, one question, and one afterthought:
<br />
<br />1. Why &quot;no_unit&quot; and not simply &quot;none&quot;? &quot;no_unit&quot; could also be &quot;no_units&quot; (in fact the attribute name is unit*s*, so the missing &quot;s&quot; in &quot;no_unit&quot; may be confusing). Being a Python fan, I like Python's concept of None as a value that indicates that there is no value; just what we want here.
<br />
<br />2. When you revise the respective section of the CF convention: in light of the &quot;CF 2&quot; discussions we should think about making the units attribute mandatory. Alternatively, I would suggest that a missing units attribute should mean &quot;none&quot; rather than &quot;1&quot; and/or the units attribute should become mandatory for numerical fields (a string array, for example of station names, may indeed not require a units attribute).
<br />
<br />3. Would you regard &quot;&quot; (empty string) as a valid alternative to &quot;none&quot;?   [I may have overlooked this in the previous discussions but wasn't sure if there was a consensus view]
<br />
<br />4. Coming back to the old &quot;kg/kg&quot; or &quot;mole/mole&quot; discussion: I guess it would help if udunits would accept &quot;terms that evaluate as '1' &quot; with the understanding that they ae equivalent to &quot;1&quot; as unit. Many (most) atmospheric chemistry modelers are still operating in the grey zone with units attributes of &quot;nmole mole-1&quot; which are a lot more readable than &quot;1.e-9&quot; and make a lot of sense to them. Only if you enforce a CF checker on them they will abide, but keep grunting. If one doesn't want to be too generic here, at least &quot;kg/kg&quot; and &quot;mole/mole&quot; should be added to the udunits collection.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Martin

<br />Hello Jim
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A variable with no units attribute at all is also pretty unambiguously a marker for something that isn't intended to be a even a pure number.
</em><br />
<br />If only this were the case.  CF conventions state that:
<br />
Units are not required for dimensionless quantities. A variable with no units attribute is assumed to be dimensionless. However, a units attribute specifying a dimensionless unit may optionally be included.
<br />
<a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#units">http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#units</a>
<br />
<br />Thus, the absence of a unit is to be interpreted identically to a statement that units = '1'
<br />
<br />This is the current situation and it is likely that there is lots of data like this around.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do we really need something more than a disambiguation of units = '1' vs no units attribute present?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think we do: this situation is not ambiguous in CF, they are the same thing.
<br />
<br />What I believe we require is a udunits entity which is clearly 'there is no unit of measure here, this is not dimensioned and not dimensionless'
<br />
<br />The udunits value
<br />
''
<br />
delivers this functionality (I think), but it does not read very well, hence my suggestion that we ask for a new entry in udunits, 'no_unit'
<br />
which is hopefully clear in its meaning and interpretation and which behaves the same as '' : failing all udunits processing attempts and operating as 'not a unit'
<br />
<br />all the best
<br />

<br />
<br />Mark,
<br />
<br />I'm not clear on what you are suggesting that udunits do with 'no_unit' or '?'.
<br />
<br />I had thought that the desire was to be able to differentiate between a pure number (as you mention below) and a value (whether a string or a bit pattern) that should not be interpreted as any number at all.
<br />
<br />As the situation stands, a units value of '1' is pretty unambiguously a marker for a pure number. We may need to modify docs to make this clearer, but I don't think that poses a problem. A variable with no units attribute at all is also pretty unambiguously a marker for something that isn't intended to be a even a pure number. Again, we may need to modify docs to make this clearer. Because these two concepts are somewhat conflated in the current documentation and usage (area_type being an example), there is the issue of other places where cleanup would be good going forward, but even if you have a units value of '1' on a non-number, it doesn't hurt anything in practice.
<br />
<br />Do we really need something more than a disambiguation of units = '1' vs no units attribute present?
<br />
<br />Grace and peace,
<br />
<br />Jim

Thank you for all the responses, it sounds like 'all of the above' is the preferred response to my suggestions of plausible next steps.  I will pursue all of these.
<br />
<br />Eizi's point about having no_unit in udunits is sound; I suggest we request udunits use
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'no_unit'
<br />
as a representation of
<br />
'?'
<br />
such that the behaviour is consistent; 'no_unit' should always raise an exception when used in the udunits processing rules, exactly as '?' does.
<br />
<br />With regard to meaning, I have found the wikipedia entry useful:
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity</a>
<br />
`In dimensional analysis&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis</a>&gt;, a dimensionless quantity or quantity of dimension one is a quantity&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity</a>&gt; without an associated physical dimension&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis</a>&gt;. It is thus a &quot;pure&quot; number, and as such always has a dimension of 1.[1]&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity#cite_note-1">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity#cite_note-1</a>&gt;'
<br />
which it has sourced from
<br />
&quot;1.8 (1.6) quantity of dimension one dimensionless quantity&quot;&lt;<a href="http://www.iso.org/sites/JCGM/VIM/JCGM_200e_FILES/MAIN_JCGM_200e/01_e.html#L_1_8">http://www.iso.org/sites/JCGM/VIM/JCGM_200e_FILES/MAIN_JCGM_200e/01_e.html#L_1_8</a>&gt;.

Retrieved 2011-03-22.
<br />
<br />This is a good enough source for me.
<br />
<br />I will wait to give space for more comments, then,  if people are content, I will raise a change request with udunits.
<br />
Assuming this is accepted and processed I will raise a change request for CF to add some text to 3.1.
<br />
Finally I will request a change for any standard_names which appear not to follow this approach (I have only 'area_type' so far).
<br />
<br />I hope this seems like a reasonable response.
