Dear John, Seth and all.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seems at odds with Seth's observations about when changes appear to go away (with each new release).
</em><br />
<br />I haven't checked what the documents show, but the intention is that all
<br />
changes should still be provisional. I think that's Jeff's understanding too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm pretty sure the intent was also to validate the changes -- i.e., that they were not considered fully approved until they had been around long enough to inspire confidence based on use.
</em><br />
<br />That's right. The rules say that two applications must have demonstrated that
<br />
they work. See <a href="http://cfconventions.org/rules.html">http://cfconventions.org/rules.html</a>. However we have never
<br />
organised this process so it's never happened. I agree that's unsatisfactory.
<br />
Although this thread is about document markup, it's a good time to review the
<br />
rules in this regard. In fact I think we discussed it before, a few months ago.
<br />
<br />During the whole time CF has existed, we have never needed to reverse a change
<br />
because it turned out to be erroneous or problematic. I suppose this is because
<br />
we are always thorough in agreeing them in the first place. However it is still
<br />
sensible to have some provisional period, just in case, and perhaps we can
<br />
presume that if there is a problem, someone will raise it, rather than having
<br />
to set in place a verification process. I presume we should stick to releases
<br />
of the doc. We could update it continually with trac tickets but I think that
<br />
would be more difficult for users of the convention to keep track of. 
<br />
<br />Bearing all that in mind, my initial suggestion would be that a change is
<br />
marked as provisional in the version in which it is first made and any
<br />
subsequent versions which are released less than a year after the change is
<br />
first made. This will mean checking the history to see which provisional
<br />
changes become permanent whenever a new version is compiled, and that's a bit
<br />
of work. Since it's more than a year since we last had a new version, that
<br />
would means all changes that have previously been made would be permanent in
<br />
1.7. The only provisional changes would be those newly made in 1.7.
<br />
<br />Changing the rules is something that the conventions committee would have to
<br />
decide about, but it'd be good if we can agree something on this email list.
<br />
What do you think?
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
