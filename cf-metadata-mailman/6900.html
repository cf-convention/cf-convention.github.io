Dear Jim
<br />
<br />I agree that TAI and GPS aren't distinct CF calendars if they differ only
<br />
because of the epoch. In CF and udunits, the reference time is part of the
<br />
the units, as you know; it's not a property of the calendar. I referred to
<br />
GPS calendar just to contrast it with UTC.
<br />
<br />Unlike you, I don't live only in the real world. :-) Many models use the
<br />
default CF calendar (called standard or gregorian) as an approximation to
<br />
the real world. In these models there are no leap seconds, and it would not
<br />
be correct to call this UTC, or to include the leap seconds in the encoding
<br />
and decoding of time cooordinates. In any case, as we understand, most software
<br />
doesn't allow for leap seconds. For those two reasons, I propose that we
<br />
more precisely define the default (standard, gregorian) calendar to say
<br />
explicitly that it does not include leap seconds i.e. every day is 86400 s
<br />
long exactly. This is probably correct for most of the data which has been
<br />
written with this calendar.
<br />
<br />I call UTC a calendar because it affects the encoding, since it implies leap
<br />
seconds.  You suggest, I think, that the treatment of leap seconds should be
<br />
indicated in the reference time in the units string. This doesn't seem quite
<br />
right to me because the units doesn't say anything about the encoding. We
<br />
use the same format of units string for all calendars. udunits does mention
<br />
UTC in respect of the format of this string because of wanting to talk about
<br />
time zones, not because of leap seconds. Time zones could be used in models
<br />
too (though I don't know of a case). Hence I still propose that we should
<br />
regard UTC as a calendar, if it's correct that the leap seconds in use in the
<br />
real world are part of the definition of UTC. This means we should define a
<br />
a new calendar, which is not the default, in which time units have just the
<br />
same format as usual i.e. udunits, but the encoding and decoding of values
<br />
is done including leap seconds according to UTC. The same value, with the
<br />
same units string, may translate into a different date-time (by a number of
<br />
seconds) according to whether the calendar is default (standard, gregorian)
<br />
or utc. It wouldn't make sense to use this calendar for dates before the
<br />
introduction of UTC, so it should be illegal to do so. We could do this by
<br />
prohibiting reference times earlier than the start of UTC and negative values
<br />
of time in this calendar.
<br />
<br />Maybe I haven't grasped your point properly?
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan

<br />Jonathan,
<br />
<br />I see where you are coming from, and there's validity in that line
<br />
of thought. Leap seconds represent a finer-grained adjustment to the
<br />
overall date/time system being used. I still think it makes good
<br />
sense to add a new attribute to declare whether or not leap second
<br />
handling was used or strengthen our standards for time variables so
<br />
that problems are averted.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a human understandability perspective, a calendar attribute of
</em><br />
&quot;GPS&quot; or &quot;UTC&quot; will be somewhat confusing. In my experience, people
<br />
don't speak of the UTC calendar, it's UTC time. Further, TAI and GPS
<br />
time don't really concern themselves with anything but counts of
<br />
seconds since an epoch date &amp; time. People convert the counts to
<br />
time stamps for convenience, but they are actually more equivalent
<br />
to the Julian Day Number (JDN) than they are to the Gregorian or
<br />
Julian calendar. TAI and GPS time have different epochs, and TAI is
<br />
more accurate, but they both are running counts of seconds that
<br />
aren't tied to the motions of the Earth. As a result, I think that
<br />
it's improper to talk about a GPS calendar or TAI calendar.
<br />
<br />What is being exposed by this discussion is the reality that any of
<br />
us (myself included) have often ignored or been unaware of the fact
<br />
that the time calculators (time handling software) we used when
<br />
filling our time variables with elapsed times weren't giving us true
<br />
counts of seconds since the epochs we wrote into our units
<br />
attributes. If you are working at a resolution of days or hours,
<br />
this will probably never cause a problem. If you are working at a
<br />
resolution of minutes or less and working over a time span of
<br />
greater than two years, it may well have caused at least occasional
<br />
small problems. If you are working with full-resolution
<br />
polar-orbiting satellite data, one second represents ~7 km of
<br />
satellite motion, so such errors can produce significant geolocation
<br />
errors.
<br />
<br />A set of elapsed seconds since a Gregorian/UTC epoch that were
<br />
calculated from Gregorian/UTC time stamps without regard for leap
<br />
seconds and which crossed a leap second boundary are not &quot;GPS&quot;
<br />
seconds. Nor are they &quot;UTC&quot; seconds. They are, strictly speaking,
<br />
elapsed times into which one or more step errors have been
<br />
introduced. As I mentioned in a previous email, as long as you use
<br />
the same time calculator to extract time stamps as you did to get
<br />
elapsed times from input time stamps, you won't notice anything. You
<br />
may notice a problem if you are taking differences between elapsed
<br />
times and a leap second boundary gets involved.
<br />
<br />As I've considered all of this more, I'm tending to favor the second
<br />
option I suggested.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also be more strict, and say the epoch time stamp in the units
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute must always be in UTC. The question would then be reduced to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether or not leap seconds were counted into the elapsed times stored
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the time variable. In this case, we could add a &quot;leap_seconds&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute which would have a value of &quot;UTC&quot; if UTC leap seconds were
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counted into the elapsed times, and &quot;none&quot; if not. This would also allow
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for some other system of leap seconds to be used. (I don't know if there
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are others.) For backward compatibility, considering history, the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default value for this attribute would probably be &quot;UTC&quot;.
<br />
<br />Clearly, having epoch time stamps with time zone offsets from UTC,
<br />
as described in the CF conventions, would be OK as well. I'm also
<br />
open to other namings for the new attribute and for its possible
<br />
values. The leap seconds only become an issue in certain rather
<br />
specific instances, so I think that such an attribute, along with a
<br />
bit of discussion in the document, would likely be sufficient to
<br />
warn those people that may find themselves negatively affected by
<br />
improper leap second handling.
<br />
<br />Grace and peace,
<br />
<br />Jim

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I don't think calendars are the right place to encode this. We could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;add a new &quot;time_system&quot; attribute where you would declare whether

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;your time stamps and elapsed times were based on UTC, GPS, TAI, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If we take this route, we should require the elapsed times to encode

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;leap seconds if the time system is UTC, and state that the default
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;time system is UTC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think this is a calendar issue because the calendar is the set of rules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which translate between components of time (YMDhms) and elapsed time (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fixed time units) since the reference time. Your later email seems to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be consistent with that. In the real world, the elapsed interval (expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;e.g. as the number of seconds) between the ref YMDhms and the actual YMDhs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;depends on whether your calendar includes leap seconds (UTC) or not (GPS).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems that GPS is the calendar likely to have been assumed in existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;CF datasets, so it would be logical to say that the default is the real-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world calendar without leap seconds. Have I misunderstood something? If we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regard this as a property of the calendar, we don't need a new attribute.
