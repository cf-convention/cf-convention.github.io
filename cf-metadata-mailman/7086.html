Thanks, Alison.
<br />
<br />Should remote sensing data be called practical salinity, or the 
<br />
less-specific sea surface
<br />
salinity? The definition pretty clearly states that practical salinity 
<br />
is derived from
<br />
conductivity, so I wonder if we need to include anything at all about 
<br />
remote sensing
<br />
data in this definition.  Since I work with in situ data, this doesn't 
<br />
really matter to
<br />
me, except that it does make the definition ... long and slightly confusing.
<br />
<br />Also, I'm a little concerned that the description of the alternate units 
<br />
- the ones we
<br />
don't want people to use - might add confusion. Instead of:
<br />
<br />'Officially S_P is dimensionless so that, while convenient, and while it 
<br />
is common
<br />
practice, it is not officially sanctioned to say S_P = 35 psu. Often 
<br />
authors use PSS-78, as in
<br />
S_P = 35 PSS-78'
<br />
<br />could we just say:
<br />
<br />'Practical Salinity is not a direct measure of salt concentration, rather,
<br />
it is a relative scale calibrated against a standard potassium chloride
<br />
solution, and is therefore non-dimensional (canonical units='1')' ?
<br />
<br />Last, I think all the interspersing of short names is unneeded, so could
<br />
we shorten
<br />
<br />'There are also standard names for the precisely defined salinity 
<br />
quantities sea_water_knudsen_salinity,
<br />
S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), 
<br />
sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used
<br />
for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), 
<br />
sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A,
<br />
sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity'
<br />
<br />to:
<br />
<br />'There are also standard names for the precisely defined salinity quantities
<br />
sea_water_knudsen_salinity, used for salinity observations between 1901 
<br />
and 1966,
<br />
sea_water_cox_salinity,  used for salinity observations between 1967 and 
<br />
1977,
<br />
sea_water_absolute_salinity, sea_water_preformed_salinity,  and 
<br />
sea_water_reference_salinity. '
<br />
<br />Here's what I came up with using (mostly just) those changes
<br />
<br />Practical Salinity is defined on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 
<br />
(PSS-78)
<br />
and is calculated from the electrical conductivity of sea water (as well 
<br />
as temperature
<br />
and pressure). Practical Salinity is not a direct measure of salt 
<br />
concentration,
<br />
rather, it is a relative scale calibrated against a standard potassium 
<br />
chloride
<br />
solution containing 32.4356 g kg-1 of KCl whose conductivity is measured 
<br />
at 15
<br />
degrees Celsius. If salinity is measured using remote sensing techniques 
<br />
and not conductivity,
<br />
then it is recommended that additional metadata (calibration/validation 
<br />
information)
<br />
be described in the variable comment attribute. This name should not be 
<br />
used to describe
<br />
salinity observations made before 1978, or ones not based on 
<br />
conductivity measurements.
<br />
<br />There are also standard names for the precisely defined salinity quantities
<br />
sea_water_knudsen_salinity,used for salinity observations between 1901 
<br />
and 1966
<br />
sea_water_cox_salinity,  used for salinity observations between 1967 and 
<br />
1977,
<br />
sea_water_absolute_salinity, sea_water_preformed_salinity,  and 
<br />
sea_water_reference_salinity.
<br />
Salinity quantities that do not match any of the precise definitions 
<br />
should be
<br />
given the more general standard name of sea_water_salinity. Reference:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suggest we change this to the following (note the addition of the 4th - 6th sentences):

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This definition is turning into something of an essay, but I think that is preferable to continued confusion about the meaning of the quantity or the interpretation of its units. Does it fit the bill? (The scale_factor attribute, mentioned in an earlier post, is defined solely for the purpose of data packing and should not be used to indicate the scaling of units, e.g. interpreting 0.001 as meaning 1.) Also, is the GSW Toolbox a software library? Is there a reference to it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any names that mention absolute_salinity, preformed_salinity or reference_salinity will definitely keep their units of g kg-1. All these names were added as the result of a long discussion of TEOS-10 quantities and it was very carefully specified what their units should be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Roy's enquiry to the TEOS-10 group also indicates that the quantities sea_water_cox_salinity and sea_water_knudsen_salinity should keep their units of 0.001. Indeed, their definitions already specify that they should be expressed as  'unitless as a mass fraction per mil (0/00) or &quot;parts per thousand&quot; ' so it is very clear how to interpret them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rich, Craig and Roy discussed sea_surface_salinity. At the moment this is a generic name and not tied to any precise definition of salinity. (The standard name definition makes a statement to that effect). The question was raised as to whether sea_surface_salinity should be regarded as Practical Salinity: the answer appears to be definitely &quot;no&quot;. There is therefore no proposal to change the units of this quantity at present so it will remain as 0.001. The definition will also remain unchanged.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Other generic salinity names (nine in total) including sea_ice_salinity and sea_water_salinity also currently have units of 0.001. As with sea_surface_salinity I don't think there is actually a specific proposal to change them so we should leave the units alone. As Jonathan has pointed out, these generic quantities are particularly useful for model data and I don't think that we should be trying to tie them down any more precisely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what this now boils down to is that we are only discussing changes to the canonical units of sea_water_practical_salinity and the accompanying definition. If we can agree the definition text then I think the change can be accepted for publication in the standard name table.
