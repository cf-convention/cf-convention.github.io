<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Jim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I appreciate your willingness to continue this attempt to find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meeting of the minds about all of this. I hope you will forgive me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if I am not always completely clear in my attempts to express myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or fail to understand you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say exactly the same to you! Thanks. Actually I'm struggling to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand what we are disagreeing about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As a data consumer, all I have to do is convert the reference time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from the stated calendar to my desired calender, then use that as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the basis for producing timestamps from the elapsed times in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; variable (using the correct set of time functions, of course).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Expressing the elapsed times as timestamps in one calendar and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; converting those timestamps to another is another way that you could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do it, but one which adds unneeded steps.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In both our views, decoding the time coord (into components of time, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will refer to as &quot;timestamps&quot; for convenience although we would probably not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use strings for this purpose, since usually we want numbers) according to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar stated by the attribute requires using the algorithm appropriate for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the calendar. This algorithm is one which can add an offset to the reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; timestamp using the rules of the calendar to produce new timestamps, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reverse. Hence the calendar attribute implies particular rules for encoding and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decoding. But that is the statement of mine which you disagree with, I think -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't it?
</em><br />
I agree with what you said above up until your last sentence. The 
<br />
definition of a calendar includes (by implication) the rules for how to 
<br />
convert between an elapsed time count since a reference epoch and a 
<br />
timestamp as expressed in that calendar. I don't see the calendar 
<br />
attribute as implying a particular set of rules to follow for the entire 
<br />
contents of a time variable (see below).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that the calendar attribute also states the calendar in which the ref
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time is expressed - this second function is one I have recognised because of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our discussion (it is obvious in the case of model calendars, so I didn't see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it as a distinct function). Since the att states the calendar of the ref time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and implies the rules for encoding and decoding, it therefore also inevitably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implies the calendar of the decoded timestamps, doesn't it?
</em><br />
This is where we start diverging more significantly. As I see it, the 
<br />
calendar attribute specifies &quot;the calendar in which the ref time is 
<br />
expressed&quot;, and nothing more.  If the data producer has done her job 
<br />
correctly the elapsed time values are metric measures relative to an 
<br />
epoch point in the units (seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc) specified 
<br />
in the units attribute, and are calendar neutral. I might have started 
<br />
with timestamps in the calendar named in the calendar attribute, but I 
<br />
might also have started with a start timestamp and stopwatch readings. 
<br />
My start timestamp might not have been in the calendar that I named in 
<br />
the calendar attribute, but as long as I converted the timestamp from 
<br />
the original calendar to the one named in the calendar attribute, it 
<br />
doesn't matter. This assumes, of course, that such a conversion is 
<br />
possible, as I mentioned in my last email.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that you could change to a new calendar in the real world by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculating the difference in seconds between the ref time if it's interpreted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the old calendar and if it's interpreted in the new calendar (or a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ref time if you want to change the ref time as well as the calendar) and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adjusting the time coordinates by this amount (and the ref time in the units
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string if you want to change that as well). I think that will be the same as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what I suggested, which is to decode the coords using the old calendar and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ref time, then encode them using the new calendar and ref time. Perhaps my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; method sounds like more calculation, but it might be easier to carry out (just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two subroutine calls). I think these methods are equivalent, aren't they?
</em><br />
Assuming that you can change to the new calendar, all you have to do is 
<br />
make one call to a function that converts a timestamp from one calendar 
<br />
to another, then use the converted timestamp in your decoding function 
<br />
appropriate to the new calendar. There are a variety of ways to go about 
<br />
it, but the point is that the necessary and sufficient condition for the 
<br />
change is converting the reference timestamp from the one calendar to 
<br />
the other. If a valid conversion exists, and if you do it the one time, 
<br />
no other reference to the calendar named in the attribute is required.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They work because, as we agree, the encoded time coord is also an elapsed time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and is useful as such. The only situation in which it might have small dis-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuities is if the no-leap-second algorithm is used to encode and decode
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UTC and, as we have agreed, there should be a clear warning against not doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that if precision &lt;1 min is required.
</em><br />
Correct. This amounts to an error on the part of the data producer or 
<br />
time measurer. Actually, half correct. If the wrong algorithm was used 
<br />
to encode (create the elapsed times), then the contents of the time 
<br />
variable potentially contain discontinuities and/or offsets (as we have 
<br />
covered in previous emails). If the data consumer manages to decode 
<br />
using the inverse algorithm to the one used by the data producer, then 
<br />
you won't see the errors in the timestamps produced.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reason that I regard timestamps as primary, and therefore suggest that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would go via timestamps to change the calendar, is because of the non-real-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world calendars that are the subject of other emails. Although, as you rightly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say, there is no exact way to draw an equivalence between the real-world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the various non-real-world calendars (360_day, no_leap, etc.), we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; draw such an equivalence for model-model and model-obs comparisons. The main
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purpose of CF is to clarify when and how data is to be regarded as comparable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it's a common need to compare climate data in different calendars. When
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is done, it's the timestamps which are comparable. DJF (season) is DJF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (including all of Dec, Jan and Feb) whichever calendar is used, even though it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has different lengths in those calendars. Therefore it is the timestamps which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truly define the ranges of time, not the relative time coordinates.
</em><br />
In truth, the time in a non-real-world calendar is not comparable to 
<br />
time in a real-world calendar. There is no conversion path. You 
<br />
certainly are free to match timestamps when doing comparisons between 
<br />
model data and observations. But there is no conversion between 
<br />
calendars going on when you do that. You are making a calculated 
<br />
decision to compare quinces and apples, being fully aware of why you are 
<br />
doing it.
<br />
<br />Matching timestamps without conversion is exactly what you would *not* 
<br />
want to do when comparing observations recorded using two different 
<br />
real-world calendars. If one set of timestamps used the Julian calendar, 
<br />
and the other used the Gregorian calendar, you would not want to compare 
<br />
the observations for April 1, 2015 in both calendars. In this case, you 
<br />
either convert one set of times from one calendar to the other, or find 
<br />
the offset between the reference timestamps. Once you have the offset, 
<br />
you could compare observations based on undecoded elapsed times if you 
<br />
wanted to.
<br />
<br />So, as I see it, timestamps are not primary. The reference timestamps 
<br />
defined by their calendars and the metric elapsed times are primary. If 
<br />
you have these and a conversion exists between two calendars, you have 
<br />
all you need to do it. If no conversion exists you must resort to some 
<br />
form of approximation, but that's your business as a data consumer.
<br />
