Dear Jim
<br />
<br />It appears that we have some irreconcilable differences in interpretation but
<br />
I am not sure that they make any difference in practice, which is fortunate
<br />
if correct.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The definition of a calendar includes (by implication) the rules for how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to convert between an elapsed time count since a reference epoch and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a timestamp as expressed in that calendar.
</em><br />
Yes. The elapsed time count is the time coordinate. That's what I mean by the
<br />
rules for encoding and decoding. In addition, the calendar attribute states
<br />
the calendar of the reference time. (I can't understand why taking these
<br />
together doesn't mean that the attribute implies the calendar of the decoded
<br />
timestamps too, but I don't mind if we don't say that! I've always assumed
<br />
that the calendar is regarded as a property of the time coordinate construct
<br />
as a whole, because it's an attribute of the time coordinate variable.)
<br />
<br />Yes, I agree that you can change the calendar without modifying the time
<br />
coordinate values if you instead alter the reference time so that it refers
<br />
to the same instant of real time in the new calendar. (I was considering the
<br />
case when you wished to keep the same reference time, say 1st Jan 2015, but
<br />
alter the calendar. In that case you have to add an offset to the coordinate
<br />
values, which can be done be decoding and reencoding or by other means, but
<br />
the method used isn't material to the definition, so there is no need to say
<br />
how this is done.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Matching timestamps without conversion is exactly what you would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *not* want to do when comparing observations recorded using two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different real-world calendars.
</em><br />
That is true. But it is exactly what you do want to do when comparing real-
<br />
world and model calendars, or different model calendars, which is the common
<br />
case for a lot of CF data. In that common case, the timestamps are primary.
<br />
For example, climatological means, for which we have a CF conversion, assume
<br />
that users want to deal with time in a timestamp-based way, in which months
<br />
are equivalent regardless of calendar. It is inexact in a sense, but it's what
<br />
we need to do. More generally, you could argue that CF is quite a lot concerned
<br />
with the general problem of comparing apples and quinces. CF provides metadata
<br />
which enables users to indicate that the comparison is valid, by giving the
<br />
two things the same label.
<br />
<br />I don't think the question of whether timestamps are primary makes a material
<br />
difference to the convention or its use. It would be fine to state that the
<br />
encoded time coordinate is an elapsed time and has no discontinuities, except
<br />
for small ones in the case of using the no-leap-second calendar to encode UTC
<br />
time. I think we have to support this case because it is almost certainly in
<br />
use, perhaps widespread use, and it's better to be explicit about it. CF does
<br />
not generally try to tell people what to do, but to enable them to describe
<br />
clearly what they have done.
<br />
<br />I agree that seconds are always the same length. If only days were too! (But
<br />
they are in udunits, so we could warn against using days as a unit of time
<br />
in calendar=&quot;gregorian_utc&quot; because it could be confusing, although encoding
<br />
and decoding would work correctly.)
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
