Dear Karl
<br />
<br />Thanks for your contributions. The points you are raising are similar to those
<br />
which Jim and I have been debating for some time, gradually moving towards
<br />
mutual understanding! I think the position we had got to is quite economical.
<br />
Let me try to relate it to what you suggest.
<br />
<br />Your main suggestion is to allow UTC or GPS to be stated in the time units,
<br />
whereas Jim and I have been discussing putting it in the calendar attribute.
<br />
The latter is what I prefer because it seems to me that the distinction between
<br />
UTC and GPS is quite like the differences among all the model calendars, and
<br />
with the real-world calendar. The calendar attribute indicates two things:
<br />
<br />* The calendar (or time system) in which the reference time is stated.
<br />
<br />* The algorithms which should be used to decode the time coordinates into
<br />
timestamps in the calendar of the reference time, and to encode timestamps in
<br />
that calendar to time coordinates with the given reference time.
<br />
<br />These points distinguish UTC and GPS times, and they similarly distinguish
<br />
UTC from 360-day-calendar times, for instance. So it's a more uniform approach
<br />
to use the calendar attribute in all cases. Also, parsing the time units att
<br />
is less convenient than inspecting the calendar att, which is a single word
<br />
with only a small number of possible values.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) CF not try to accommodate folks using &quot;wrong&quot; software.
</em><br />
<br />The case in point is using software without leap seconds to encode UTC
<br />
timestamps. I think it's too harsh to call it &quot;wrong&quot;. It pretends that UTC
<br />
is something slightly different and other-worldly, and that makes its elapsed
<br />
times a bit inaccurate. But it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do. As I
<br />
said in a recent email, I expect that many or most climate and NWP models,
<br />
when using the &quot;real-world&quot; calendar to deal with real-world weather and
<br />
climate (assimilating and comparing with real-world obs), have time coords
<br />
which are encoded from UTC timestamps but not using leap seconds i.e. &quot;wrong&quot;.
<br />
This seems sensible to me since they certainly don't depend on precision to
<br />
within a few seconds, and it's easier. So why not? It's not the job of CF to
<br />
tell people what to do, and we should accommodate it so long as it's well-
<br />
defined and has a use-case.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) we relax our requirement that udunits be able to handle the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordinate because it won't recognize and interpret &quot;UTC&quot; and &quot;GPS&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />udunits can't handle model calendars anyway. We use udunits only to define
<br />
the format of the time units, not to depend on it for decoding and encoding.
<br />
<br />There is also a use-case for real-world times where the data-producer is not
<br />
precise about whether the ref time is UTC or GPS, or whether the coords were
<br />
encoded with leap seconds. It seems that we should distinguish this case from
<br />
the precise and deliberate use of 86400-second days for UTC. I think this is
<br />
a rather specific case of imprecision, not the same as inaccuracy in coord
<br />
values in general (for which we don't have a convention at present - no-one's
<br />
asked for one yet), and that it relates specifically to the calendar. So I
<br />
still prefer the proposal we've already arrived at for four values of the
<br />
calendar att for the real world:
<br />
<br />gregorian: Not specifying whether it's GPS or UTC or how encoded. Elapsed
<br />
times and decoded coords are therefore imprecise.
<br />
<br />gregorian_nls: UTC ref time and time coords encoded from UTC timestamps without
<br />
leap seconds, which are inaccurate elapsed time, but can be decoded accurately.
<br />
<br />gregorian_utc: UTC ref time, time coords are elapsed time, decoding to UTC
<br />
timestamps if UTC algorithm is used.
<br />
<br />gregorian_gps: GPS ref time, time coords are elapsed time, decoding to GPS
<br />
timestamps if GPS algorithm is used (which is actually the same algorithm
<br />
as for gregorian_nls i.e. 86400-second days).
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
