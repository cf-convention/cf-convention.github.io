Dear Michael and John,
<br />
<br />(I?ve added ?GOES-R? to the subject line of this thread, just to make the context clear).
<br />
<br />Thank you both for your comments on this name. I think the clarification to the definition and the inclusion of the reference are very useful. I?m happy not to include the sentence about strings in the definition. I?ll send a separate post regarding string valued standard names shortly (it won?t have any new implications for this name).
<br />
<br />This name is now accepted for publication in the standard name table and will be part of the update on July 8.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />
Alison

<br />Like it with the ATCF  references, thank you.
<br />
<br />I think the parenthetical about ?A string type variable should not normally have a ?units? attribute.? is unnecessary, can we delete it?

automated_tropical_cyclone_forecasting_system_storm_identifier (canonical units: 1) ' Definition:
<br />
Contains an 8 character string, BBCCYYYY which identifies a tropical cyclone. A string type variable should not normally have a &quot;units&quot; attribute.
<br />
BB is the ocean basin, specifically:
<br />
AL - North Atlantic basin; north of the Equator SL - South Atlantic basin; south of the Equator EP - North East Pacific basin; eastward of 140 degrees west longitude CP - North Central Pacific basin; between the dateline and 140 degrees west longitude WP -North West Pacific basin; westward of the dateline IO - North Indian Ocean basin; north of the Equator between 40 and 100 degrees east longitude SH - South Pacific Ocean basin and South Indian Ocean basin  CC is the cyclone number.
<br />
Numbers 01 through 49 are reserved for tropical and subtropical cyclones. A cyclone number is assigned to each tropical or subtropical cyclone in each basin as it develops. Numbers are assigned in chronological order.   Numbers 50 through 79 are reserved for internal use by operational forecast centers.   Numbers 80 through 89 are reserved for training, exercises and testing.  Numbers 90 through 99 are reserved for tropical disturbances having the potential to become tropical or subtropical cyclones.  The 90's are assigned sequentially and reused throughout the calendar year.
<br />
YYYY is the four-digit year
<br />
Calendar year for the northern hemisphere.  For the southern hemisphere, the year begins July 1, with calendar year plus one.'

<br />
<br />No comments were received on this name following the original proposal. We have existing standard names for string valued variables such as region, area_type, platform_name and sensor_band_identifier. The values of the first two are standardised while the second two are not. The proposed name would be another example of a standardised string valued variable and the possible values are described in the definition, so that is fine. A string type variable should not normally have a &quot;units&quot; attribute so the canonical units should be left blank. (I've added a sentence to the definition regarding units).  As for the name itself, is there only one &quot;automated tropical cyclone forecasting system&quot; in existence? I.e. is  the naming convention referred to in this name universally recognised or are there any &quot;competitor&quot; names that could be assigned to the same cyclone by a different forecasting system?
<br />
<br />Reply by Michael Carlomusto on 3 July 2015:
<br />
<br />To answer Alison?s questions ?
<br />
1)  There is only one Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF) which was first defined in an American Meteorological Society journal -
<br />
Miller, R.J., Schrader, A.J., Sampson, C.R., &amp; Tsui, T.L. (1990). The Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF), Computer Techniques, 5, 653?660.
<br />
2)  There are many tropical cyclone naming conventions, both current and deprecated, but only one ?ATCF? storm identifier.
<br />
<br /><br />I would like to submit the following revised proposal (Alison ? please edit/delete the canonical units according to the convention. I literally just left it blank.  Thanks):
<br />
<br />automated_tropical_cyclone_forecasting_system_storm_identifier (canonical units: ) ' Definition:
<br />
The Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF) storm identifier is an 8 character string which identifies a tropical cyclone. A string type variable should not normally have a &quot;units&quot; attribute. The storm identifier has the form BBCCYYYY, where
