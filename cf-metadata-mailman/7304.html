Hi Nan and Maarten,
<br />
<br />Maarten is correct that my definition was considering only reflection from a plane surface (a better term than my (&quot;reference surface&quot;). My definition was from the perspective of satellite-based remote sensing of a plane target, usually horizontal, such as surface, cloud-top or top of atmosphere. I agree with Maarten that it would be better to allow more general geometries.
<br />
<br />I think the following two issues need to be considered, although I'm not firmly committed to a resolution for either:
<br />
<br /><br />1)      Should the definition of albedo be restricted to shortwave? The upwelling longwave at the surface includes a component that is atmospheric emission that began as downwelling and was reflected by the surface. However, I have most often seen the equations describing the longwave fluxes at the Earth's surface refer to the fraction of flux reflected as (1 - emissivity) rather than albedo. Because this reflected longwave exists, I think that if we agree to restrict the definition of albedo to shortwave then &quot;shortwave&quot; should be explicitly included in the definition. I would be comfortable restricting the definition of albedo to shortwave.
<br />
<br /><br />2)      Do we need to distinguish reflection from transmission? If we do, then it is probably necessary to include &quot;reflected&quot; in the definition as Nan suggests. In the restricted case of reflection from a surface, the distinction can be made, as I did, by stating that the outgoing radiation is towards the hemisphere from which the radiation was incident. My experience is largely with plane surfaces. But for a sphere or Maarten's aerosol particle both incident and reflected radiation can be from / to the full 4 pi of directions. Are there cases like that in which it is not clear or not sensible to distinguish reflection from transmission? Perhaps it makes sense to distinguish reflection from transmission for a plane (such as a leaf or an optical filter) but not a small particle (such as when defining the aerosol single scattering albedo). I'd welcome Maarten's or anyone else's thoughts.
<br />
<br />Another option that cuts across both these issues would be to include &quot;reflected&quot; but omit &quot;shortwave&quot; to accommodate reflected thermal emission.
<br />
<br />I suggest we are converging to:
<br />
&quot;Albedo is the ratio of (exiting|outgoing|reflected) [shortwave] radiant flux to incident [shortwave] radiant flux&quot;
<br />
where we must choose one of the words in the parentheses () and choose whether to  include &quot;shortwave&quot; in [].
<br />
<br />My inclination is towards:
<br />
&quot;Albedo is the ratio of reflected shortwave radiant flux to incident shortwave radiant flux&quot;
<br />
to exclude thermal radiation and exclude transmission in those cases where transmission makes sense.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Ian
