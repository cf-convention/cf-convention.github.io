<br />
Hi,
<br />
<br />Here are a few requests for new standard_name attribute values. Most of these are 
<br />
variants of existing names, new species for constructs that already exist, some will 
<br />
require more iterations.
<br />
<br />In the second half I've put a reminder for some names I've submitted before, but have 
<br />
not been included at this moment. The last item is an interpretation question.
<br />
<br /><br />height_at_center_of_aerosol_layer:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Height is the vertical distance above the surface. The center corresponds to the 
<br />
height corresponding to the mean air pressure of the top and bottom of the layer 
<br />
containing aerosol particles.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: m
<br />
<br />air_pressure_at_center_of_aerosol_layer:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Air pressure is not specified further within the CF standard name table). The 
<br />
center corresponds to the mean air pressure of the top and bottom of the layer 
<br />
containing aerosol particles.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: Pa
<br />
<br />dry_atmosphere_mole_fraction_of_methane
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mole fraction is used in the construction &quot;mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is 
<br />
a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a 
<br />
single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The 
<br />
construction &quot;dry_atmosphere_mole_fraction&quot; means that the quantity refers to the 
<br />
whole atmospheric column and is calculated as the total number of particles of X in 
<br />
the column divided by the number of dry air particles in the same column, i.e. the 
<br />
effect of water vapor is excluded. For localized values within the atmospheric 
<br />
medium, standard names including &quot;in_air&quot; are used. The chemical formula for methane 
<br />
is CH4.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: 1
<br />
<br />atmosphere_mole_content_of_carbon_monoxide:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a 
<br />
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the 
<br />
atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
<br />
names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The construction 
<br />
&quot;atmosphere_mole_content_of_X&quot; means the vertically integrated number of moles of X 
<br />
above a unit area. The chemical formula for carbon monoxide is CO.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: mol m-2
<br />
<br />atmosphere_mole_content_of_water_vapor:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a 
<br />
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the 
<br />
atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
<br />
names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The construction 
<br />
&quot;atmosphere_mole_content_of_X&quot; means the vertically integrated number of moles of X 
<br />
above a unit area. The chemical formula for water vapor is H2O.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: mol m-2
<br />
<br />surface_upwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air_due_to_fluorescence:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. 
<br />
&quot;shortwave&quot; means shortwave radiation. Upwelling radiation is radiation from below. 
<br />
It does not mean &quot;net upward&quot;. When thought of as being incident on a surface, a 
<br />
radiative flux is sometimes called &quot;irradiance&quot;. In addition, it is identical with 
<br />
the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called &quot;vector 
<br />
irradiance&quot;. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; 
<br />
implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a 
<br />
physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a 
<br />
single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by 
<br />
omitting the phrase. The fluorescence is caused by chlorophyll.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: mol s-2 m-2 m-1 sr-1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: do not simplify the unit to mol s-2 m-3 sr-1, the first is a surface 
<br />
area, the second is a radiation wavelength).
<br />
<br />atmosphere_mole_content_of_methane:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a 
<br />
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the 
<br />
atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
<br />
names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The construction 
<br />
&quot;atmosphere_mole_content_of_X&quot; means the vertically integrated number of moles of X 
<br />
above a unit area. The chemical formula for methane is CH4.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: mol m-2
<br />
<br />atmosphere_mole_content_of_semiheavy_water_vapor:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a 
<br />
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the 
<br />
atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
<br />
names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The construction 
<br />
&quot;atmosphere_mole_content_of_X&quot; means the vertically integrated number of moles of X 
<br />
above a unit area. The chemical formula for semiheavy or deuterated water vapor is HDO.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: I use semiheavy_water here to leave room for heavy_water)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: mol m-2
<br />
<br />height_of_cloud_optical_centroid:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud height at optical centriod is a height within the cloud, near the 
<br />
optical thickness center of the cloud. See also: air_pressure_at_cloud_optical_centroid.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: m
<br />
<br />atmosphere_mole_content_of_nitrogen_dioxide:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a 
<br />
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the 
<br />
atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
<br />
names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. The chemical formula for 
<br />
nitrogen_dioxide is NO2.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: mol m-2
<br />
<br />air_temperature_at_150cm:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) 
<br />
temperature. This is the 1.5 m height at which synoptic observations are performed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: oddly enough I coun't find this parameter in the list. I use 150 cm to 
<br />
avoid using a dot in a standard name value).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: K
<br />
<br />air_temperature_at_cloud_optical_centroid:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) 
<br />
temperature. The cloud optical centriod pressure is a pressure level inside the 
<br />
cloud, near the optical thickness center of the cloud. See also: 
<br />
air_pressure_at_cloud_optical_centroid.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: K
<br />
<br />* The following names were submitted before, but do not yet appear in the 
<br />
standard_name table, this serves as a reminder, using the latest reply on the list as 
<br />
a starting point. See the thread with subject &quot;New standard_name values for some 
<br />
cloud and aerosol related variables&quot; started by me on 30 September 2015:
<br />
<br />ultraviolet_aerosol_index:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ultraviolet means ultraviolet radiation, with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. 
<br />
The UV-Aerosol Index is a UV color index that represents the deviation of the 
<br />
outgoing TOA radiation in the UV from that of a standard atmosphere, featuring 
<br />
Rayleigh scattering and gas absorption, in particular by ozone. No cloud droplets or 
<br />
suspended liquid or solid particles (aerosols) are present in the standard 
<br />
atmosphere. It is bounded below by a Lambertian surface, featuring isotropic 
<br />
reflection, assumed independent of wavelength. The ultraviolet aerosol index is 
<br />
computed from the Earth reflectances at two UV wavelengths. A positive deviation from 
<br />
the standard atmosphere is often, but not exclusively, attributed to the absorption 
<br />
of radiation by aerosols, while negative values represent increased scattering, not 
<br />
necessarily by aerosols. The wavelengths used for the computation of the ultraviolet 
<br />
aerosol index should be indicated using a coordinate variable with standard name 
<br />
radiation _wavelength and length 2. This support coordinate variable should be given 
<br />
in the ancillary_variables attribute.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: not the coordinates attribute, as this is an annotation, not a coordinate).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: 1
<br />
<br />air_pressure_at_cloud_optical_centroid:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud optical centriod pressure is a pressure level inside the cloud, near 
<br />
the optical thickness center of the cloud.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: Pa
<br />
<br />effective_cloud_area_fraction_assuming_fixed_cloud_albedo:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;X_area_fraction&quot; means the fraction of horizontal area occupied by X. &quot;X_area&quot; 
<br />
means the horizontal area occupied by X within the grid cell or the satellite 
<br />
footprint. Cloud area fraction is also called &quot;cloud amount&quot; and &quot;cloud cover&quot;. The 
<br />
cloud area fraction is for the whole atmosphere column, as seen from the surface or 
<br />
the top of the atmosphere. Cloud area fraction assuming fixed cloud albedo is the 
<br />
cloud area fraction by assuming the clouds in the X_area having the same fixed cloud 
<br />
albedo value (Y). The clouds having cloud_area_fraction_assuming_fixed_cloud_albedo 
<br />
and cloud albedo Y yield the same reflectance at TOA as the real clouds in the 
<br />
X_area. A phrase assuming_condition indicates that the named quantity is the value 
<br />
which would obtain if all aspects of the system were unaltered except for the 
<br />
assumption of the circumstances specified by the condition. The assumed albedo shall 
<br />
be attached to the variable either by an attribute 'assumed_cloud_albedo' (if the 
<br />
value is independent of geolocation) or through the ancillary_variables to a variable 
<br />
with standard_name 'cloud_albedo'.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: 1
<br />
<br />cloud_albedo_assuming_completely_cloudy_sky
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cloud_albedo_assuming_completely_cloudy_sky means a derived (retrieved) cloud 
<br />
albedo in an area assuming the scene is completely cloud covered (the grid cell or 
<br />
satellite footprint). A phrase assuming_condition indicates that the named quantity 
<br />
is the value which would obtain if all aspects of the system were unaltered except 
<br />
for the assumption of the circumstances specified by the condition.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: 1
<br />
<br />air_pressure_at_cloud_optical_centroid_assuming_completely_cloudy_sky
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud optical centriod pressure is a pressure level inside the cloud, near 
<br />
the optical thickness center of the cloud. 
<br />
air_pressure_at_cloud_optical_centroid_assuming_completely_cloudy_sky means a cloud 
<br />
optical centriod pressure assuming the scene is completely cloud covered (the grid 
<br />
cell or satellite footprint). A phrase assuming_condition indicates that the named 
<br />
quantity is the value which would obtain if all aspects of the system were unaltered 
<br />
except for the assumption of the circumstances specified by the condition.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: Pa
<br />
<br />* The following names are close, but not close enough for our purposes:
<br />
<br />atmosphere_optical_thickness_due_to_ambient_aerosol_particles:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The optical thickness is the integral along the path of radiation of a volume 
<br />
scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient. The radiative flux is reduced by a 
<br />
factor exp(-optical_thickness) on traversing the path. A coordinate variable of 
<br />
radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency can be specified to indicate that the 
<br />
optical thickness applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies. The atmosphere 
<br />
optical thickness applies to radiation passing through the entire atmosphere. 
<br />
&quot;Aerosol&quot; means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except 
<br />
cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. &quot;Ambient_aerosol&quot; means that 
<br />
the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and 
<br />
relative humidity that exists in its immediate environment. &quot;Ambient aerosol 
<br />
particles&quot; are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic 
<br />
growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the 
<br />
composition of the particles. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at 
<br />
which the quantity described by the standard name applies, provide scalar coordinate 
<br />
variables with standard names of &quot;relative_humidity&quot; and &quot;air_temperature&quot;. The 
<br />
specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the 
<br />
quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general 
<br />
quantity named by omitting the phrase.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: The description seems to indicate a slant path, not a vertical path. We 
<br />
need the latter, which also seems to be more appropriate for modellers. Any 
<br />
suggestions for a new name and full description?)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical unit: 1
<br />
<br />Thank you for reading this far.
