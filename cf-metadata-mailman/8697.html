Dear Chris, All,
<br />
<br />I am proposing these standard names on behalf of Chris Jones. They are needed for the CMIP6 C4MIP experiment.
<br />
<br />I am sure that Chris will comment on the names and definitions in due course and other comments and suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Chris, you will see that some of the names have evolved again from the versions in our offlist discussion. This is partly due to the fact that I understand the quantities better now - thank you for providing information for the definitions - and partly because I have modified some of them to be more consistent with existing names. Please have a look through the proposals and let me know if you are happy with them.

<br />
<br />I have changed from writing the isotope name as carbon14 to 14C to be consistent with the large number of  radioactive isotope names that were added to the standard name table last week. In the discussion of those names we agreed to use the chemical symbol for the element and have mixed case standard names whenever we want to describe a particular isotope. The CMIP names should now follow this agreed syntax. This applies to all the 14C and 13C names in proposals 15 - 22.

<br />
<br />I realise this name doesn't look very elegant but there is a reason for writing it in this way! Firstly, this quantity is defined as the sum of all the other 'land' components of 14C, i.e., vegetation + litter + soil + products, and that is explicitly stated in my suggested name. I hesitate to just call it mass_content_of_14C_on_land because we tend to use 'land' in CF as an area type meaning not sea or sea-ice. Also, the way the quantity is defined doesn't include, for example, carbon in bedrock so I think calling it 'land' is a bit too vague and general. We do have a precedent for combining multiple phrases with more than one _and_ in a standard name: tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_elemental_nitrogen_due_to_deposition_and_fixation_and_runoff. Again this is an example of where there didn't seem to be an appropriate succinct term. I'm very open to discussion on this proposal - can anyone think of a better  term than 'land' to summarize the sum of the various components?

' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. &quot;Vegetation&quot; means any living plants e.g. trees, shrubs, grass. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. The &quot;soil content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the soil model. Examples of &quot;forestry and agricultural products&quot; are paper, cardboard, furniture, timber for construction, biofuels and food for both humans and livestock. Models that simulate land use changes have one or more pools of carbon that represent these products in order to conserve carbon and allow its eventual release into the atmosphere, for example, when the products decompose in landfill sites. &quot;C&quot; means the element carbon and &quot;13C&quot; is the stable isotope &quot;carbon-13&quot;, having six protons and seven neutrons.'
<br />
<br />Similar to proposal 18, this quantity is the sum of the various land based carbon budget components for 13C. Again, if we can come up with a more succinct term for the sum of the components we could use it in this name.

soil_mass_content_of_minerals_expressed_as_nitrogen (canonical units: kg m-2)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;soil content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the soil model. For the content between specified levels in the soil, standard names including &quot;content_of_soil_layer&quot; are used. The term &quot;mineral&quot; means a solid, naturally occurring inorganic chemical species. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.'

soil_mass_content_of_ammonium_minerals_expressed_as_nitrogen (canonical units: kg m-2)

' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;soil content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the soil model. For the content between specified levels in the soil, standard names including &quot;content_of_soil_layer&quot; are used. The term &quot;mineral&quot; means a solid, naturally occurring inorganic chemical species. &quot;Ammonium minerals&quot; means mineral compounds containing ammonium. The chemical formula for the ammonium cation is NH4+. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.'

soil_mass_content_of_nitrate_minerals_expressed_as_nitrogen (canonical units: kg m-2)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;soil content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the soil model. For the content between specified levels in the soil, standard names including &quot;content_of_soil_layer&quot; are used. The term &quot;mineral&quot; means a solid, naturally occurring inorganic chemical species. &quot;Nitrate minerals&quot; means mineral compounds containing nitrate. The chemical formula for the nitrate anion is NO3-. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.'

tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_methane_due_to_emission_from_wetland_biological_production (canonical units: kg m-2 s-1)
<br />
' &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The chemical formula for methane is CH4. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year<br />
&nbsp;or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season. The precise conditions under which wetlands produce and consume methane can vary between models.'
<br />
<br />I got the definition of 'wetland' from <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/what-wetland">https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/what-wetland</a> - I wanted to find something that wasn't too tied in to CMIP6 definitions. Okay?

water_table_depth (canonical units: m)
<br />
'Depth is the vertical distance below the surface. The water table is the surface below which the soil is saturated with water such that all pore spaces are filled.'
<br />
<br />Okay?
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
