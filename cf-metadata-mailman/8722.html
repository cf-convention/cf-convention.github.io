Dear all
<br />
<br />Martin and Alison have pointed out that four standard names needed for FAFMIP
<br />
haven't yet been proposed. That was my oversight. I would now like to propose:
<br />
<br />sea_water_added_conservative_temperature, degC
<br />
A passive tracer in an ocean model whose surface flux does not come from the
<br />
atmosphere but is imposed externally upon the simulated climate system. The
<br />
surface flux is expressed as a heat flux and converted to a passive tracer
<br />
increment as if it were a heat flux being added to conservative temperature.
<br />
The passive tracer is transported within the ocean as if it were conservative
<br />
temperature.  The passive tracer is zero in the control climate of the model.
<br />
The passive tracer records added heat, as described for the CMIP6 FAFMIP
<br />
experiment (doi:10.5194/gmd-9-3993-2016), following earlier ideas.
<br />
** Then repeat the definition of sea_water_conservative_temperature.
<br />
<br />sea_water_added_potential_temperature, degC
<br />
A passive tracer in an ocean model whose surface flux does not come from the
<br />
atmosphere but is imposed externally upon the simulated climate system. The
<br />
surface flux is expressed as a heat flux and converted to a passive tracer
<br />
increment as if it were a heat flux being added to potential temperature. The
<br />
passive tracer is transported within the ocean as if it were potential
<br />
temperature.  The passive tracer is zero in the control climate of the model.
<br />
The passive tracer records added heat, as described for the CMIP6 FAFMIP
<br />
experiment (doi:10.5194/gmd-9-3993-2016), following earlier ideas.
<br />
Potential temperature of sea water is the temperature a parcel of sea water
<br />
would have if moved adiabatically to sea level pressure.
<br />
<br />sea_water_redistributed_conservative_temperature, degC
<br />
A passive tracer in an ocean model which is subject to an externally imposed
<br />
perturbative surface heat flux. The passive tracer is initialised to the
<br />
conservative temperature in the control climate before the perturbation is
<br />
imposed. Its surface flux is the heat flux from the atmosphere, not including
<br />
the imposed perturbation, and is converted to a passive tracer increment as
<br />
if it were being added to conservative temperature. The passivetracer is
<br />
transported within the ocean as if it were conservative temperature. The
<br />
passive tracer records redistributed heat, as described for the CMIP6 FAFMIP
<br />
experiment (doi:10.5194/gmd-9-3993-2016), following earlier ideas.
<br />
** Then repeat the definition of sea_water_conservative_temperature.
<br />
<br />sea_water_redistributed_potential_temperature, degC
<br />
A passive tracer in an ocean model which is subject to an externally imposed
<br />
perturbative surface heat flux. The passive tracer is initialised to the
<br />
potential temperature in the control climate before the perturbation is
<br />
imposed. Its surface flux is the heat flux from the atmosphere, not including
<br />
the imposed perturbation, and is converted to a passive tracer increment
<br />
as if it were being added to potential temperature. The passive tracer is
<br />
transported within the ocean as if it were potential temperature. The passive
<br />
tracer records redistributed heat, as described for the CMIP6 FAFMIP
<br />
experiment (doi:10.5194/gmd-9-3993-2016), following earlier ideas.
<br />
Potential temperature of sea water is the temperature a parcel of sea water
<br />
would have if moved adiabatically to sea level pressure.
<br />
<br />I note that in Table 3 of the paper cited we said &quot;additional&quot; temperature for
<br />
the standard names, but throughout the rest of the paper we referred to &quot;added&quot;
<br />
heat (not &quot;additional&quot;), following earlier literature, and in the existing
<br />
CF-netCDF data produced for FAFMIP we have used &quot;added&quot; in the standard names.
<br />
Hence I think this must have been a change of mind and should be regarded as
<br />
a mistake in the paper. We will make a note of it on the FAFMIP website once
<br />
this proposal has been decided upon.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
