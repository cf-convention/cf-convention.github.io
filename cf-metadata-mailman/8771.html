Dear All,
<br />
<br /><br />First, the correct spelling is 'flagellate', not 'flaggelate'.
<br />
<br /><br />Secondly, this proposal causes me concerns because it is adding more biological names (not species but taxonomic phyla, although Flagellate in an unaccepted synonym for Discomitochondria&lt;<a href="http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=146221">http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=146221</a>&gt; - see <a href="http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=146222">http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=146222</a>), which raises the spectre of Trac ticket 99 (I think I've got the number right) where we proposed normalising out biological labels rather than including them explicitly in Standard Names.
<br />
<br /><br />I think we got to the stage with this ticket of agreeing that normalisation would be a good idea, but without coming up with firm details of how the taxon label should be incorporated into the CF Parameter attributes to qualify a Standard Name such as 'mass_concentration_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water'. I would start the ball rolling by pushing WoRMS as the authoritative taxonomic reference and the the label should include both human-readable information an the AphiaID (which can be used as the basis for a WoRMS URL). Other suggestions or ideas on how this information should be encoded syntactically welcome!
<br />
<br /><br />I think Daniels' proposal forces the issue. Either the Trac ticket is taken to completion - presumably by somebody writing a section for the CF1.8 document - or we give up the idea and allow explicit taxon labels with the Standard Names.
<br />
<br /><br />I would favour the former approach, but appreciate that work needs to be done and needs to be done quickly if we are not to block Daniel's work. I can put some time in, but would need some assistance. Any volunteers?
<br />
<br /><br />Cheers, Roy.

Subject: [CF-metadata] Proposing new names for marine biogeochemical modeling
<br />
<br />Dear List,
<br />
<br />I would like to propose 10 new standard names for cyanobacteria and
<br />
flagellates (five each). Similar names exist already for diatoms. The
<br />
descriptions are copied except for the species-specific part. There is
<br />
no urgency in processing this proposal but it produces considerably less
<br />
work than my other one.
<br />
<br />We only need six of them (three per species). But, by suggesting these
<br />
ten names, each diatom standard name has a corresponding cyanobacteria
<br />
and flagellate name.
<br />
<br />The standard names are:
<br />
<br />mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_chlorophyll_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
mole_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
mole_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_chlorophyll_in_sea_water
<br />
mass_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
mole_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
mole_concentration_of_flaggelates_expressed_as_nitrogen_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Please find the descriptions and units further below in this email.
<br />
<br />Further I would like to propose two minor and one major changes in the
<br />
descriptions of the existing diatom standard names. I will describe the
<br />
change, print first the old description, and then print the new description.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Daniel

<br />NEW NAMES
<br />
<br />mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the
<br />
construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material
<br />
constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a
<br />
single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as
<br />
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the
<br />
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A.
<br />
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated
<br />
solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other
<br />
chemical constituents of A. Cyanobacteria in this context are
<br />
dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs), which perform photosynthesis
<br />
and produce oxygen.

<br /><br />mass_concentration_of_cyanobacteria_expressed_as_chlorophyll_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the

described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as

<br />
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated

<br />
chemical constituents of A. Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in
<br />
most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for
<br />
photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of
<br />
chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical
<br />
formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose
<br />
structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain
<br />
between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Cyanobacteria in this context are

their locomotion. Flagellates are a diverse group of organisms, some are

<br />
there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis.

<br />
<br />CHANGE:
<br />
Some part of the description was missing in the end (copied from other
<br />
descriptions).
<br />
<br />OLD:
<br />
Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called
<br />
&quot;molarity&quot;, and is used in the construction
<br />
mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A
<br />
chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as
<br />
'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase
<br />
'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is
<br />
a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the
<br />
standard name is calculated in terms of B alone, neglecting all other
<br />
chemical constituents of A.

<br />
chemical constituents of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the
<br />
standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A,
<br />
neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Diatoms are
<br />
single-celled phytoplankton with an external skeleton made of silica.
<br />
Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live
<br />
near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support
<br />
photosynthesis.
