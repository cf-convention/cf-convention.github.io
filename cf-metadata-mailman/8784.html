Dear Elisa, All,
<br />
<br />I am proposing these new standard names on behalf of Elisa Manzini. They are needed for the CMIP6 Dynvar experiment.
<br />
<br />I am sure that Elisa will comment on the names and definitions in due course and other comments and suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
<br />
<br />1. (CMIP6 short name psitem)
<br />
atmosphere_transformed_eulerian_mean_meridional_overturning_mass_streamfunction (canonical units: kg s-1)
<br />
'The &quot;meridional mass streamfunction&quot; is a streamfunction of the zonally averaged mass transport in the meridional plane. The &quot;Transformed Eulerian Mean&quot; refers to a formulation of the mean equations which incorporates some eddy terms into the definition of the mean, described in Andrews et al (1987): Middle Atmospheric Dynamics. Academic Press.'
<br />
<br />2. (CMIP6 short name tauupbl)
<br />
surface_downward_eastward_stress_due_to_boundary_layer_mixing (canonical units: Pa)
<br />
'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;Downward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). &quot;Downward eastward&quot; indicates the ZX component of a tensor. A downward eastward stress is a downward flux of eastward momentum, which accelerates the lower medium eastward and the upper medium westward. The surface downward stress is the windstress on the surface. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.'
<br />
<br />3. (CMIP6 short name tauvpbl)
<br />
surface_downward_northward_stress_due_to_boundary_layer_mixing (canonical units: Pa)
<br />
'The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. &quot;Downward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). Downward northward&quot; indicates the ZY component of a tensor. A downward northward stress is a downward flux of northward momentum, which accelerates the lower medium northward and the upper medium southward. The surface downward stress is the windstress on the surface. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.'
<br />
<br />4. (CMIP6 short name tntnogw)
<br />
tendency_of_air_temperature_due_to_dissipation_of_nonorographic_gravity_waves (canonical units: K s-1)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Nonorographic&quot; gravity waves refer to gravity waves which are not generated by flow over orography. The dissipation of gravity waves generates heating through an eddy heat flux convergence and through a viscous stress term.'
<br />
<br />5. (CMIP6 short name tntogw)
<br />
tendency_of_air_temperature_due_to_dissipation_of_orographic_gravity_waves (canonical units: K s-1)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Orographic gravity waves&quot; refer to gravity waves which are generated by flow over orography. The dissipation of gravity waves generates heating through an eddy heat flux convergence and through a viscous stress term.'
<br />
<br />6. (CMIP6 short name utendvtem)
<br />
tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_advection_by_the_northward_transformed_eulerian_mean_air_velocity (canonical units: m s-2)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name &quot;upward_air_velocity&quot;). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. The &quot;Transformed Eulerian Mean&quot; refers to a formulation of the mean equations which incorporates some eddy terms into the definition of the mean, described in Andrews et al (1987): Middle Atmospheric Dynamics. Academic Press.'
<br />
<br />7. (CMIP6 short name utendwtem)
<br />
tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_advection_by_the_upward_transformed_eulerian_mean_air_velocity (canonical units: m s-2)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Eastward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name &quot;upward_air_velocity&quot;).

<br />
<br />8. (CMIP6 short name vtendnogw)
<br />
tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_nonorographic_gravity_wave_drag (canonical units: m s-2)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name &quot;upward_air_velocity&quot;). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Nonorographic&quot; gravity waves refer to gravity waves which are not generated by flow over orography. The quantity with standard name tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_gravity_wave_drag is the total tendency of the northward wind due to gravity waves. It is the sum of the tendencies due to orographic and nonorographic gravity waves which have the standard names tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_orographic_gravity_wave_drag and tendency_of_northward_win<br />
d_due_to_nonorographic_gravity_wave_drag, respectively.'
<br />
<br />9. (CMIP6 short name vtendogw)
<br />
tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_orographic_gravity_wave_drag (canonical units: m s-2)
<br />
'The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name &quot;upward_air_velocity&quot;). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Orographic gravity waves&quot; refer to gravity waves which are generated by flow over orography. The quantity with standard name tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_gravity_wave_drag is the total tendency of the northward wind due to gravity waves. It is the sum of the tendencies due to orographic and nonorographic gravity waves which have the standard names tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_orographic_gravity_wave_drag and tendency_of_northward_wind_due_t<br />
o_nonorographic_gravity_wave_drag, respectively.'
<br />
<br />10. (CMIP6 short name wtem)
<br />
upward_transformed_eulerian_mean_air_velocity (canonical units: m s-1)
<br />
'A velocity is a vector quantity. &quot;Upward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). Upward air velocity is the vertical component of the 3D air velocity vector. The &quot;Transformed Eulerian Mean&quot; refers to a formulation of the mean equations which incorporates some eddy terms into the definition of the mean, described in Andrews et al (1987): Middle Atmospheric Dynamics.
