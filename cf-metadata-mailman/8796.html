Dear Alison,
<br />
<br />Thank you so much for your digging through the remaining ISMIP6 standard names! 
<br />
<br />I am OK with everything below, including using land_ice_basal_drag
<br />
<br />With kind regards
<br />
<br />Sophie

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Sophie,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for contacting me about the remaining ISMIP6 names. I recall that much of the discussion of these names had centred around the definitions, rather than the names themselves. I've now looked back through our various conversations from 2016 and 2017 and I think that most of the outstanding points were resolved in your posting <a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2017/059199.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2017/059199.html</a> -  sorry I didn't pick up on that at the time. Below is a summary of what I think is the latest status of the names (the numbers refer to your original list of proposals).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 16. land_ice_mass (kg)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;Land ice&quot; means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves. The horizontal domain over which the quantity is calculated is described by the associated coordinate variables and coordinate bounds or by a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with the standard name of &quot;region&quot; supplied according to section 6.1.1 of the CF conventions.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as I can see, this one was resolved by adding the sentence about the horizontal domain to the definition. I've now marked this name as accepted and will include it in the next update of the standard name table on April 16th.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 17. land_ice_mass_not_displacing_sea_water (kg)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There was quite a lot of discussion about which elements of land ice are included/excluded in this name and you amended the definition to:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;Land ice not displacing sea water&quot; means land ice that would not alter sea level if the ice were converted to water and added to the ocean.  It excludes ice shelves (and any other sort of floating ice) and it excludes a fraction of grounded ice-sheet mass equivalent to the mass of any sea water it displaces.  It includes glaciers and a portion of grounded ice-sheet mass exceeding the mass of any sea water displaced. The quantity with standard name land_ice_mass_not_displacing_sea_water is the total mass integrated over an area of land ice. The geographical extent of the ice over which the mass was calculated should be described by providing bounds on the horizontal coordinate variable or scalar with the standard name of &quot;region&quot; supplied according to section 6.1.1 of the CF convention.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as I can see, this answered the points that had been raised by Jonathan and Karl and no further comments have been received. I've now added your definition and accepted the name. It will be added in the next update.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 23. magnitude_of_land_ice_basal_drag (Pa)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The magnitude of basal drag at land ice base.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There was a question about the definition and I see that in <a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2017/059199.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2017/059199.html</a> you asked to change this one to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; land_ice_basal_drag (Pa)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;Land ice&quot; means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves. Basal drag is a resistive stress opposing ice flow at the ice bedrock boundary.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the later version of the name, units and definition are okay. Are you happy for this one to go into the standard name table as land_ice_basal_drag? If so, then I think this one can be accepted and added at the next update.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 24. tendency_of_land_ice_mass_due_to_surface_mass_balance (kg s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;Land ice&quot; means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves. The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Mass balance&quot; means the net rate at which ice is added. A negative value means loss of ice. The tendency in ice mass due to the surface mass balance is the spatial integral of the quantity with standard name land_ice_surface_specific_mass_balance_flux. The horizontal domain over which the quantity is described by the associated coordinate variables and coordinate bounds or by a string valued coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with a standard name of &quot;region&quot;.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the discussion I asked some questions about whether it was correct to say 'surface' in this name and Jonathan replied that it is. We also added the sentence to the definition regarding the horizontal domain. This name is accepted and will be added to the standard name table in the next update.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While checking on the ISMIP6 names I found two more that were still marked as being under discussion, although in fact they seem to have been agreed in 2016: <a href="http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2016/059064.html">http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2016/059064.html</a>. (The only question was whether to include 'flux' in the specific mass balance names which are referred to in the definitions. We did decide to include it, so the question is resolved). I've now also marked these two as accepted and they will be included in the next update to the standard name table.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 25. tendency_of_land_ice_mass_due_to_basal_mass_balance (kg s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;Land ice&quot; means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves. The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Mass balance means the net rate at which ice is accumulated. A negative value means loss of ice. The tendency in ice mass due to the basal mass balance is the spatial integral of the quantity with standard name land_ice_basal_specific_mass_balance_flux. The geographical extent of the ice over which the mass is calculated is defined by the horizontal coordinates and any associated coordinate bounds or by a string valued auxiliary coordinate variable with a standard name of &quot;region&quot;.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 26. tendency_of_land_ice_mass_due_to_calving (kg s-1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ' &quot;Land ice&quot; means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. The tendency in ice mass due to calving is the spatial integral of the quantity named land_ice_specific_mass_flux_due_to_calving. The geographical extent over which the quantity is calculated is defined by the horizontal coordinates and any associated coordinate bounds or by a string valued auxiliary coordinate variable with a standard name of &quot;region&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apologies for the delay in finalizing these last few names. If you can confirm that the basal_drag term is okay then I think all the ISMIP6 names will be complete.
