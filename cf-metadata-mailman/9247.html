Hi all -
<br />
<br />I like Ken K's definitions; simple and to the point;? And I agree that 
<br />
we need to be explicit
<br />
about positive direction (which term, by the way, doesn't google well).
<br />
<br />I'm not sure I agree with Roy that 'zero is platform at rest' - could 
<br />
you please explain
<br />
that? By 'at rest' do we mean that no forces are operating on the 
<br />
platform? Would? a buoy
<br />
have roll and heave angles if its deck load were out of balance?? If its 
<br />
deck isn't level, what
<br />
term would describe that? I suppose you're building on the fact that 
<br />
these rotations are
<br />
relative to the internal axes of the platform, with no relation to the 
<br />
'real world'.
<br />
<br />It does seem like we're converging ... maybe.
<br />
<br />Cheers - Nan
<br />
<br />-

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Dear All, &gt; &gt; &gt; Giving it some thought over the weekend I realise 
</em><br />
that where we lost &gt; the plot in this discussion was when we encountered 
<br />
'direction of &gt; travel'. Jim succinctly described platform motion with 
<br />
the phrase &gt; 'nested co-ordinate systems'. What I failed to realise - 
<br />
and I'm &gt; guessing I'm not alone - is that the pitch, roll, heave etc. 
<br />
family &gt; of terms for platform motion refer SOLELY to the innermost &gt; 
<br />
co-ordinate reference in that nest and that the 'zero' for these &gt; 
<br />
measurements is 'platform at rest'. This innermost co-ordinate &gt; 
<br />
reference comprises three orthogonal axes that intersect at the &gt; 
<br />
platform's centre of gravity. Two of these are horizontal (Ken's &gt; 
<br />
longitudinal X-axis and transverse Y-axis) and the third vertical &gt; 
<br />
(Ken's vertical Z-axis). Others make no attempt to treat these &gt; 
<br />
parameters in the same way as zenith, and I now realise CF shouldn't &gt; 
<br />
be any different. &gt; &gt; &gt; Having come to terms with this, Ken's definition 
<br />
elements have a &gt; beautiful simplicity that can be slotted into Alison's 
<br />
compound &gt; definitions. My only problem is the inclusion of nautical 
<br />
terms like &gt; 'bow' and 'stern', but these can easily be replaced by 
<br />
generic &gt; equivalents such as 'front' and 'back'. I would also make it 
<br />
clearer &gt; is that zero is platform at rest. &gt; &gt; &gt; For example the 
<br />
definition pair for yaw become: &gt; &gt; &gt; platform_yaw_angle &gt; &gt; &quot;yaw 
<br />
_angle&quot; is the amount of rotation from the rest position around &gt; the 
<br />
vertical Z-axis with positive values resulting in clockwise &gt; motion 
<br />
when viewed from above. The vertical Z axis, also known as the &gt; &quot;yaw 
<br />
axis&quot;, is an imaginary line running vertically through the &gt; platform's 
<br />
centre of gravity. Standard names for &quot;platform&quot; describe &gt; the motion 
<br />
and orientation of the vehicle from which observations are &gt; made. 
<br />
Platforms include, but are not limited to, satellites, &gt; aeroplanes, 
<br />
ships, instruments and buoys. &gt; &gt; &gt; platform_yaw_rate &gt; &gt; 
<br />
&quot;platform_yaw_rate&quot; is the change per unit time of &quot;yaw_angle&quot;. &quot;yaw &gt; 
<br />
_angle&quot; is the amount of rotation from the rest position around the &gt; 
<br />
vertical Z-axis with positive values resulting in clockwise motion &gt; 
<br />
when viewed from above. The vertical Z axis, also known as the &quot;yaw &gt;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; All, &gt; &gt; Sorry for joining this conversation late. This is an 
</em><br />
important &gt; discussion for my group and finding a resolution would be 
<br />
very &gt; helpful. For my purposes I only need a good definition, which 
<br />
might &gt; coincide with the nautical definitions. For example this 
<br />
reference &gt; &lt;<a href="https://www.wartsila.com/encyclopedia/term/ship-motions">https://www.wartsila.com/encyclopedia/term/ship-motions</a>&gt; 
<br />
would &gt; suffice for most of my needs except for the missing definition 
<br />
of &gt; positive direction. I've asked about defining a positive direction 
<br />
in &gt; the past using the &quot;positive&quot; attribute and it was decided to not &gt; 
<br />
expand that attribute. If we can define the positive direction in all &gt; 
<br />
the platform standard names that would be great, but it should be &gt; 
<br />
universally existent for all current and future platform &gt; definitions. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; I would prefer to not get into the details of how a value is 
</em><br />
derived &gt; in the definition as that is more of the cell_methods domain. 
<br />
Also I &gt; find that confusing as heave on an ocean going ship is not 
<br />
always &gt; measured as the difference between two GPS points but could be 
<br />
an &gt; integration of a speed or acceleration. This would result in two &gt; 
<br />
different measurements that depend on the method, but both are &gt; 
<br />
correct. &gt; &gt; I next attempted to come up with some definitions but I 
<br />
ended up &gt; going down a wormhole of different reference frames only to 
<br />
realize &gt; in the end my definitions will never match with the values 
<br />
from the &gt; vendor supplied data values because my definitions were 
<br />
becoming too &gt; specific. I can't find a definition of heave that takes 
<br />
into account &gt; tides, large waves (water or atmospheric), or orientation 
<br />
of the &gt; platform. They all seem to be relative to the platform position 
<br />
some &gt; x time ago. So here is my attempt at the definitions: &gt; &gt; 
<br />
platform_heave = Heave is the linear motion along the vertical &gt; Z-axis 
<br />
(e.g. keel to top of mast) with positive values representing &gt; upward 
<br />
motion. &gt; &gt; platform_sway = Sway is the motion along the transverse 
<br />
Y-axis (e.g. &gt; port to starboard) with positive values towards the 
<br />
right-hand side &gt; the platform (starboard) when oriented towards leading 
<br />
edge of the &gt; platform. &gt; &gt; platform_surge = Surge is the motion along 
<br />
the longitudinal X-axis &gt; (e.g. stern to bow) with positive values 
<br />
indicating motion towards &gt; the leading edge of the platform (bow). &gt; &gt; 
<br />
platform_roll_angle = Roll is a rotation around a longitudinal X-axis &gt; 
<br />
with positive values resulting in counter clockwise motion (e.g. &gt; 
<br />
right-hand side rising) when oriented towards leading edge of the &gt; 
<br />
platform. &gt; &gt; platform_pitch_angle = Pitch is a rotation around the 
<br />
transverse &gt; Y-axis with positive values resulting in counter clockwise 
<br />
motion &gt; (e.g. leading edge of the platform rising). &gt; &gt; 
<br />
platform_yaw_angle = Yaw is a rotation around the vertical Z-axis &gt; with 
<br />
positive values resulting in clockwise motion of the forward &gt; section 
<br />
(bow) when viewed from above. &gt; &gt; platform_roll_rate = Roll rate is 
<br />
rotation change per unit time &gt; around a longitudinal X-axis with 
<br />
positive values resulting in &gt; counter clockwise motion (e.g. right-hand 
<br />
side rising) when oriented &gt; towards leading edge of the platform. &gt; &gt; 
<br />
platform_pitch_rate = Pitch rate is rotation change per unit time &gt; 
<br />
around the transverse Y-axis with positive values resulting in &gt; counter 
<br />
clockwise motion (e.g. leading edge of the platform rising). &gt; &gt; 
<br />
platform_yaw_rate = Yaw rate is rotation change per unit time around &gt; 
<br />
the vertical Z-axis with positive values resulting in clockwise &gt; motion 
<br />
of the forward section (bow) when viewed from above. &gt; &gt; I know these 
<br />
differ from the current definitions, but I'm not &gt; completely 
<br />
understanding how the definitions are created. Is &gt; platform_orientation 
<br />
always prepended? Is a rate always defined with &gt; the same as the angle 
<br />
definition but with a final sentence explaining &gt; it's actually a rate?

Alison, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It's a lovely nested reference frames problem, isn't it? 
<br />
Roll, &gt;&gt; pitch, and yaw are usually defined relative to a center of 
<br />
motion &gt;&gt; (CM) reference frame defined using the (mean) direction of 
<br />
motion &gt;&gt; and the up direction. In my (satellite-based) experience, the 
<br />
Y &gt;&gt; axis unit vector is defined by the normalized cross-product of the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; up unit vector with the direction of motion unit vector (Z x X). &gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
The X axis unit vector is then defined by the cross-product of the &gt;&gt; Y 
<br />
unit vector and the up unit vector (Y x Z). This means of forming &gt;&gt; the 
<br />
CM reference frame decouples orientation from motion. The X &gt;&gt; axis is 
<br />
not necessarily identical to the direction of motion. The &gt;&gt; vehicle 
<br />
reference frame may have fixed offsets in x, y, z, roll, &gt;&gt; pitch, and 
<br />
yaw relative to the CM reference frame, but in my &gt;&gt; limited experience 
<br />
those offsets have been zero. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Platforms that aren't moving are an 
<br />
even more entertaining case, &gt;&gt; for sure! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In the end, I'd tend 
<br />
towards referring to a CM or geospatial &gt;&gt; reference frame with the Z 
<br />
direction defined as &quot;up&quot; if I'm going &gt;&gt; to try and get detailed about 
<br />
it, as opposed to 'mean orientation'. &gt;&gt; But I only have experience with 
<br />
satellites (and a bit with &gt;&gt; airplanes). &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Grace and peace, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

Hi Roy and Jim, &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for your quick comments on the 
<br />
definitions. I have just &gt;&gt;&gt; been looking again at the suggested text 
<br />
for yaw_angle: 'Platform &gt;&gt;&gt; yaw angle is the angle between the 
<br />
platform's longitudinal/X axis &gt;&gt;&gt; and the direction of travel. Zero yaw 
<br />
angle means the &gt;&gt;&gt; longitudinal axis is aligned with the direction of 
<br />
travel, or a &gt;&gt;&gt; reference direction if the platform is stationary. The 
<br />
usual sign &gt;&gt;&gt; convention is that yaw angle is measured positive when 
<br />
the front &gt;&gt;&gt; or leading edge of the platform is rotated clockwise from 
<br />
its &gt;&gt;&gt; orientation (which has the standard name platform_orientation).' 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is how to describe the reference direction which 
</em><br />
the &gt;&gt;&gt; angle is calculated relative to. I started out by talking about 
<br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; 'direction of travel' and later referred to &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
'platform_orientation'. The definition of platform_orientation &gt;&gt;&gt; says 
<br />
'The platform orientation is the direction in which the &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;front&quot; or 
<br />
longitudinal axis of the platform is pointing (not &gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily the 
<br />
same as the direction in which it is travelling, &gt;&gt;&gt; called 
<br />
platform_course).' I've realised my new definition doesn't &gt;&gt;&gt; really 
<br />
make sense if direction of travel and orientation aren't &gt;&gt;&gt; the same 
<br />
(and clearly they can be different). Also, if &gt;&gt;&gt; 'orientation' is the 
<br />
instantaneous direction of the longitudinal &gt;&gt;&gt; axis, then presumably it 
<br />
includes yaw angle, so it isn't the &gt;&gt;&gt; right reference for measuring 
<br />
yaw. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I've revised the text as follows: 'Platform yaw angle is 
<br />
the &gt;&gt;&gt; angle between the platform's longitudinal/X axis and the &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
platform's mean orientation (i.e. its orientation not including &gt;&gt;&gt; high 
<br />
frequency variations due to swaying and rocking motions, for &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
example, ship motions caused by the passing of sea surface &gt;&gt;&gt; waves). 
<br />
Zero yaw angle means the longitudinal axis is aligned &gt;&gt;&gt; with the mean 
<br />
orientation. The usual sign convention is that yaw &gt;&gt;&gt; angle is measured 
<br />
positive when the front or leading edge of the &gt;&gt;&gt; platform is rotated 
<br />
clockwise from its mean orientation (which &gt;&gt;&gt; has the standard name 
<br />
platform_orientation). &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Does it sound okay to refer to a 'mean 
<br />
orientation' in this way? &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm having trouble thinking of a better 
<br />
wording! &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Best wishes, Alison &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; -----Original

Re: [CF-metadata] Platform Heave &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Steve, Nan, et al, &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
Thank you for proposing new standard names for platform_heave and &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
improved definitions for existing names for platform pitch, roll &gt;&gt;&gt; and 
<br />
yaw. Thank you also to all those who submitted comments about &gt;&gt;&gt; these 
<br />
names. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Steve's proposals for new names, the discussion 
<br />
seems &gt;&gt;&gt; to have reached consensus on the quantities themselves. &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Until now, our usual explanatory sentence for 'platform' has said 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Standard names for platform describe the motion and orientation

ship or satellite.' Nan has suggested extending the list of &gt;&gt;&gt; possible 
<br />
platforms, which seems fair enough, so we would now have &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Standard 
<br />

buoys.' I've added this into the definitions of &gt;&gt;&gt; Steve's names, 
<br />
leading to: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; platform_heave (m) 'Standard names for &quot;platform&quot;

six existing platform pitch, roll and yaw names: &gt;&gt;&gt;

platform_pitch_angle (degree) platform_pitch_rate (degree s-1) &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
platform_roll_angle (degree) platform_roll_rate (degree s-1) &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
platform_yaw_angle (degree) platform_yaw_rate (degree s-1) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Nan 
<br />
has suggested the following definitions, based on &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_motions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_motions</a> &gt;&gt;&gt; (A quick search of other 
<br />
online sources yields definitions &gt;&gt;&gt; consistent with these). Pitch The 
<br />
up/down rotation of a platform &gt;&gt;&gt; about its transverse/Y axis. The 
<br />
transverse/Y axis, lateral or &gt;&gt;&gt; pitch axis is an imaginary line 
<br />
running horizontally across the &gt;&gt;&gt; platform and through its center of 
<br />
gravity. A pitch motion is an &gt;&gt;&gt; up-or-down movement of the bow and 
<br />
stern of the platform. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Roll The tilting rotation of a platform 
<br />
about its longitudinal/X &gt;&gt;&gt; axis. The longitudinal/X axis, or roll 
<br />
axis, is an imaginary line &gt;&gt;&gt; running horizontally through the length 
<br />
of the platform, through &gt;&gt;&gt; its center of gravity, and parallel to the 
<br />
waterline. A roll &gt;&gt;&gt; motion is a side-to-side or port-starboard tilting 
<br />
motion of the &gt;&gt;&gt; superstructure around this axis. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yaw The 
<br />
turning rotation of a platform about its vertical/Z axis. &gt;&gt;&gt; The 
<br />
vertical/Z axis, or yaw axis, is an imaginary line running &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
vertically through the platform and through its center of &gt;&gt;&gt; gravity. A 
<br />
yaw motion is a side-to side movement of the bow and &gt;&gt;&gt; stern of the 
<br />
ship. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; These are useful and concise definitions. I suggest that 
<br />
we don't &gt;&gt;&gt; refer anywhere to 'ship', 'bow' or 'stern', since we want 
<br />
the &gt;&gt;&gt; definitions to apply to all possible platforms. I'm thinking 
<br />
also &gt;&gt;&gt; that 'port' and 'starboard' may apply to ships and aeroplanes, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; but perhaps not to a satellite, so are probably best avoided. &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
Similarly, 'waterline' only applies to maritime platforms. I &gt;&gt;&gt; suggest 
<br />
the following amendments to make the definitions as &gt;&gt;&gt; generic as 
<br />
possible: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Pitch &quot;Pitch&quot; means rotation of the platform in the 
<br />
vertical &gt;&gt;&gt; plane about its transverse/Y axis. The transverse/Y axis, 
<br />
also &gt;&gt;&gt; known as the &quot;lateral axis&quot; or &quot;pitch axis&quot;, is an imaginary 
<br />
line &gt;&gt;&gt; running horizontally across the platform and through its center 
<br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; of gravity. In pitch motion, the leading edge of the platform &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
moves vertically upwards while the rear moves vertically &gt;&gt;&gt; downwards, 
<br />
and vice versa. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Roll &quot;Roll&quot; means rotation of the platform in 
<br />
the vertical plane &gt;&gt;&gt; about its longitudinal/X axis. The longitudinal/X 
<br />
axis, also &gt;&gt;&gt; known as the &quot;roll axis&quot;, is an imaginary line running 
<br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; horizontally through the length of the platform and through its &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
center of gravity. In roll motion, the platform tilts such that &gt;&gt;&gt; one 
<br />
side moves vertically upwards while the other moves &gt;&gt;&gt; vertically 
<br />
downwards, and vice versa. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yaw &quot;Yaw&quot; means rotation of the 
<br />
platform in the horizontal plane &gt;&gt;&gt; about its vertical/Z axis. The 
<br />
vertical/Z axis, also known as the &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;yaw axis&quot;, is an imaginary line 
<br />
running vertically through the &gt;&gt;&gt; platform and through its center of 
<br />
gravity. In yaw motion, the &gt;&gt;&gt; platform rotates clockwise or counter 
<br />
clockwise in the &gt;&gt;&gt; horizontal, relative to its orientation, which has 
<br />
the standard &gt;&gt;&gt; name platform_orientation. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Are these okay? &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; For names such as platform_view_angle and platform_zenith_angle &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
we also describe how the angle itself is measured. We should do &gt;&gt;&gt; the 
<br />
same for pitch, roll and yaw angles while we are in the &gt;&gt;&gt; process of 
<br />
updating the definitions. I have come up with the &gt;&gt;&gt; following: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
Pitch angle Platform pitch angle is the angle between the local &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
horizontal and the platform's longitudinal/X axis. Zero pitch &gt;&gt;&gt; angle 
<br />
means the longitudinal axis is horizontal. The usual sign &gt;&gt;&gt; convention 
<br />
is that pitch angle is measured positive when the &gt;&gt;&gt; front or leading 
<br />
edge of the platform is elevated above the &gt;&gt;&gt; horizontal, negative when 
<br />
it is below the horizontal. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Roll angle Platform roll angle is 
<br />
the angle between the local &gt;&gt;&gt; horizontal and the platform's lateral/Y 
<br />
axis. Zero roll angle &gt;&gt;&gt; means the lateral axis is horizontal. The 
<br />
usual sign convention &gt;&gt;&gt; is that roll angle is measured positive when 
<br />
the right hand edge &gt;&gt;&gt; of the platform (when viewing towards the 
<br />
orientation direction &gt;&gt;&gt; or &quot;front&quot; of the platform) is elevated above 
<br />
the horizontal, &gt;&gt;&gt; negative when it is below the horizontal. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
Yaw angle Platform yaw angle is the angle between the platform's &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
longitudinal/X axis and the direction of travel. Zero yaw angle &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
means the longitudinal axis is aligned with the direction of &gt;&gt;&gt; travel, 
<br />
or a reference direction if the platform is stationary. &gt;&gt;&gt; The usual 
<br />
sign convention is that yaw angle is measured positive &gt;&gt;&gt; when the 
<br />
front or leading edge of the platform is rotated &gt;&gt;&gt; clockwise from its 
<br />
orientation (which has the standard name &gt;&gt;&gt; platform_orientation). &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Just so we can see a couple of examples of pulling all this &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
together, I've written out the full revised definitions of &gt;&gt;&gt; platform 
<br />
platform_pitch_angle and platform_pitch_rate below. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
platform_pitch_angle (degree) 'Standard names for &quot;platform&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
describe the motion and orientation of the vehicle from which &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
observations are made. Platforms include, but are not limited to, &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
satellites, aeroplanes, ships, instruments and buoys. &quot;Pitch&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; means 
<br />
rotation of the platform in the vertical plane about its &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
transverse/Y axis. The transverse/Y axis, also known as the &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;lateral 
<br />
axis&quot; or &quot;pitch axis&quot;, is an imaginary line running &gt;&gt;&gt; horizontally 
<br />
across the platform and through its center of &gt;&gt;&gt; gravity. In pitch 
<br />
motion, the leading edge of the platform moves &gt;&gt;&gt; vertically upwards 
<br />
while the rear moves vertically downwards, and &gt;&gt;&gt; vice versa. Platform 
<br />
pitch angle is the angle between the local &gt;&gt;&gt; horizontal and the 
<br />
platform's longitudinal/X axis. Zero pitch &gt;&gt;&gt; angle means the 
<br />
longitudinal axis is horizontal. The usual sign &gt;&gt;&gt; convention is that 
<br />
pitch angle is measured positive when the &gt;&gt;&gt; front or leading edge of 
<br />
the platform is elevated above the &gt;&gt;&gt; horizontal, negative when it is 
<br />
below the horizontal.' &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; platform_pitch_rate (degree s-1) 
<br />
'Standard names for &quot;platform&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; describe the motion and orientation 
<br />

vice versa. The quantity with standard name platform_pitch_rate &gt;&gt;&gt; is 
<br />
the change per unit time in the quantity with standard name &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
platform_pitch_angle.' &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The roll and yaw definitions would be 
<br />
constructed similarly. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The pitch/roll/yaw names are still under 
<br />
discussion. I'd welcome &gt;&gt;&gt; further comments on these. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Best

Platform Heave &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Alison, Steve, and all - &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Since we have 
<br />
a little time to finalize this, could we also &gt;&gt;&gt; consider updating the 
<br />
definitions of platform_pitch_angle, &gt;&gt;&gt; platform_roll_angle and 
<br />
platform_yaw_angle? &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Currently, these all say 'Standard names for 
<br />
platform describe &gt;&gt;&gt; the motion and orientation of the vehicle from 
<br />
which observations &gt;&gt;&gt; are made e.g. aeroplane, ship or satellite.' &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />

<br />
'Platforms include but are not limited to &gt;&gt;&gt; satellites, aeroplanes, 
<br />
ships, instruments, and buoys.' &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Pitch The up/down rotation of a 
<br />
platform about its transverse/Y &gt;&gt;&gt; axis. The transverse/Y axis, lateral 
<br />
or pitch axis is an &gt;&gt;&gt; imaginary line running horizontally across the 
<br />
platform and &gt;&gt;&gt; through its center of gravity. A pitch motion is an 
<br />
up-or-down &gt;&gt;&gt; movement of the bow and stern of the platform. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
Roll The tilting rotation of a platform about its longitudinal/X &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
axis. The longitudinal/X axis, or roll axis, is an imaginary line &gt;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
running horizontally through the length of the platform, through &gt;&gt;&gt; its 
<br />
center of gravity, and parallel to the waterline. A roll &gt;&gt;&gt; motion is a 
<br />
side-to-side or port-starboard tilting motion of the &gt;&gt;&gt; superstructure 
<br />
around this axis. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yaw The turning rotation of a platform about 
<br />
its vertical/Z axis. &gt;&gt;&gt; The vertical/Z axis, or yaw axis, is an 
<br />
imaginary line running &gt;&gt;&gt; vertically through the platform and through 
<br />
its center of &gt;&gt;&gt; gravity. A yaw motion is a side-to side movement of 
<br />
the bow and &gt;&gt;&gt; stern of the ship. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; And we had something like 
<br />
this for heave: platform_heave (m) = &gt;&gt;&gt; upwards vertical displacement 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose these could also be applied to platform_*_rates. &gt;&gt;&gt;

all possible, so I like your proposal. I &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expect we should include

platform in the definition, as well as &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an indication that this is

dynamic (over time). How about these &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; definitions? platform_heave

rate of change in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vertical displacement of a platform over a

<br />
the relative &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nature of the quantities. (In my mind, the primary 
<br />
detail being &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; left out is the 'net zero' nature of the quantities,

which gets &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back to defining the 'moving-mean' sea level reference

would? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the confusion is because you are thinking of 
heave in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terms of position within a reference frame. To think of it 
as &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the vertical displacement between a real platform and a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
massless platform is misleading- such considerations are part &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of 
the derivation of wave height from high frequency heave &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
measurements, which isn't relevant to a discussion of the raw &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
measurement. It's also worth bearing in mind that whilst the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; debate 
has focused on platforms floating on the sea surface, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the concept 
of heave could in theory be applied to objects in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the atmosphere. 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In practice, heave is measured by accelerometers that are 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually combined with tilt sensors that give pitch, roll and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
yaw. Hence, it is totally decoupled from any reference outside &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the 
platform. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To answer your last muse, to get heave from a high 
frequency &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; height relative to datum time series the method would 
need to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; determine the height of the object when 'stationary'. In 
the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; case of objects on the sea, 'stationary' is considered to be a 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flat calm sea (i.e. no waves), which can be approximated by &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
averaging the raw time series. So, heave could be approximated &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by 
differencing the raw and averaged data. However, I can't &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think why 
anybody would want to do that. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers, Roy. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My biggest concern is that the standard name definition makes 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it clear in some fashion or other that this is a measure of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
deviations from some lower frequency (or low-pass filtered) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; measure 
of vertical position. (As are sway and surge in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relation to their 
corresponding horizontal coordinates.) As was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pointed out, heave is 
used in certain communities, so it's &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonable to provide a 
standard name, but it seems rather &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imprecise as it has been 
described so far. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I have understood the explanations 
correctly, a time series &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of platform height relative to a fixed 
datum that has &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sufficient precision and frequency would fully 
represent the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heave along with the more slowly varying effects of 
tide, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; waves, etc. So is heave, as usually used, the first-order 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instantaneous difference between the height of an actual &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
platform and the height of a massless ideal platform that would &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
maintain a fixed offset relative to the sea surface? And, just &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out 
of curiosity, how would a time series of instantaneous &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; measures of 
height relative to a fixed datum be separated in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practice into 
heave and &quot;non-heave&quot; height? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Getting back on track, it seems 
to me that the definition ought &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to somehow assist the reader in 
understanding how heave relates &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to other measures of height. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Jim and John, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heave is indeed a height relative to 
a datum, that datum being &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the calm sea surface, which is a local 
short interval mean sea &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; level that isn't linked into any global 
reference system. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed the 'datum' moves relative to the rest of 
the world - &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but not the platform - as tide rises and falls so many 
would &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prefer to call it an 'instrument zero' rather than a 'datum'. 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heave is therefore a very different measurement to any sea 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; level parameter and is the raw measurement recorded at high (Hz 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to kHz) frequency as a time series by floating wave instruments 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such as waveriders and shipborne wave recorders. It therefore &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
cannot be sensibly described by the same or similar Standard &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Name 
as a measurement of height above a globally referenced &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; datum like 
long-term mean sea level or geoid. Whilst the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Standard Name could 
be 'platform_height_above_calm_sea_surface' &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or 
'platform_height_above_stationary_position' I would argue &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that 
'heave' is a term from the same domain vocabulary as &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'pitch', 
'roll' and 'yaw' and therefore should be used. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John is right 
to point out that the heave measurement is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; affected by the nature 
of the platform with a 250,000 tonne &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supertanker moving up and down 
much less than a rowing boat in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a given wave climate, especially a 
wind sea. That was what was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behind the SBWR corrections based on 
platform dimensions set up &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by Laurie Draper and Tom Tucker back in 
the 1980s. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers, Roy. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Sent: 26 May 2018 04:48 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can't let go of this yet. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If 
you think about the inverse problem of deriving the sea &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; surface 
elevation from the heave you would have to account for &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the latency 
of ship motion relative to the sea-surface. A wave &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; passing under a 
ship induces motions that are not instantaneous &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; either in attack or 
decay. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; J. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On 5/25/18 20:42, John Helly wrote: I

Ship motions are defined by the six degrees of freedom that a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ship, 
boat or any other craft can experience. Could just be &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jargon but it 
strike me as more complex: nonetheless a vertical &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; position relative 
to a datum, but the buoyancy, stability and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; momentum of the 
platform are implied as part of the dynamics. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems that the 
datum is not a geophysical one alone but &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confounded with the 
'normal' waterline for a platform so it may &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be relative to the 
water level in which the platform is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; embedded. That's a tough one. 
Two different platforms on the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same sea surface would have 
different 'heave', for example. J.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear All,    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with Nan that definitions of pitch roll and yaw &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would 
improve the existing Standard Name definitions. I &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also agree with 
using the existing orientation Standard &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Names for ADCPs and that 
the 'platform' definition &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wording could make this clearer. However, 
such an &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enhancements should be submitted as a separate proposal 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and not be considered as part of Steve's proposal. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers, Roy.
