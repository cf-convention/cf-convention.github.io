# Discussion
 
Discussion about CF Metadata takes place on GitHub in three forums,
using [GitHub issues][github_issues].

*   [General discussion and standard names][github_discuss]

    For proposing standard names, asking questions or having discussions about the
    interpretation and use of the CF conventions, and initial
    suggestions for proposals to change or extend the CF conventions.

    There is also a separate website detailing the [status of current
    proposals for new standard names][current] that have been
    initiated on the general discussion forum.
  
*   [Conventions][github_conventions]

    For proposing enhancements and reporting defects in the CF
    conventions, that may or may not have started as conversations on
    the general discussion forum.

*   [Website and governance][github_website]

    For discussing, proposing changes and reporting defects in the [CF
    website][website], and for discussion of CF governance.

No registration with CF is required to contribute; all that is needed
is a freely available [GitHub account][github].

Before the CF community migrated to GitHub,
general and standard-name discussion took place on the
[cf-metadata mailing list][archives], and enhancements
to the conventions were proposed
on the [CF Metadata Trac](Data/trac.html) site.
