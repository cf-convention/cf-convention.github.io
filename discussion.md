# Discussion

CF discussions and decisions are mostly made on [GitHub][github]. No registration with CF is required to contribute; all that is needed is a freely available GitHub account.

### Questions, comments and announcements about CF

To ask a question about how to use CF, to comment on any aspect of CF or to make a suggestion how CF could be changed or improved, please visit CF [GitHub organization Discussions][github_discussions]. There you can start a new discussion, contribute to any of the ongoing ones, and read the previous ones. Announcements about CF are made there as well.

To keep up-to-date with announcements and discussions, go to the [`discuss` repository][github_discuss] and enable notifications from the <svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" width="16" data-view-component="true" class="octicon octicon-eye"><path d="M8 2c1.981 0 3.671.992 4.933 2.078 1.27 1.091 2.187 2.345 2.637 3.023a1.62 1.62 0 0 1 0 1.798c-.45.678-1.367 1.932-2.637 3.023C11.67 13.008 9.981 14 8 14c-1.981 0-3.671-.992-4.933-2.078C1.797 10.83.88 9.576.43 8.898a1.62 1.62 0 0 1 0-1.798c.45-.677 1.367-1.931 2.637-3.022C4.33 2.992 6.019 2 8 2ZM1.679 7.932a.12.12 0 0 0 0 .136c.411.622 1.241 1.75 2.366 2.717C5.176 11.758 6.527 12.5 8 12.5c1.473 0 2.825-.742 3.955-1.715 1.124-.967 1.954-2.096 2.366-2.717a.12.12 0 0 0 0-.136c-.412-.621-1.242-1.75-2.366-2.717C10.824 4.242 9.473 3.5 8 3.5c-1.473 0-2.825.742-3.955 1.715-1.124.967-1.954 2.096-2.366 2.717ZM8 10a2 2 0 1 1-.001-3.999A2 2 0 0 1 8 10Z"></path>

### Proposals to change CF
 
Proposals to change CF are made, debated and decided as [GitHub issues][github_issues] in three repositories:

*   [Vocabulary issues][github_vocabularies], in the [vocabularies repository](https://github.com/cf-convention/vocabularies), for proposing additions or amendments to standard names, their definitions, or other CF controlled vocabulary (area types and standardized regions). [Open a new issue]((https://github.com/cf-convention/vocabularies/new/choose). See also [closed vocabulary issues][github_vocabularies_closed].

    As well as in GitHub issues, the status of proposals about standard names is shown by the [CEDA vocabulary editor][vocab_editor]. To see a list of resolved proposals (accepted or rejected) for standard names from March 2011 onwards, click "Inactive" in the [CEDA vocabulary editor][vocab_editor].
  
*   [Conventions issues][github_conventions], in the [conventions repository](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions), for proposing enhancements and reporting defects in the CF conventions. [Open a new issue]((https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/new/choose). See also [closed conventions issues][github_conventions_closed], classified by reason for closure: [change agreed][github_conventions_change]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[agreement not to change][github_conventions_nochange]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[dormant][github_conventions_dormant]. "Dormant" means the discussion on a proposed change did not reach a conclusion. Dormant issues may be reopened if there is a new impetus or ideas that might help bring about an agreement.

*   [Website and governance issues][github_website], in the [website repository](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io), for proposing changes and reporting defects in the [CF website][website] or CF governance. [Open a new issue]((https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io/new/choose).

You can enable notifications of updates to issues for each kind of issue separately using the <b>Watch</b> menu in its repository.

### Archive links

Announcements, discussions and Q&A that were initiated before CF GitHub Discussions began are continuing as GitHub issues in the `discuss` repository. They will soon be converted to GitHub Discussions.

Before the CF community migrated to GitHub:

* until December 2019, general discussion took place and standard names were proposed on the [cf-metadata mailing list][archives] ([original at NCAR][NCAR_archives]).

* until July 2018, changes to the conventions were proposed on the [CF Metadata Trac][about] site.
