# Discussion

CF discussions and decisions are mostly made on [GitHub][github]. No registration with CF is required to contribute; all that is needed is a freely available GitHub account.

### Questions, comments and announcements about CF

In CF [GitHub organization Discussions][github_discussions] you can [ask a question](https://github.com/orgs/cf-convention/discussions/new?category=q-a-about-using-cf) about how to use CF, [comment](https://github.com/orgs/cf-convention/discussions/new?category=comments-and-ideas-for-changing-cf) on any aspect of CF or make a suggestion how CF could be changed or improved, contribute to any of the ongoing discussions, and read the previous ones. Announcements about CF are made there as well.

To keep up-to-date with announcements and discussions, go to the [`discuss` repository][github_discuss] and enable notifications from the <svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" width="16" data-view-component="true" class="octicon octicon-eye"><path d="M8 2c1.981 0 3.671.992 4.933 2.078 1.27 1.091 2.187 2.345 2.637 3.023a1.62 1.62 0 0 1 0 1.798c-.45.678-1.367 1.932-2.637 3.023C11.67 13.008 9.981 14 8 14c-1.981 0-3.671-.992-4.933-2.078C1.797 10.83.88 9.576.43 8.898a1.62 1.62 0 0 1 0-1.798c.45-.677 1.367-1.931 2.637-3.022C4.33 2.992 6.019 2 8 2ZM1.679 7.932a.12.12 0 0 0 0 .136c.411.622 1.241 1.75 2.366 2.717C5.176 11.758 6.527 12.5 8 12.5c1.473 0 2.825-.742 3.955-1.715 1.124-.967 1.954-2.096 2.366-2.717a.12.12 0 0 0 0-.136c-.412-.621-1.242-1.75-2.366-2.717C10.824 4.242 9.473 3.5 8 3.5c-1.473 0-2.825.742-3.955 1.715-1.124.967-1.954 2.096-2.366 2.717ZM8 10a2 2 0 1 1-.001-3.999A2 2 0 0 1 8 10Z"></path>

### Proposals to change CF
 
Proposals to change CF are made, debated and decided as [GitHub issues][github_issues] in three repositories:

*   [Vocabulary issues][github_vocabularies], in the [vocabularies repository](https://github.com/cf-convention/vocabularies), for proposing additions or amendments to standard names, their definitions, or other CF controlled vocabulary (area types and standardized regions). [Open a new issue](https://github.com/cf-convention/vocabularies/issues/new/choose). See also [closed vocabulary issues][github_vocabularies_closed].

    As well as in GitHub issues, the status of proposals about standard names is shown by the [CEDA vocabulary editor][vocab_editor]. To see a list of resolved proposals (accepted or rejected) for standard names from March 2011 onwards, click "Inactive" in the [CEDA vocabulary editor][vocab_editor].
  
*   [Conventions issues][github_conventions], in the [conventions repository](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions), for proposing enhancements and reporting defects in the CF conventions. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues/new/choose). See also [closed conventions issues][github_conventions_closed], classified by reason for closure: [change agreed][github_conventions_change]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[agreement not to change][github_conventions_nochange]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[dormant][github_conventions_dormant]. "Dormant" means the discussion on a proposed change did not reach a conclusion. Dormant issues may be reopened if there is a new impetus or ideas that might help bring about an agreement.

*   [Website and governance issues][github_website], in the [website repository](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io), for proposing changes and reporting defects in the [CF website][website] or CF governance. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io/issues/new/choose).

You can enable notifications of updates to issues for each kind of issue separately using the <b>Watch</b> menu in its repository.
