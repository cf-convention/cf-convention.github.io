# Discussion
 
Discussion about CF Metadata takes place on GitHub in three forums,
using [GitHub issues][github_issues].

*   [General discussion and standard names][github_discuss]

    For proposing standard names, any discussion about the
    interpretation and use of the CF conventions, and initial
    suggestions for proposals to change or extend the CF conventions.

    There is also a separate website detailing the [status of current
    proposals for new standard names][current] that have been
    initiated on the general discussion forum.
  
*   [Conventions][github_conventions]

    For proposing for enhancements and reporting defects in the CF
    conventions, that may or may not have started as conversations on
    the general discussion forum.

*   [Website and governance][github_website]

    For discussing, proposing changes and reporting defects in the [CF
    website][website], and for discussion of CF governance.

No registration with CF is required to contribute; all that is needed
is a freely available [GitHub account][github].

Prior to December 2019, general discussion took place on the
[cf-metadata mailing list][archives], and enhancements were proposed
on the [CF Metadata Trac](Data/trac.html) site.
