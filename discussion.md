# Discussion
 
Discussion about CF Metadata takes place on GitHub in three locations:

1. [General discussion][github_discuss]

  * A forum for proposing standard names, any discussion about the
    interpretation and use of the CF conventions, and initial
    suggestions for proposals to change or extend the CF conventions.

    There is also a separate website detailing the [status of current
    proposals for new standard names][current] that have been
    initiated on the general discussion forum.
  
2. [Enhancements and defects][github_conventions]

  * Proposals for enhancements and possible defects to the CF
    conventions, that may or may not have started as conversations on
    the general discussion forum.

3. [Website discussion][github_website]

  * A forum for discussing and proposing changes to the [CF
    website][website].

No registration with CF is required to contribute; all that is needed
is a freely available [GitHub account][github].

Prior to December 2019, general discussion took place on the
[cf-metadata mailing list][archives], and enhancements were proposed
on the [CF Metadata Trac](Data/trac.html) site.
