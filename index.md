<br>The CF metadata conventions are designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">NetCDF API</a>.
The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data.
This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities.
The CF convention includes a standard name table, which defines strings that identify physical quantities.

Initially CF was developed for gridded data from climate and forecast models (hence "CF") of the atmosphere and ocean, but its use has subsequently extended to other geosciences, and to observations as well as numerical models.
The use of CF is recommended where applicable by Unidata.

<!-- From here onwards the formatting of this page is mostly controlled by HTML
tags, which are ignored by the Markdown processor. It's not clearly documented
what HTML tags can be used. Experiment shows that all block-level elements must
be closed, even those which don't have to be closed in HTML e.g. <p> and <li>
must have </p> and </li>. If they aren't closed, the Markdown processor
considers following HTML tags to be text. The classes used in the <div>s are
from Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com).  They allow column-handling which responds
to the width of the browser window.  Within each row-class <div>, the number of
columns N in the col-md-N-class <div>s should add up to 12, and the window is
divided into columns according to the proportions of the Ns. -->
